0,Richard Lawler,Google’s $2.3 million check helped the company get a trial by judge instead of jury,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173981/google-ad-monopoly-antitrust-lawsuit-damages,Google’s lawyers avoided the government’s attempt to have an antitrust lawsuit over its alleged online advertising monopoly heard by a jury.,2024-06-07T22:12:04Z,"By  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  The antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department and eight states seeking to break up Google’s alleged adtech monopoly will be heard by a judge this fall, as the company preferred. The government’s lawyers had included a damages claim in their lawsuit and pursued a trial by jury. Jury trials can be more unpredictable, like Epic’s courtroom win over Google last year, and a legal expert told The Verge that if the government was successful, it could make Google more likely to settle the case.  But Reuters reports that won’t happen after the company filed a copy of a $2.3 million cashier’s check — without admitting any liability or wrongdoing — that it said would be enough to cover triple the monetary damages requested by the government, if necessary, plus interest.  Now that US District Judge Leonie Brinkema has ruled on the matter, she’s scheduled a bench trial for September 9th to hear arguments from both sides. Meanwhile, the DOJ and Google continue to wait for a ruling on their big search antitrust showdown after making their closing arguments about a month ago.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
1,Tom Warren,Windows won’t take screenshots of everything you do after all — unless you opt in,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173499/microsoft-windows-recall-response-security-concerns,Microsoft is making its controversial AI-powered Recall feature optional. The changes come after security experts warned the feature could be a disaster for cybersecurity.,2024-06-07T16:08:36Z,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years. Microsoft says it’s making its new Recall feature in Windows 11 that screenshots everything you do on your PC an opt-in feature and addressing various security concerns. The software giant first unveiled the Recall feature as part of its upcoming Copilot Plus PCs last month, but since then, privacy advocates and security experts have been warning that Recall could be a “disaster” for cybersecurity without changes. Thankfully, Microsoft has listened to the complaints and is making a number of changes before Copilot Plus PCs launch on June 18th. Microsoft had originally planned to turn Recall on by default, but the company now says it will offer the ability to disable the controversial AI-powered feature during the setup process of new Copilot Plus PCs. “If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default,” says Windows chief Pavan Davuluri. Microsoft will also require Windows Hello to enable Recall, so you’ll either authenticate with your face, fingerprint, or using a PIN. “In addition, proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search in Recall,” says Davuluri, so someone won’t be able to start searching through your timeline without authenticating first. This authentication will also apply to the data protection around the snapshots that Recall creates. “We are adding additional layers of data protection including ‘just in time’ decryption protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates,” explains Davuluri. “In addition, we encrypted the search index database.” Recall uses local AI models to screenshot mostly everything you see or do on your computer and then give you the ability to search and retrieve anything in seconds. An explorable timeline lets you scroll through these snapshots with ease to look back on what you did on a particular day on your PC. Everything in Recall is designed to remain local and private on-device, so no data is used to train Microsoft’s AI models. Microsoft’s changes to the way the database is stored and accessed come after cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont discovered that Microsoft’s AI-powered feature currently stores data in a database in plain text. That could have made it easy for malware authors to create tools that extract the database and its contents. Several tools have appeared in recent days, promising to exfiltrate Recall data.  TotalRecall extracts the Recall database so you can easily view what text is stored and the screenshots that Microsoft’s feature has generated. NetExec appears to be getting its own Recall module soon that can access Recall folders and dump them so you can view the screenshots easily. These tools are all possible because there is currently no full encryption or protection on the Recall database. Microsoft developed the Recall feature under its new Secure Future Initiative (SFI) that the company has put in place to overhaul its software security after major Azure cloud attacks. Microsoft has had a rough few years of cybersecurity incidents, and the SFI is supposed to focus on security above all else. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even called on employees to make security Microsoft’s “top priority” recently, even if that means prioritizing it over new features. “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” said Nadella (emphasis his) in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. “In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.” Davuluri references Microsoft’s SFI principles in today’s response, noting that the company is taking action to improve Recall security. But it appears to be largely down to security researchers flagging these issues rather than Microsoft’s own security principles because surely these issues should have been flagged internally far before this launch.  Microsoft is also keen to stress that Recall will only be available on new Copilot Plus PCs that are designed to be secure-core PCs with advanced firmware safeguards and the company’s Pluton security processor that’s designed to protect against personal data theft from a PC. “As we always do, we will continue to listen to and learn from our customers, including consumers, developers and enterprises, to evolve our experiences in ways that are meaningful to them,” says Davuluri “We will continue to build these new capabilities and experiences for our customers by prioritizing privacy, safety and security first. We remain grateful for the vibrant community of customers who continue to share their feedback with us.” A weekly newsletter uncovering the secrets and strategy behind Microsoft’s era-defining bets on AI, gaming, and computing.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
2,Andrew J. Hawkins,Waymo issues software and mapping recall after robotaxi crashes into a telephone pole,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24175489/waymo-recall-telephone-poll-crash-phoenix-software-map,Waymo is recalling its driverless vehicle software after one of its robotaxis crashed into a telephone poll in Phoenix. It’s the Google spinoff’s second-ever recall.,2024-06-12T10:00:00Z,"By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Waymo is issuing a voluntary software recall after one of its driverless vehicles collided with a telephone pole in Phoenix, Arizona, last month, the company said. The vehicle was damaged, but no passengers or bystanders were hurt in the incident.  The company is filing the recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) after completing a software update to 672 vehicles — the total number of driverless-capable vehicles in Waymo’s fleet. The update corrects an error in the software that “assigned a low damage score” to the telephone pole, and updates its map to account for the hard road edge in the alleyway that was not previously included.  This is Waymo’s second recall ever This is Waymo’s second recall ever, after two minor collisions prompted a recall of 444 vehicles last February. And it comes at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny of the driverless vehicle industry, in which federal investigators are probing almost all the major companies operating autonomous vehicles in the US.  The incident that prompted the latest recall took place on May 21st in Phoenix. According to local reports, an unoccupied Waymo vehicle was driving to a passenger pickup location through an alley that was lined on both sides by wooden telephone poles. The poles were not up on a curb but level with the road and surrounded with longitudinal yellow striping to define the viable path for vehicles. As it was pulling over, the Waymo vehicle struck one of the poles at a speed of 8mph, sustaining some damage, the company said.  The passenger who was waiting for the vehicle didn’t witness the crash but did recall hearing it. “It never made it to pick us up,” Jericka Mitchell told 12News.  Waymo’s recall was deployed by the company’s engineers at the central depot where the vehicles return for regular maintenance and testing. It was not through an over-the-air software update, like some of Tesla’s recent recalls.  “We have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet” “We have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet, and this does not impact our current operations,” Waymo spokesperson Katherine Barna said in a statement. “As we serve more riders in more cities, we will continue our safety first approach, working to earn trust with our riders, community members, regulators, and policymakers.” Waymo is trying to be proactive about its safety — especially as it relates to incidents in which its own vehicles are clearly at fault. The company is under investigation by NHTSA for over two dozen incidents involving its driverless vehicles, including several “single-party” crashes and possible traffic law violations. Several incidents involved crashes with stationary objects, much like the May 21st crash with the telephone poll.  A number of pedestrians and other bystanders have been injured by driverless vehicles, resulting in more regulatory scrutiny and public ire. Meanwhile, the government is requiring more data from companies than ever before, especially around crashes, in order to determine whether the industry’s safety claims live up to their hype. And the companies are finding that the proliferation of smartphones with cameras is working against them, as more videos of their vehicles behaving unpredictably or dangerously go viral. Correction, June 12th: Waymo’s recall was deployed at the company’s depot by its team of engineers, not through an over-the-air software update.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Even Apple CEO Tim Cook isn’t sure the company can fully stop AI hallucinations. In an interview with The Washington Post, Cook said he would “never claim” that its new Apple Intelligence system won’t generate false or misleading information with 100 percent confidence. “I think we have done everything that we know to do, including thinking very deeply about the readiness of the technology in the areas that we’re using it in,” Cook says. “So I am confident it will be very high quality. But I’d say in all honesty that’s short of 100 percent. I would never claim that it’s 100 percent.” Apple revealed its new Apple Intelligence system during its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, which will bring AI features to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. These features will let you generate email responses, create custom emoji, summarize text, and more.  As is the case with all other AI systems, this also introduces the possibility of hallucinations. Recent examples of how AI can get things wrong include last month’s incident with Google’s Gemini-powered AI overviews telling us to use glue to put cheese on pizza or a recent ChatGPT bug that caused it to spit out nonsensical answers. Apple also announced that it’s partnering with OpenAI to build ChatGPT into Siri. The voice assistant will turn to ChatGPT when it receives a question better suited for the chatbot, but it will ask for your permission before doing so. In the demo of the feature shown during WWDC, you can see a disclaimer at the bottom of the answer that reads, “Check important info for mistakes.”  When asked about the integration, Cook said Apple chose OpenAI because the company is a “pioneer” in privacy, and it currently has “the best model.” Apple might not just partner with OpenAI down the road, either. Cook responded, “We’re integrating with other people as well.” During a post-keynote live session on Monday, Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi said Apple could eventually bring Google Gemini to iOS, too.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. Yahoo is updating Yahoo Mail on the desktop with new AI capabilities and other features to help simplify email and task management. One of the highlights is brief AI-generated summaries of emails. These summaries come complete with bulleted lists that highlight proposed tasks and other actions. It’s located under the new Priority inbox tab, which — like Gmail’s — uses AI to highlight what Yahoo thinks are your most important messages. Gmail recently announced a similar summaries feature for its mobile app, but it’s behind a paywall for Workspace and Google One AI Premium subscribers. Along with AI-powered summaries, Yahoo is also making it easier to quickly access and act upon emails. Quick action buttons will now appear directly inside the inbox, letting users quickly add an event to a calendar, check in for flights, and track packages. Meanwhile, a new persistent “starred view” panel lets users quickly see and access their most important tasks or other things they’d like to revisit.  Last but not least, Yahoo Mail users can now link their inbox to other email accounts, including Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and AOL, so users can send and receive all their emails from within Yahoo Mail.  “People are craving better ways to streamline the daily activities that often bog us down like managing multiple email accounts, sorting out their schedules, reading through long messages, and tracking orders. The new features we’re launching are aimed at making life that much easier for anyone that relies on email,” said Kyle Miller, Yahoo Mail’s VP of product. The features will be available to new users in the US and roll out to existing US users on an opt-in basis starting today. They’ll come to Yahoo Mail’s mobile app in the future. This isn’t Yahoo Mail’s first dip into the AI world. Last summer, Yahoo Mail added a slew of generative AI capabilities. These included an improved search mode, the Shopping Save  feature to help users find forgotten gift cards and discount codes, and a writing assistant to help users craft emails using the appropriate tone.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Spotify is getting ready to launch a premium add-on that offers access to high-fidelity audio, according to a report from Bloomberg. The new tier will reportedly cost $5 extra and will also come with tools to help users create playlists and manage music libraries. A source familiar with Spotify tells Bloomberg that users will be able to add the HiFi audio tier to their existing plans. If added to the Spotify Premium plan, which goes up in price to $11.99 next month, it will cost $16.99. Bloomberg reports that the add-on will also give users the ability to generate custom playlists for specific activities, dates, and times of year.

Alternatively, you can email welch@theverge.com or contact him via Instagram or X / Twitter DM. “At Spotify, we are constantly exploring ideas to improve our product offering and offer value to users,” Spotify spokesperson Grey Munford said in a statement to The Verge. “But we don’t comment on speculation around possible new features and do not have anything new to share at this time.” Spotify initially said its HiFi audio feature would arrive in 2021, but that never happened. Since then, we’ve heard many rumors about Spotify’s work on the tier, including last year’s report from Bloomberg that revealed the service is working on a higher-priced “Supremium” HiFi plan. Another report from The Wall Street Journal indicates that Spotify could bundle a remix feature to speed up tracks within the add-on. Code spotted within the Spotify app last year also suggests that the tier could come with 24-bit lossless audio, the ability to create playlists with AI, a feature that filters songs in a playlist by mood, and more. In April, a Reddit user spotted a string of code in the app that says “lossless has arrived,” while another Redditor later posted leaked UI elements mentioning lossless quality of up to 2,117kbps and the availability of 24-bit / 44.1kHz for “limited songs” using the FLAC audio format.

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. A hacker breached the systems behind Tile device trackers and stole customer data, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers. According to reporting from 404 Media, the hacker was able to collect customer information by accessing a tool made for responding to law enforcement requests about Tile trackers. The stolen information did not include precise Tile location data. Life360, which owns Tile, published a statement by CEO Chris Hulls acknowledging the hack. Hulls confirmed the data included Tile tracker IDs and said that the hacker had attempted to extort Life360 and that the company reported it to law enforcement. In an email to The Verge, Hulls wrote, “From what I gather, very little was accessed.” Hulls did not respond to a question about whether the company would contact affected customers. “We are continuing to work with law enforcement on the matter and have no other updates at this time,” Life360 representative Kristi Collura told The Verge in another email. “What is seen in the excerpted screenshot from 404 Media is a single step for Life360 personnel to initiate a request to respond to a law enforcement request for Tile user data,” Collura wrote. The hacker reportedly gained access using login credentials supposedly belonging to a former Tile employee. 404 Media was provided screenshots by the hacker indicating they had access to various internal tools designed to transfer ownership of a Tile tracker, add admin accounts, and send messages to Tile users. Correction, June 12th: An earlier version of this article misstated the Life360 tool accessed. It is a tool that’s part of the process for responding to law enforcement requests, not a tool used by law enforcement directly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
8,Gaby Del Valle,Meta says European regulators are ruining its AI bot,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178591/meta-ai-assistant-europe-ireland-privacy-objections,Meta said Ireland’s Data Protection Commission asked it to delay training LLMs on public user information.,2024-06-14T17:56:55Z,"By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. Meta is putting plans for its AI assistant on hold in Europe after receiving objections from Ireland’s privacy regulator, the company announced on Friday.  In a blog post, Meta said the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) asked the company to delay training its large language models on content that had been publicly posted to Facebook and Instagram profiles. Meta said it is “disappointed” by the request, “particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European [Data Protection Authorities] have been informed since March.” Per the Irish Independent, Meta had recently begun notifying European users that it would collect their data and offered an opt-out option in an attempt to comply with European privacy laws. Meta said it will “continue to work collaboratively with the DPC.” But its blog post says that Google and OpenAI have “already used data from Europeans to train AI” and claims that if regulators don’t let it use users’ information to train its models, Meta can only deliver an inferior product. “Put simply, without including local information we’d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren’t able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment.” European regulators, on the other hand, have welcomed the pause. “We are pleased that Meta has reflected on the concerns we shared from users of their service in the UK, and responded to our request to pause and review plans to use Facebook and Instagram user data to train generative AI,” Stephen Almond, the executive director of regulatory risk at the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, said in a statement.  The DPC’s request followed a campaign by the advocacy group NOYB — None of Your Business — which filed 11 complaints against Meta in several European countries, Reuters reports. NOYB founder Max Schrems told the Irish Independent that the complaint hinged on Meta’s legal basis for collecting personal data. “Meta is basically saying that it can use any data from any source for any purpose and make it available to anyone in the world, as long as it’s done via AI technology,” Schrems said. “This is clearly the opposite of GDPR compliance.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
9,Wes Davis,Apple Intelligence: every new AI feature coming to the iPhone and Mac,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175405/wwdc-apple-ai-news-features-ios-18-macos-15-iphone-ipad-mac,"These are all of the biggest AI features Apple announced are coming to its iPhone, iPad, Mac, and more at WWDC 2024.",2024-06-10T18:11:00Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Apple announced “Apple Intelligence” at WWDC 2024, its name for a new suite of AI features for the iPhone, Mac, and more. Starting later this year, Apple is rolling out what it says is a more conversational Siri, custom, AI-generated “Genmoji,” and GPT-4o access that lets Siri turn to OpenAI’s chatbot when it can’t handle what you ask it for.  The company that once refused to use the term “artificial intelligence” when talking about its machine learning features is now, as best as we can tell, catching up with just about all of the table-stakes features that Google, Microsoft, and others have rolled out in the last year. The company says the AI features will be available only on the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max and iPads or Macs with M1 or later chips, and only when their language is set to English. The features will start rolling out this fall in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. Apple said its AI features will carry out actions between apps, as well as manage notifications, automatically write things for you, and summarize text in mail and other apps. As with other built-in AI writing tools, you can change the tone of something you’re writing with a prompt. The company also says its AI features can do things like reference one app to carry out an action in another, such as asking it to play a podcast your partner sent you.  When you invoke Siri, Apple says it has “onscreen awareness,” meaning it can understand what you’re asking and “take action with users’ content in more apps over time.” The company says this will work in both Apple and third-party apps, as well. And you’ll be able to type to Siri, not just talk. Of course, this is Apple, so there’s a privacy story. The company says that many features will work on-device, where that’s possible. But when you ask for something more complicated, your device — whether an iPhone, Mac, or iPad — will make a call to shunt the request to the cloud automatically.  Apple says it’s using what it calls “Private Cloud Compute.” The models that process more complicated requests are servers “powered by Apple Silicon,” and the company says it will never store or be able to access your data on its servers. Also, the company says that it will let independent experts inspect code running on its servers “to verify privacy.”  Apple says it’s rolling out “Genmoji,” a new feature that will generate emoji-like reactions on the fly so that when you can’t find the one you want, you can just have it created for you by AI. Similarly, a new image generation feature is coming to iOS 18, called Image Playground. Apple says the feature works in several apps, but it also has its own app by the same name. It will also let developers access an API to include Image Playground on their devices.  Additionally, Apple is bringing AI to the Photos app. You can already search for objects pictured in your library, but Apple says it’s improving how this works in the future, so you can search for things like a person who is doing cartwheels. It also added features similar to Google’s Magic Eraser, like the ability to erase a person from a photo. ChatGPT, powered by GPT-4o, will come to iOS, macOS, and iPadOS “later this year,” as a chatbot that Siri can turn to when it’s not able to do what you ask. When it does this, Apple says it will ask your permission before it sends questions, documents, or photos to ChatGPT and that, after it responds, Siri will present its answers to you. Apple said it was starting with the best chatbot but that it would support other AI models down the road.  The company also says ChatGPT will be available to use in its systemwide AI writing tools, can be used to generate images, and that it obscures IP addresses. OpenAI won’t store user requests, either, Apple writes. Finally, while you won’t need to create an account or pay for ChatGPT; Apple says subscribers can connect their accounts to use paid features within the built-in integrations. OpenAI published the same information on its website.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
10,Jess Weatherbed,All three game console makers have now abandoned X integration,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175932/nintendo-switch-console-x-twitter-integration-removed,"The Nintendo Switch has officially discontinued its integration with X, making it the last major console to do so following Microsoft and Sony disabled their own access.",2024-06-11T11:08:54Z,"By  Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. As of June 10th, Nintendo has officially discontinued support for the Switch console’s integration with X (formerly Twitter), making it the last of the current-gen consoles to do so after Microsoft and Sony disabled their own access last year.  The integration was removed as part of the Nintendo Switch’s 18.1.0 update, taking away the ability for users to link their X account with the console, or post in-game screenshots from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate directly to the social media platform. The removal of these features comprised the majority of the 18.1.0 update, which also includes some general stability improvements and ditches support for linking social media accounts via the Switch’s Friend Suggestions feature. Nintendo announced these changes last month but didn’t explicitly state the reason for pulling support for X. Given Switch users can still share their content to Facebook, it likely has something to do with pricing changes to the X API which now starts at $42,000 a month for enterprise customers. Microsoft didn’t mention X’s API update when it removed the ability for Xbox consoles to share game uploads to the service last April, nor did Sony when it followed suit in November for the PS5 and PS4. Cost may not be the only factor as Slack said it had also pulled support because the API updates impacted the functionality of its own X integration, but regardless of the reason, console gamers will now have a hard time connecting directly with the platform.  That’s despite the X Gaming account saying in a now-deleted post that its “partnership with Nintendo remains strong” after Nintendo announced its plans to kill Switch support.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

New stories are coming throughout 2024, ahead of a Frontiers expansion in 2025.",2024-06-10T15:40:07Z,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor and author of Notepad, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years. Bungie just concluded the long-running saga of the light and darkness in Destiny 2: The Final Shape earlier this month, and now the Halo and Destiny developer is teasing what’s next. In a “journey ahead” stream today, Bungie disclosed the first details on its plans for the rest of the year ahead with Destiny 2 and even teased a 2025 release for new content that’s codenamed “Frontiers.” Until Frontiers arrives next year, Destiny 2 will continue with new episodes of story content that explore what’s happened after the conclusion of The Final Shape. Destiny 2 players have just battled The Witness in the latest expansion, the main antagonist of Destiny’s light and darkness saga, which has created what Bungie is calling echoes throughout the universe.  The first echo has landed on Nessus, which is why Destiny 2 players have noticed earthquakes occurring on that planet over the weekend. Nessus is changing, and so are the Vex enemies that inhabit it, which Destiny 2 players will start to discover this week as The Final Shape seasonal content begins with this first episode of stories.  Later in the year, the second echo, Revenant, will see the focus switch to the Fallen enemies, with Destiny 2 players turning into vampire hunters that have craftable potions. After Revenant the final episode is Heresy, which will focus on the Hive pantheon enemies. And yes, we’re heading back to the dreadnought to see what’s changed with the Hive. There will even be armor that’s themed around Eris Morn, Destiny’s very own Hive lore expert. After Heresy ends and year 11 of Destiny 2 begins in 2025, a new “Frontiers” drop of content is on the way. “The journey continues,” teases Bungie. It’s not clear what storyline the Frontiers content will cover, but it doesn’t seem to be the big annual expansion that Bungie typically puts out for Destiny 2. Either way, Bungie is making it clear that Destiny 2 isn’t going anywhere just yet, despite speculation over whether or not a Destiny 3 is on the way.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
12,Abigail Bassett,The surprisingly not so doomed effort to force US drivers to stop speeding,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176403/intelligent-speed-assistance-iihs-safety-limiters-governor,"Intelligent speed assistance, which prevents drivers from speeding, is gaining public acceptance, according to a surprising new survey.",2024-06-12T12:57:20Z,"By  Abigail Bassett California Senator Scott Wiener is used to pushback when he proposes laws aimed at reining in reckless drivers and improving road safety in his car-dependent state. But even he was caught off guard when, earlier this year, he introduced a new bill requiring a speed “governor” on all new cars sold in the state. The opposition from drivers was so fierce that he had to rewrite the proposal to only require weaker versions of the technology. “There were people who loved it, people who hated it, people who were mad at me, spouses who were arguing with each other about it,” Wiener said in an interview. “It was an interesting situation. There’s a certain cultural embrace of being able to drive your car however you want to drive your car.”  Speeding is part of our cultural identity. Automakers frequently advertise new cars tearing through empty cities or weaving through traffic well above safe speeds. Movies and television shows frequently push these boundaries further. And social media further glorifies lawbreaking by providing a platform for speedsters. It all perpetuates the idea that speeding is not only safe but an American right. “There’s a certain cultural embrace of being able to drive your car however you want to drive your car.” Yet speeding is one of the most deadly things you can do in a vehicle. In 2023, more than 40,000 people died in traffic accidents, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data released in April of this year. That’s down about 3.6 percent from 2022, when crashes accounted for nearly 43,000 deaths. The previous year was even worse, with speeding fatalities reaching a 14-year high.  A study from 2020, showed that at speeds above 42mph, there’s a much higher incidence of serious injury and a higher risk of death for vehicle occupants. According to 2021 crash test data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, at 56mph and above, the driver’s compartment in most modern vehicles showed significant damage, and crash test dummies registered severe injuries to the neck and lower legs.  “Driver’s behavior is the overwhelming cause of traffic crashes,” Jonathan Adkins, CEO of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “We’re driving too fast or drinking, we’re not wearing our seatbelt. We’re distracted by our cell phones. It’s all those behaviors that lead to the vast majority of crashes.” Salvation could come from technology like intelligent speed assistance (ISA) systems, but there’s a lot of nuance. These systems use cameras, radar, and lidar in conjunction with GPS data to detect both the speed of your vehicle and “read” the speed limit signs on the road.  In most modern vehicles, these systems are “passive” in that they don’t physically slow a speeding vehicle. A notification may pop up if you’re going more than a few miles per hour over the speed limit, but it won’t physically limit your ability to speed. Active ISA systems will physically slow your vehicle to keep you at the speed limit. Some use tactile responses, like pushing the accelerator back into your foot, while others actively limit the engine power to keep you at the speed limit. These active systems can be turned on and off by the driver.  “Driver’s behavior is the overwhelming cause of traffic crashes.” The EU has been at the forefront of ISA, and as of July of this year, all new vehicles will be required to have the passive form of this technology. The US is well behind Europe’s regulations, but many are trying to change that. NHTSA has been working on studies and proposals for some form of ISA mandate, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has a proposal out for limiters on commercial vehicles. Local officials in California and New York have proposed laws to require passive ISA systems in all new cars.  While conflicts around speed limiters are not new, they have certainly become more deeply ingrained, thanks in part to the covid-19 pandemic and political division. According to Adkins, speeding got worse when everyone was forced to stay home. “The people that were out, were speeding, they were way more aggressive because they knew they had the space, and they knew they could get away with it,” he said.   Local governments set the speed limits on state and local roads, while the federal government is responsible for setting speed limits on interstate highways. In the last few years, some states have raised the speed limits in the service of driver convenience, with 41 states permitting 70mph or more on some routes. Texas has the fastest speed limit on State Highway 130, a toll road that bypasses Austin, with a limit of 85mph.  While Americans love the freedom to drive where they want, as fast as they want, a study released today from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows that consumers may be more open to technology like ISA than previously thought.  According to Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the institute who designed the survey, more than 60 percent of the 1,800 drivers who participated said they would be open to some form of passive ISA system in new cars.  Active ISA systems will physically slow your vehicle to keep you at the speed limit “Acceptability is key,” Reagan said. “There’s a lot of data in the study that suggests that there are a number of options for designers that would allow them to implement systems that are accepted by drivers.”   Even more surprising was that 50 percent of those surveyed said they’d be open to active ISA, including tech that makes the accelerator pedal harder to press or automatically restricts speed. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data notes that drivers would have the option to turn any active ISA system on and off as they see fit, making the technology only useful if it’s accepted and utilized by drivers.  While this is a small bright spot when it comes to potentially reducing speed-related accidents on US roads, there is still a long way to go. After all, it took nearly 50 years of advocacy from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving to stigmatize driving under the influence. And it took nearly that long for drivers to get on board with wearing their seatbelts. “I think we’ll get there,” Adkins said, “but it’s going to take some time, and we have to do this thoughtfully.”  ISA technology is also only one part of the solution. Even more accidents are caused by distracted drivers using their cellphones, and road design plays a significant role in speeding and accidents. The legislation in California, should it pass the Assembly, could significantly change the playing field for ISA technology since the state is the largest new car market in the country.  “The bill does not stop you from speeding, but you should at least be alerted,” Wiener said. “We know that, yes, there are people who intentionally drive very fast, but there are a lot of people who don’t, and they don’t even realize it. So this technology is not going to get everyone to slow down, but if it gets a quarter or a third or a half of people to slow down, that will save many, many lives.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
13,Andrew Webster,Metallica is headlining Fortnite’s next concert,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176228/metallica-fortnite-concert,"Fortnite will feature Metallica in a series of in-game concerts starting on June 22nd, and the band will also appear in Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing.",2024-06-12T15:01:09Z,"By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. It’s sad but true: Metallica is coming to Fortnite. Epic just announced that the group will be featured in the game’s next concert. The news is part of a larger musical collaboration between Fortnite and the heavy metal band. First up, the concert itself. It’s called “Metallica: Fuel Fire Fury,” and players can check it out during a few windows later this month: June 22nd at 2PM, 5PM, and 11PM ET and June 23rd at 10AM, 2PM, and 5PM ET. There aren’t many details on what the virtual show will entail, but it’ll be the latest in a line of in-game concerts from the likes of Eminem, Ariana Grande, Travis Scott, and Marshmello. Now that Fortnite is more than a battle royale (though that remains the most popular mode), Epic is spreading the Metallica experience across the ecosystem. The band will be the featured act in the music game Fortnite Festival starting on June 13th, taking over for Billie Eilish, and there will be a new “Thrash Mountain” track in Rocket Racing. Not only are all four members of Metallica going to be featured in the game but there will also be Lego versions of them as well. Fortnite’s battle royale is currently in the midst of a postapocalyptic season reminiscent of Mad Max, complete with a wasteland biome and vehicular combat. Lego Fortnite, meanwhile, just got a big update that introduced two new difficulty mode: cozy and expert.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
14,Emma Roth,Elon Musk drops lawsuit against OpenAI,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176462/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit-sam-altman-dropped,"Elon Musk was suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, for a breach of contract, but now the lawsuit has been dropped.",2024-06-11T21:29:42Z,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Elon Musk has dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, accusing the company of a breach of contract and allegedly abandoning its mission of creating AI technology to benefit humanity. As reported earlier by CNBC, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Musk can file it again. Musk’s decision to withdraw the lawsuit, filed in a California state court in February (case number CGC24612746), comes just one day before a scheduled hearing where the judge would’ve reviewed OpenAI’s request to dismiss the case. It’s also one day after Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies if the company integrates OpenAI’s technology into the iPhone and Mac “at the OS level,” among other bizarre threats.  His lawsuit alleged that OpenAI breached an agreement reached with Musk and other founding members, all of whom committed to making OpenAI a nonprofit and keeping its technology open source.  However, as pointed out by The Verge’s Nilay Patel, there were some problems with Musk’s case: Musk is straightforwardly alleging that OpenAI breached a contract that does not exist. It is simply not a thing! The complaint makes reference to a “Founding Agreement,” but no such Founding Agreement is attached as an exhibit, and the breach of contract claim admits that the “Founding Agreement” is basically a vibe everyone caught in some emails. OpenAI denied Musk’s claims shortly after he filed the lawsuit, saying the billionaire wanted “absolute control” of the company by merging it with Tesla. The company also said there is “no agreement at all” with Musk.”  Last year, Musk founded an AI company of his own, called xAI, which has created the Grok AI chatbot that’s available with an X Premium subscription. The startup has since raised $6 billion from investors to fund the costly chips needed to power its AI system. Last week, CNBC reported on emails suggesting Musk diverted thousands of Nvidia H100 AI chips that had been reserved for Tesla and had them sent to X.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
15,Ash Parrish,The 10 best games from the Day of the Devs showcase,https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best,The Day of the Devs showcase hosted by iam8bit and Double Fine is one of the most exciting indie game showcases during Summer Game Fest.,2024-06-08T00:00:00Z,"By  Ash Parrish, a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and writing about the intersection of video games and sex. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Day of the Devs showcase hosted by iam8bit is, to me, far more exciting than the main Summer Game Fest presentation. While it is fun to get hyped for the big releases, Day of the Devs represents something more concrete. The games featured get their own mini-spotlights with developer commentary and gameplay videos. It gives viewers a clearer picture of what these games are about, especially compared to the seconds-long (and apparently exorbitantly expensive) sizzle reels or teaser trailers shown during the Keigh-3 keynote. My only problem, though, is that there are a lot of games to get excited about, making it hard to narrow it down to the 10 best. Rock climbing isn’t my thing. In fact, it looks terrifying, and that terror is what makes Cairn look so interesting. In Cairn, you must reach the summit of Mount Kami one piton at a time. You can climb anywhere, but just like in real mountain climbing, you’ll often face sheer walls and unpassable overhangs that force you to find another way up. One of the things I was immediately drawn to was the way the character’s legs shake as they climb, giving the game an air of urgency and danger that I want to experience for myself. Karma: The Dark World is a disturbing-looking game from Pollard Studio. It’s a psychological horror game in which you must investigate the mysteries of the dystopian real world and uncover truths in the gross, wet, and slimy world of people’s minds. It looks freaky in that Silent Hill kind of way, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say the horror hottie looking in the mirror is one of the things that really piqued my interest. Getting introduced to quirky lil’ games is one of my favorite things about Day of the Devs. Last time, it was Time Flies; this time, it’s UFO50. I love the premise of this game — you play through an assortment of 50 games to see the evolution of a fictional video game developer throughout the 1980s. Each game is complete and unique, and you’ll be able to see graphical and technical improvements in the games as the decade wears on. With cats overtaking the cute animal video game meta, I’m glad for games like Koira that reassert the supremacy of man’s best friend. I also love how Koira uses music and sound to communicate instead of dialogue or text. Can’t have a best-of list without at least one puzzle game. In Arranger, you... well, rearrange tiles to get around the world with every row and column moving when you do. Shuffle your environment around to bring a key to a locked door or get around a barrier by using the end of a row to warp around to the beginning. The game reminds me of Carto, another puzzle game that I loved, which is apt considering one of the developers on that game is working on Arranger.  Screenbound is one of those games where you look at a short clip and immediately get it. It’s a platforming game in which you use a 2D gaming handheld to navigate a 3D space. Defeat enemies in the 3D world that you can only see on the 2D handheld and use objects from the 3D world to solve 2D platforming puzzles.  In Zoochosis, you’re a rookie zookeeper tasked with taking care of all of the animals. Even the mutated ones — especially the mutated ones.  Can’t ignore a pitch that goes, “the most stupid game you’ll see all day.” Building Relationships is a housing dating sim... I think. I love the inherent goofiness of this game, from the silly way Tanat Boozayaangool explains the pun to the way the house protagonist gets around by rolling like a katamari. One of my favorite games from a previous Day of the Devs showcase is getting yet another DLC update, and I’m going to be there no matter what. A Little to the Left lets you bring order to your cluttered life with a collection of puzzles designed to soothe your inner neat freak. Fix something like a messy stack of books the simple way by putting them back on the shelves or go for one of the less obvious solutions by arranging them via color or alphabetically.  While Waiting is another one of those games where I’m immediately charmed by the premise. It’s a game about all the shenanigans you can get up to while waiting for other things to happen. If you’re clever enough with how you use your time, maybe you can eliminate waiting entirely.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
16,Jay Peters,The AI upgrade cycle is here,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24176494/apple-intelligence-ai-upgrade-cycle-here,"The new Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18 could be impressive, but they might also just be driving another upgrade cycle.",2024-06-12T12:00:00Z,"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. The new Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18 could be the most impressive integrations of AI software and consumer hardware to date. Apple’s AI tools will be able to take actions based on what they know about you, manage your notifications, and rewrite text. They’re the kinds of things that could make day-to-day use of your iPhone a lot better. But they won’t be available unless you have one of Apple’s latest and most expensive iPhone models. AI has quickly become the latest entry in the tech industry’s never ending desire to drive an upgrade cycle. A few years ago, every smartphone maker raced to 5G; more than a decade ago, the TV industry pushed for 3D TVs. Right now, every tech company clearly sees an opportunity with AI and is adding AI features confined to their latest and greatest devices as a result. But like the race to 5G, the mad rush toward AI is happening quickly and before the tech has been proven useful and its problems ironed out. To use Apple Intelligence on an iPhone, you’ll need to have an iPhone 15 Pro (which starts at $999) or iPhone 15 Pro Max (which starts at $1,199). That probably comes as a disappointment to iPhone 15 and 15 Plus users, who have phones that aren’t even a year old. iPad and Mac users are luckier: you’ll need to be running one of those devices with an M1 chip or newer to try Apple Intelligence for yourself, so any device from the past few years will work. (The M-series chips, of course, have been another Apple-encouraged reason to upgrade your gear.) Apple isn’t necessarily playing tricks here, as there is a real need for improved hardware to run advanced AI systems. AI processing is demanding. And Apple isn’t the only tech company gating some of its best new AI software features to specific hardware. Only the new Copilot Plus PCs from Microsoft and others will support some AI features in Windows like the (controversial) Recall. With its Pixel devices, Google initially said its Gemini Nano model would only be available on its Pixel 8 Pro, even though the regular Pixel 8 has the same Tensor G3 chipset. On the other hand, it’s not clear how firm those hardware limitations really are. Apple hasn’t said exactly why older iPhones can’t use Apple Intelligence. Many AI features are local, but more advanced queries are often offloaded to the cloud. And given that Google recently said that the Pixel 8 actually will be able to run Gemini Nano, the limitations may not be as cut and dry as the tech companies make it seem. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about the hardware restrictions. As an iPhone 12 Mini super fan, this potential upgrade push is a huge bummer. Since its 2020 launch, the small phone has remained pretty much perfect for me even with its lackluster battery. I haven’t had any significant reason to upgrade my phone for years, saving me bundles of money while still getting to use the vast majority of new features included with iOS upgrades. I’ve been hoping to hold onto my Mini phone until it goes kaput. But if these Apple Intelligence features actually work, I might end up getting a new iPhone much sooner than I expected. To be fair, you don’t have to upgrade your devices just because of some new AI features. iOS 18 will be available to every iPhone that runs iOS 17 — devices going back to 2018’s iPhone XR and XS — meaning that a lot of people will still get features like improved Home Screen customization, handy new Messages tools (tapbacks with any emoji!), and the Passwords app. And you can of course keep on using your current Windows machine and Pixel phones if they’re serving you well. But you can be sure that Apple, Microsoft, Google, and others are going to continue to pack their operating systems with new AI features that require better hardware. Clearly, they think (or maybe just hope) that the features will be compelling enough to make an upgrade a lot more enticing, even if you don’t really need it.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Andrew Liszewski has long been one of my favorite bloggers on the internet. He spent years at Gizmodo writing about the weirdest, funniest, silliest, coolest stuff on the web, and I’ve definitely spent thousands of dollars on stuff just because he wrote about it. Now, Andrew works for The Verge! This was his first week, and he’s already in Slack causing chaos. It’s the best. I asked him to share his homescreen with us to see if I could get any tips on how he scours the web. He didn’t reveal all his secrets, but I do know more about the weather in Canada now, so that’s something. Here’s Andrew’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone: iPhone 12 Pro (with a battery that’s feeling its age). The wallpaper: I like a very minimalist wallpaper under my apps, but because I find solid black makes the screen too reflective, I created a custom subtle blue gradient I’ve been using for the past five years. (For my lock screen, I’m using one of Mikael Gustafsson’s dreamy nature scenes.) The apps: Google Calendar, Clock, Photos, Camera, Google Home, Google Photos, Find My, Instagram, Google Maps, WeatherCAN, Nest, Google Chat, Settings, Watch, Chrome, Apple Books, 1Password, App Store, Apple Notes, Phone, Gmail, Messages, Apple Photos. My iPhone’s main homescreen is where all my daily driver apps live. This includes Instagram, Google Home, the aging Nest app (which includes functionality for my Nest thermostat I can’t find elsewhere), Chrome, 1Password (which all but solved my password anxiety once I finally switched over), IMDb, Paprika 3, countless smart home remotes, and most importantly, the Environment Canada weather app so I know when to get the grass cut before it rains. I’m obsessive about clearing notifications on my primary homescreen but am happy for them to pile up on the second screen, where I like to keep all other installed apps accessible. I also asked Andrew to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back: Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well!

Anyway, I ordered one a few months back and recently swapped it into my 20-inch G4, and it worked like a charm! I plugged it into a M1 Mac Mini I had, and now I’m using an iMac G4 like it’s 2004 again.” – Ryan “I LOVE the Surface kickstand, enjoy typing onscreen (have done it for 14 years, tbf), and hate cases on my Apple devices. I’m obsessed with this magnet-back cover with a kickstand for my iPad. Could only source it from Amazon Germany, but they shipped to New Zealand for free.

This made a lot of people have feelings and ask questions, even though I’m totally right. (It’s just science. I don’t make the rules.) But for all the people who asked for tips, here are mine.  The perfect 25-minute nap involves three things. First, realizing that even if you don’t sleep, lying there with your eyes closed for 25 minutes is still very restful; not stressing about sleeping makes it easier to sleep. Second, an episode of a TV show I’ve seen before (I do a lot of Parks and Recreation) can make it easier to quiet my brain and fall asleep. Third, I put on my smartwatch and set an alarm there; waking up from a wrist buzz is infinitely better than a blaring sound. Naps are great, naps forever, happy napping, everybody.

After months of teases and speculation, Summer Game Geoff is finally here kicking off a weekend full of presentations and special announcements. Even though the showcase is essentially a hype trailer for the video game industry, filling in the marketing hole E3 left behind, Summer Game Fest got its own hype trailer reminding us of what games to expect. The main keynote took place on June 7th, and featured a handful of big reveals: Civilization 7, Lego Horizon Adventures, a first look at the Among Us animated series, and news that Riot’s shooter Valorant is finally coming to Xbox and PlayStation. It’s followed by a number of indie-focused events, as well as big showcases from the likes of Xbox and Ubisoft. Stay tuned right here for all of the latest trailers and announcements as they happen. Jun 12 Andrew Webster Summer Game Fest has officially wrapped up — you can check out all of the major announcements right here — and unsurprisingly host Geoff Keighley has confirmed that the multi-day showcase will be back in LA in 2025. Jun 11 Andrew Webster Summer Game Fest can be hard to keep track of. The sprawling event is spread out across several days, ranging from blockbuster keynotes like SGF Live and the Xbox Games Showcase to smaller indie focused streams like Devolver Direct and Day of the Devs. Some games even have their own dedicated showcases. That means there’s a lot to see, which also means it’s tough to see it all. So we’ve combed through each event and pulled out the best trailers to give you a good overview of what went down and what the next few months of video game releases will look like. Not only did Remedy show off the first expansion for Alan Wake 2, but the studio also launched it: so if you’re interested in the very Twin Peaks-inspired new storylines (which include lots of coffee), you can play them right now. Jun 11 Andrew Webster It has a new name and now a first gameplay trailer: here’s your first proper look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The clip was released as the final portion of Summer Game Fest and followed an announcement from BioWare that the next Dragon Age would no longer be called Dreadwolf. The studio says that the footage shown here, which includes around 15 minutes of actual gameplay, takes place during the “opening moments of the game,” and has been edited somewhat to avoid spoilers. It shows off some of the combat, conversations, and a handful of cutscenes. Earlier during Summer Game Fest, the developer released a short trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase, which showed off a few of the new characters in the fantasy RPG: Jun 11 Ash Parrish One would think after spending a summer screaming about kissing bears in Baldur’s Gate or gods in Hades 2 that my primary concern for Dragon Age: The Veilguard — a game from a studio known for its robust character writing and romanceable companions — would be who I’m picking to smooch. But after three games spanning almost two decades, all I really wanted out of the next Dragon Age was a skin tone that matched mine and didn’t look like I’d never seen a bottle of moisturizer. So I know there is a Maker who loves me when one of the very first features that game director Corinne Busche showed me was all the different skin tones in Veilguard’s character creator. Jun 11 Andrew Webster But now it’s almost time to finally see some Dragon Age: The Veilguard gameplay. EA is closing out Summer Game Fest with a new trailer you can check out at 11AM ET. Jun 10 Andrew Webster The reveal of Assassin’s Creed Shadows mostly focused on its story, characters, and setting. But a new trailer gives a better idea of how the game will actually play. The lengthy gameplay overview, which clocks in at around 12 minutes long, shows off the game’s sprawling rendition of Japan, while also detailing the different skills and approaches of its two playable leads. It’s also very bloody. This is the game’s second gameplay trailer in as many days. Ubisoft also released a shorter clip during the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday: Jun 10 Andrew Webster Ubisoft’s troubled Prince of Persia remake is still coming, but not for a while: the publisher now says it’ll be out in 2026. Jun 10 Andrew Webster We’re getting very close to the launch of Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft’s Grand Theft Auto-style take on a galaxy far, far away. Which means it’s a good time for another trailer detailing the sorts of criminal escapades players can get into. The new overview focused primarily on the different Star Wars locations you’ll be exploring and the various not exactly legal missions you’ll take on. Among various aspects featured are dealing with the Hutts, riding a speeder bike, and finding new recruits for your scoundrel gang. You can get a quicker taste of the gameplay in the video above, or check out this 10-minute-long deep dive: Jun 10 Andrew Webster Summer Game Fest is nearly over, but not until Ubisoft has its say. The publisher’s keynote kicks off at 3PM ET, and you can expect more details on its big upcoming releases: Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Jun 9 Andrew Webster It’s a mad world once again. At its Xbox Games Showcase at Summer Game Fest, Microsoft revealed the latest entry in the sci-fi shooter series: Gears of War E-Day. It’s being developed by The Coalition, Xbox’s internal studio dedicated to all things Gears. The game doesn’t currently have a release date, but it being built on Unreal Engine 5. The announcement trailer harkens back to the classic “Mad World” commercial for the original Gears. Fittingly, E-Day is set 14 years before the first Gears, and “tells the story of the first Locust emergence on Sera.” It once again stars Marcus Fenix and is being billed as an origin story. Jun 9 Tom Warren Microsoft is making the white version of the Xbox Series X official today. The new console option won’t include a disc drive, and will be entirely all-digital. Inside it’s identical to the Xbox Series X, with the same performance for existing Xbox games. This new white model will be available with 1TB of storage later this year, priced at $449.99. Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed the new white Xbox Series X during the Xbox Games Showcase today, alongside a 2TB “Galaxy Black” version of the original Xbox Series X. There’s also a $349.99 1TB Xbox Series S coming in white, too. Jun 9 Andrew Webster We got a very tiny glimpse at the next AC game, but fear not: a much deeper look is coming, with Ubisoft hosting its own showcase on Monday at 3PM ET. Jun 9 Tom Warren Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase is full of release dates today, but we still don’t have an exact one for Avowed. Obsidian’s upcoming first-person RPG is still arriving in 2024, though. I heard from sources a few months ago that it was targeting a November release. Last year, we got a good look at Avowed and a promise of a 2024 launch, and we’re getting much of the same today. Jun 9 Andrew Webster The star of the original Life is Strange is back in an all-new “supernatural murder mystery” called Double Exposure. It somehow involves solving a crime across two different timelines. It’ll be launching on October 29th. Jun 9 Tom Warren Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is arriving on Xbox and PC on November 12th. The next installment in the legendary franchise will include hot air balloon trips, aerial firefighting, and much more. During the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 developer Asobo showed off commercial flight, air ambulances, and even aerial advertising. Asobo has been working on adding a variety of new planes to the game, and you’ll even be able to fly as part of a search and rescue team, or help with agricultural aviation and aerial firefighting. Asobo has also been working on additions like air racing, skydive aviation, and even VIP chartered services. Jun 9 Tom Warren Microsoft is officially putting a release window on Fable, which is now set to arrive at some point in 2025. After an initial trailer at last year’s Xbox summer showcase, today, we got to see some early gameplay. The new footage was mostly focused on the characters and story of the fantasy game. Fable will be centered on a hero named Humphry, who “will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence.” It appears that choice will once again play a big part in the experience, though not a lot of hard details have been revealed about the game just yet. Jun 9 Tom Warren It’s been four years since we first found out that a new Perfect Dark game was on the way, and now Microsoft has revealed the first gameplay during the Xbox Games Showcase today. The new Perfect Dark is a reboot of the original game, being developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. In the gameplay trailer we got a first look at Joanna Dark in a near-future Cairo setting. “Team Perfect Dark has pulled inspiration from elements of the first two games, but crafted an entirely new story and universe around them for this reboot,” says Xbox wire editor in chief Joe Skrebels. Jun 9 Andrew Webster Diablo IV’s next major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, now has a release date: it’s launching on October 8th. And naturally, we have a dark and gruesome cinematic trailer to go with the news. Jun 9 Andrew Webster Retold, which serves as a definitive edition of the classic RTS, finally has a release date: it’ll be hitting PC and Xbox on September 4th. Jun 9 Andrew Webster Microsoft announced that the MMO’s next expansion — which is called The War Within and kicks off a major new arc for the game — will launch on August 26th. In the meantime, here’s a classic Blizzard cinematic. Jun 9 Andrew Webster The Fallout games have seen a big boost in popularity since the live-action TV series, and Fallout 76 is primed to take advantage of that with its next major expansion. It’s called Skyline Valley, and for the first time, it will actually expand the game’s map, introducing a new Shenandoah region in the south. Bethesda says that players will “investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63 where they will meet its dwellers and discover a shocking new Ghoul type – The Lost.” You can get a feel for the expansion in the trailer above, though it won’t be long before you can play it, as Skyline Valley launches on June 12th. The trailer also teased a much-requested feature coming to the game in early 2025: you’ll finally be able to play as a ghoul, though maybe not one quite as cool as The Ghoul. Jun 9 Andrew Webster Bethesda’s sci-fi universe is about to get bigger. Bethesda has finally unveiled Shattered Space, the first major expansion for Starfield, which comes nearly a year after the open-world RPG debuted. Based on the first trailer, it has a much darker tone than the main Starfield campaign. No release date was revealed, but it’s coming sometime in 2024. Here’s the official premise: Jun 9 Andrew Webster The rumors were true: the next Doom is heading to a dark fantasy realm. At Xbox’s big June showcase event, id Software officially unveiled the next entry in the demonic shooter series, which is called Doom: The Dark Ages. As the name implies, it takes the franchise back to a medieval-like era, with the slayer killing enemies in a more fantasy realm. In that way, it seems to serve as a prequel of sorts. It still looks as gruesome and gory as ever, though. Also, you can fly on some kind of cyberpunk dragon. The game is launching in 2025, and will be coming to Xbox (including Game Pass), PC, and PS5. Jun 9 Wes Davis Critical Hit Games’ Nobody Wants to Die got its first gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest’s Future Games Show.  A neo-noir, time-controlling detective story, Nobody looks like a slick. moody blend of Bioshock, Blade Runner, and maybe even The Fifth Element. So I’ll be buying it, no matter what reviewers say. It’s out July 17th on Steam, Xbox Series X / S, and PS5. Jun 9 Tom Warren Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will debut on October 25th. The next installment in the popular franchise will be set in the early ’90s, and it will launch day one on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service. Developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, Black Ops 6 will include a new campaign, a multiplayer mode with 16 new maps at launch, and a new zombies experience.  The main campaign is set after Black Ops Cold War and even includes flashbacks to Black Ops 2. It’s all set in the early 1990s during the end of the Cold War. Raven Software has developed the campaign, which includes immersive spy missions amid government conspiracies. The game will be set across Southern Europe, the Russian Tundra, the US, and the Middle Eastern desert.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
19,Sheena Vasani,The OnePlus Buds 3 are available for free with a discounted OnePlus Watch 2,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177705/oneplus-watch-2-buds-3-deal-sale,OnePlus is throwing in the OnePlus Buds 3 for free with the OnePlus Watch 2. You can also save $30 on the wearable.,2024-06-13T16:05:43Z,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you’re looking for an Android smartwatch but aren’t keen on Google’s and Samsung’s selections, the OnePlus Watch 2 is our favorite alternative. And right now, not only is it on sale for $269.99 ($30 off) directly from the site, but OnePlus is throwing in a free pair of OnePlus Buds 3. While we’ve seen the OnePlus Watch 2 at this price before, this is the first time you can get it bundled with the $99.99 OnePlus Buds 3, saving you a total of $130. Its 47mm case might be a bit large for smaller wrists, but the OnePlus Watch 2 still stands out amongst its rivals because it’s the only third-party Wear OS watch running Wear OS 4. What’s impressive, too, is that it natively supports Google Assistant, lets you access all the third-party apps in the Google Play Store, and even features contactless payments. Plus, the watch’s battery can last nearly four days with regular use, which almost makes up for the fact that it lacks LTE connectivity.  Aside from being a good smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 2 is also great for fitness tracking. It offers all the standard features you’d expect, as well as dual-frequency GPS for more accurate data in the outdoors. That said, there are some tradeoffs — you don’t get features found in some of its rivals, like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. However, if you’re comfortable going without those, this is a good deal at this price — especially as it integrates well with other OnePlus devices, such as the OnePlus Buds 3.  Like the OnePlus Watch 2, the Buds 3 offers impressive features for their price. They’re equipped with active noise cancellation that can actually adjust to the shape of your ear canal, for example. They also come with other conveniences, like multipoint support as well as an IP55 rating for sweat resistance, offering some extra peace of mind. The OnePlus Watch 2 has Wear OS 4, multiday battery life, dual-frequency GPS, and helps fill the void left by Fossil exiting the Android smartwatch space.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
20,Andrew Liszewski,Bumblebee joins Optimus Prime as the next Transformers Lego set,https://www.theverge.com/24177038/lego-transformers-bumblebee-set-beetle,Optimus Prime will finally have backup when Lego’s 950-piece transforming Bumblebee releases on July 1st for $90.,2024-06-13T13:00:00Z,"By  Andrew Liszewski, a senior reporter who's been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Two years after Lego revealed a buildable model of the Transformers’ Optimus Prime that actually transformed, the heroic Autobot leader is finally getting backup with his second-in-command, Bumblebee, debuting as a 950-piece set that transforms into a Volkswagen Beetle — or at least a close facsimile thereof. In recent years, thanks to the run of big-budget Transformers movies, Bumblebee is best known for transforming into a bright yellow Chevrolet Camaro. But in the original ’80s toy line and animated series, Bumblebee’s alternate vehicle mode was the iconic Volkswagen Beetle. As with its Optimus Prime set, Lego is sticking to the original ’80s designs of the Transformers characters for Bumblebee. But while Lego does have a history of working with Volkswagen to create authentic-looking brick-built models of the automaker’s Beetle and camper vans, the Lego Bumblebee’s vehicle mode looks like a loose interpretation of the beloved VW bug, with a dash of classic Citroën and Peugeot cars added for good measure. Hasbro’s original Bumblebee toy wasn’t a perfect dupe of the VW Beetle, either, so this might make Lego’s interpretation feel even more authentic to nostalgic collectors who grew up playing with Transformers toys 40 years ago. But given the level of accuracy Lego includes with its smaller and cheaper Speed Champions sets, some, including myself, might be a little disappointed with Bumblebee when he transforms and rolls out. Transforming modern Transformers toys can sometimes feel as complex as solving a Rubik’s Cube, but converting Bumblebee between his robot and vehicle modes appears to be a far less frustrating experience, although Lego hasn’t shared exactly how many steps the process involves. There does appear to be one minor compromise in the transformation process. Bumblebee’s windshield needs to be completely removed before fully transforming from vehicle to robot modes, but Lego has attempted to appease Transformers fans by having the windshield itself transform into a jetpack, allowing Bumblebee to fly — some imagination required. Other accessories include a display plaque listing Bumblebee’s stats (fans may contest his strength and firepower being ranked at a meager two and one, respectively, but for courage, it’s a solid 10) and a buildable ion blaster. Few Lego fans like to see a giant sheet of stickers included with a set, but a pair of cute bumper stickers and a vanity license plate appear to at least make the painstaking application process worth it for Bumblebee. The set’s best feature might be its price tag. When available starting on July 1st for Lego Insiders (a loyalty program that’s free to sign up for) or July 4th for everyone else, the 950-piece Bumblebee will be almost $100 cheaper than the 1,508-piece, $180 Lego Optimus Prime at $89.99, €89.99, or £79.99.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
21,Kylie Robison,X all-hands leaves staff with few answers on delayed promotions,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24172268/x-twitter-all-hands-linda-yaccarino-layoffs-promotions,X CEO Linda Yaccarino addressed staff in a company all-hands on Wednesday evening as rumors inside Elon Musk’s company point to more layoffs on the horizon.,2024-06-13T03:21:33Z,"By  Kylie Robison,  a senior AI reporter working with The Verge's policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.  During an internal all-hands meeting led by X CEO Linda Yaccarino on Wednesday, concerned employees tuned in to hear if she would address the pressing issue on their minds: performance reviews. Sources inside the company confirm that a promotions process was recently delayed without explanation and that X’s sales team doesn’t expect to meet its revenue targets for the quarter. Given how the company formerly called Twitter has continued to struggle under Elon Musk’s ownership, employees have been bracing for more layoffs. One of Musk’s key lieutenants, The Boring Company CEO Steve Davis, has been reviewing finances at X’s headquarters in San Francisco over the past several weeks, according to multiple employees who requested anonymity to speak without the company’s permission. As one of them described Davis: “He’s the grim reaper who only shows up for bad things.”  A source at X told The Verge that there have been a handful of people laid off in recent days. Many noticed the sudden departure of Yaccarino’s right-hand man, Joe Benarroch. So, when a rare all-hands meeting with her landed on employee calendars last week, X’s roughly 1,500 remaining staffers anxiously waited to find out more. The meeting began with a montage of viral tweets, including one by infamous GameStop trader Keith Gill, followed by Yaccarino joining from an X conference room named “eXtraordinary.” She tried to drum up excitement about live events on the platform, such as the Super Bowl and March Madness, and urged employees to discuss Musk’s x.AI chatbot Grok with advertisers. She also emphasized that X’s focus on video has “definitely driving advertising” without elaborating. As the meeting continued, X’s head of HR, Walter Gilbert, told staff that X is planning to implement a broader and more robust promotion process that will include “doing lighter-weight check-ins throughout the year.” One source who watched the meeting quipped that a bulk of the submitted employee questions were “definitely about HR, promotions, raises/equity” and not addressed. Musk was noticeably absent despite him being in San Francisco along with Yaccarino. Instead, several other directors joined: Monique Pintarelli, head of advertising for the Americas, Nick Pickles, who leads policy, Kylie McRoberts, the company’s latest head of trust and safety, and Haofei Wang, director of engineering. While Yaccarino was light on specific data about the performance of the advertising business, Pintarelli told staff that X now has over “50% of our revenue attributed to performance objectives,” which she described “as a pretty big shift from where the business was over the last few years.” While this all-hands may not have given X employees many answers, Yaccarino did emphasize that the company will be conducting them once a quarter, adding that the team will “also be hearing quite soon from both Elon and I.” Alex Heath contributed reporting.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
22,Sean Hollister,How Asus is overhauling its customer support after Gamers Nexus investigation,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus,"Asus will now process RMA disputes over email, open a new warranty center in the US, address the ROG Ally’s SD card failures, and more after an investigation.",2024-06-14T20:32:07Z,"By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Asus’ reputation for customer support has been tarnished, and the company is now pledging a long list of concrete fixes to Gamers Nexus. Chief among them: if you’ve ever been denied a warranty repair or charged for a service that was unnecessary or should’ve been free, Asus wants to hear from you at a new email address. It claims those disputes will be processed by Asus’ own staff rather than outsourced customer support agents. And, after failing to even acknowledge the ROG Ally handheld’s SD card reader issues for over a year, the company will be finally be issuing a formal statement about the defect next week, Gamers Nexus is reporting. One month ago, GN revealed that Asus could in some instances charge customers for unwanted and unneeded repairs, among other issues. Following the company’s tone-deaf response to that investigation and additional pressure by the YouTube channel, Asus customer support higherups sat down face to face with GN this week.  Here’s the list of concrete promises that resulted from that sitdown, according to GN: ASUS now has a new inbox called “executivecare@asus.com” that they have created specifically to re-process prior RMAs that customers feel were unfairly classified, were misclassified, or charged for a service that should be free ASUS has published a timeline for improvements: June 14th, today, is the publication of this email and template. ASUS has promised us an email this month with other changes. ASUS has committed to refunds of service charges for unnecessary repairs which customers felt compelled to accept in order to have a warranted repair covered, such as unrelated or misclassified CID [Customer Induced Damage] ASUS has committed to refunding shipping charges in scenarios where a warranted repair was part of the RMA. For clarity, if a customer has both an out-of-warranty repair and an in-warranty repair in the same claim, shipping will be covered by ASUS ASUS has committed to refunding labor and taxes related to these aforementioned qualifying disputes ASUS has created a Task Force team to retroactively go back through a long history of customer surveys that were negative to try and fix the issues ASUS has removed the power from the repair centers to claim CID. Now, CID claims must go through ASUS’ team. This will remove some of the financial incentive to fail devices. There still is one, but now it won’t be motivated as much by speed ASUS is creating a new support center in the US. This will enable customers to choose between a repair of their board or a faster swap with a refurbished board. This solves an issue where refurbs were the only option in some scenarios previously After over a year of refusing to acknowledge the microSD card reader failures on the ROG Ally, ASUS will be posting a formal statement next week about the defect, resulting from this series ASUS will publish a more transparent repair report template in September of 2024 ASUS is changing the Advance RMA language to reduce emphasis on physical damage Also, here’s an email template you can use when emailing that executivecare@asus.com address, as provided by Asus itself: Your Name (as listed in your RMA):  RMA Number: Serial Number: RMA application country: Please describe your previous RMA dispute: Supporting Documents (e.g., charged invoice, quotation notification, photos): Additional Feedback (optional): Asus says it should respond to emails sent to that address within a week.  The company is also apologizing today for previous experiences you might have had with repairs. “We’re very sorry to anyone who has had a negative experience with our service team. We appreciate your feedback and giving us a chance to make amends.” Gamers Nexus says it’s not taking Asus at its word. “[W]e already have devices in their RMA centers under pseudonyms and plan to continue sampling them over the next 6-12 months so we can ensure these are permanent improvements,” writes editor-in-chief Steve Burke. Asus had previously laid out a handful of promised customer support improvements at this link (pdf).  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. Starting this fall, it appears Siri is going to be much more powerful. Whether this is good news or a harbinger of infinite technological frustration depends on how you feel about Siri, AI, virtual assistants, and the whole idea that your devices should be able to do stuff on your behalf. Either way, it seems virtually certain that at Apple’s WWDC event on Monday, we’re going to hear an awful lot about how Siri can make your life better. This year’s WWDC is actually an important one for Apple. CEO Tim Cook and others have been hinting that this is when Apple will reveal its grand plans for AI and end the notion that Apple is somehow behind Google, OpenAI, and the rest. What will it look like, though? Who knows! But it’s going to be AI, and it’s going to be everywhere. On this episode of The Vergecast, we preview what’s coming at WWDC and whether a heaping helping of AI is actually what Apple devices need. But before we get to that, we run through a laundry list of gadget news, from Intel’s new chips to Humane’s would-be buyers to Palmer Luckey’s new Game Boy. After that, it’s WWDC time.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Apple is gearing up to reveal a new AI system on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac next week at WWDC 2024 — and it will be called Apple Intelligence, according to a report from Bloomberg. In addition to providing new “beta” AI features across Apple’s platforms and apps, it will reportedly offer access to a new ChatGPT-like chatbot powered by OpenAI. Apple reportedly won’t focus on buzzy AI features like image or video generation and will instead focus on adding AI-powered summarizations, reply suggestions, and an AI overhaul for Siri that could give it more control over apps while chasing applications with “broad appeal.” Apple will use its “own technology and tools from OpenAI” to power its new AI features, according to Bloomberg. The company will reportedly use an algorithm to determine whether it can process a particular task on-device or if it will need to send the query to a cloud server. Previous reports have pointed out how Apple could focus on using its own M2  chips in data centers with a Secure Enclave to say that data processed remotely is as secure as it would be on-device. To address other potential security concerns, Bloomberg says Apple won’t build profiles based on user data and will also create reports to show their information isn’t getting sold or read. Microsoft recently revealed plans for Copilot Plus PCs with AI, including locally-stored screenshots for the searchable Recall feature, but has seen significant pushback, with one researcher calling the feature a “disaster” for security. Bloomberg reports users on iPad or Mac will need devices powered by an M1 chip or later, while the mobile requirements could be restricted to either an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the iPhone 16 devices launching this fall. As reported by Bloomberg, Apple won’t force users to use the new AI features and will make the capabilities opt in.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

The full version releases in fall 2024. Most significantly, macOS Sequoia will include Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that work across iPhone, iPad, and iOS. Among the features mentioned at WWDC: Writing Tools, a systemwide feature that can summarize text in emails and other apps and automatically draft replies to emails. Siri will now be able to act for you in apps and pull contextual information based on your personal information — all with voice commands, though you’ll also be able to type commands to Siri. Apple Intelligence will be available “this summer” with the Sequoia beta and requires an M1 or later processor. The Mac is also getting iPhone mirroring, which lets you access and control your iPhone from your Mac — including audio. You’ll be able to see and respond to phone notifications on the Mac and drag and drop text and images between the two devices. Finally, a non-touchscreen interface for your phone! When using mirroring, your iPhone stays locked and even in StandBy mode.  Apple also updated Safari with a bunch of new features, including Highlights, which uses machine learning to detect and summarize interesting information on the page, and additions to Reader mode, including summaries and tables of contents. It also has Viewer mode for on-page video content, with full playback control and support for Picture in Picture. The Keychain is getting a major update with a new Passwords app that can store many new types of account credentials, including Wi-Fi passwords, passkeys, verification codes, and shared passwords. It’ll be available on iOS, iPad, Mac, and visionOS and syncs to Windows using iCloud for Windows.  Apple is finally bringing automatic window tiling to MacOS, potentially sherlocking a bunch of utilities we never should have needed in the first place. Gaming isn’t off Apple’s radar, either. In addition to bringing the beloved Resident Evil series, including Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Biohazard, Control, and the next World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within, to macOS Sequoia, the company is releasing the second version of its Game Porting Toolkit. Apple says it’s added some highly requested features from game developers that will make it easier for them to port games to macOS, iPhone, and iPad. macOS Sequoia is compatible with all Macs running Apple Silicon, as well as some Intel-based ones. The list includes the 2017 iMac Pro, 2018 Mac Mini and MacBook Pro, and the 2019 Mac Pro and iMac, which coincides with the list of Intel-based Macs with the T2 security chip.

As slick and polished as macOS is, it can slow down over time, as you add file after file and program after program to your Apple system.

This isn’t just something to do if you want to clear out the clutter and fix persistent problems, though: resetting your Mac is also important when you’re selling it or passing it on. You don’t want anyone else poking around in your files or your web browsing data, and a reset stops that from happening. Resetting a Mac is fairly straightforward, but you do need to make sure everything on it is backed up before you get started (or at least everything you want to keep).

Even better, pick two: strictly speaking, you should always have a couple of copies of your most important data — otherwise, if one of your backups goes down for whatever reason, you’re left without a safety net. As a result, putting together some combination of cloud and local backups is usually a good idea. iCloud is now the default backup option for macOS, though you only get a measly 5GB of room for free, so you’ll probably have to upgrade to back up your entire Mac: pricing starts at $0.99 per month for 50GB of space, and it covers photos, videos, and files saved to key folders on macOS. You may have already configured iCloud when you first got your Mac and set it up. To get set up or make changes afterward: At the top of the screen, you can see how much of your iCloud storage space is being used and which types of files are using up most space.  macOS also offers Time Machine, which puts file backups on local storage drives connected via cables or over Wi-Fi: By default, hourly backups are kept for 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups for months before that. To make changes to the setup, click on the Time Machine icon on the menu bar (it looks like two clock hands with an arrow around them). Both iCloud and Time Machine should back up everything important on your Mac, including files saved to the desktop — just make sure you’re using the designated folders on your Mac for photos, videos, documents, and music. You don’t have to go with an Apple option for your backup. Tools like Google Drive and Dropbox work just like iCloud does, syncing specific folders to the web and updating changes as soon as they’re made.  These options should mean you’re well covered in terms of having your data backed up, but it’s worth doing a full audit before resetting your Mac. Can all your applications be installed again from the web? Are all your emails, messages, and local media libraries safely stored somewhere else? Are all the files in the folders they need to be in? Once you’ve verified that all your data is backed up somewhere and can be brought back after you’ve wiped your Mac, you’re ready to take the next step. Over the years, Apple has gradually refined the process of resetting your Mac, and thankfully, it’s now easier than it’s ever been: there’s even a friendly Erase Assistant tool to guide you through the process. Along the way, you’ll be shown a summary of the data you’re deleting and asked for your Apple ID password so you can be signed out of all the relevant apps and services (so this Mac is no longer tied to your Apple ID). The final screen you’ll see will be a dialog box with an Erase All Content & Settings button on it: once you click this, there’s no going back. Your Mac will be securely wiped and then restarted, and the setup screen will appear as if you were setting it up for the first time.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
27,David Pierce,Is Apple about to finally launch the real Siri?,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24172902/apple-siri-ai-2024-wwdc,"Since its launch in 2011, Siri has failed to live up to its potential as a virtual assistant. But thanks to AI, at WWDC 2024, Apple could show off a new and improved version.",2024-06-08T13:00:00Z,"By  David Pierce, editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech. Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired. When Apple first launched Siri in 2011 alongside the iPhone 4S, the company made a series of very compelling ads showing how you might use this newfangled voice assistant thing. In one, Zooey Deschanel asks her phone about delivering tomato soup; in another, John Malkovich asks for some existential life advice. There’s also one with Martin Scorsese shuffling his schedule from the back of a New York City taxi. They showed reminders, weather, alarms, and more. The point of the ads was that Siri was a useful, constant companion, one that could tackle whatever you needed. No apps or taps necessary. Just ask. Siri was a big deal for Apple. At the launch event for the 4S, Apple’s Phil Schiller said Siri was the best feature of the new device. “For decades, technologists have teased us with this dream that you’re going to be able to talk to technology and it’ll do things for us,” he said. “But it never comes true!” All we really want to do, he said, is talk to our device any way we want and get information and help. In a moment of classic Apple bravado, Schiller proclaimed Apple had solved it.  Apple had not solved it. In the 13 years since that initial launch, Siri has become, for most people, either a way to set timers or a useless feature to be avoided at all costs. Siri has been bad for a long time, long enough that it has seemed for years that Apple either forgot about it or simply chose to pretend it didn’t exist. But next week at WWDC, if the rumors and reports are true, we might be about to meet the real Siri for the first time — or at least something much closer to it. According to Bloomberg, The New York Times, and others, Apple is going to unveil a huge overhaul for the assistant, making Siri more reliable thanks to large language models but without much new functionality. Even that would be a win. But Apple also appears to be working on, and may be almost ready to launch, a version of Siri that will actually integrate inside of apps, meaning the assistant can take action on your device on your behalf. In theory, at least, anything you can do on your phone, Siri might soon be able to do for you.  This has obviously been the vision for Siri all along. You can even see it in those iPhone 4S commercials: these celebs are asking Siri for help, and Siri almost never actually finishes the job. It provides Deschanel with a list of restaurants that mention delivery but doesn’t offer to order anything or show her the menu. It tells Scorsese there’s traffic but doesn’t reroute him — and shouldn’t it already know he’s going to be late for his meeting? Siri tells Malkovich to be nice to people and read a good book but doesn’t offer any practical help. So far, using Siri is like having a virtual assistant whose only job is to Google stuff for you. Which is something! But it isn’t much. Siri’s inabilities have been all the more frustrating because everything it needs to be useful is right there on your phone. When I want pizza, why can’t Siri check my email for the receipt from the last time I ordered, open DoorDash, enter the same order, pay with one of the cards in my Apple Wallet, and be done with it? If I have a Scorsese-level busy day, Siri seems to be right there next to all my contacts, my Slack, my email, and everything else it needs to quickly move stuff around on my behalf. If Siri could take over my phone like one of those remote access tools that lets someone else move your computer’s cursor, it would be unstoppable. There are really two reasons Siri never lived up to its potential in this way. The first is the simple one: the underlying technology wasn’t good enough. If you’ve used Siri, you know how frequently it mishears names, misunderstands commands, and falls back to “here’s some stuff I found on the web” when all you wanted was to play a podcast. This is where large language models are unequivocally very exciting because we’ve seen how much better speech-to-text tools like Whisper are and how much more broadly these models can understand language. They’re not perfect, but they’re a huge improvement over what we’ve had before — which is why Amazon is also pivoting Alexa to LLMs and Google’s Assistant is being overrun by Gemini. The second reason Siri never quite worked is simply that neither Apple nor third-party developers ever figured out how it should work. How are you supposed to know what Siri can do or how to ask? How are developers supposed to integrate Siri? Even now, if you want to add a task to your to-do list app, Siri can’t just figure out which app you use. You have to say, Hey Siri, remind me to water the grass in Todoist, which is a weird sentence that makes no sense and, in my experience, fails half the time anyway. If you want to do a multistep action, your only option is to muck around in Shortcuts, which is a very powerful tool but falls just short of requiring you to write code. It’s too much for most people. AI might also give Apple a chance to end run the whole problem. Its researchers published a paper earlier this year detailing a system called Ferret-UI, which uses an AI model to understand small details of an onscreen image. The researchers even detail how an overall app using Siri might work: OpenAI’s GPT-4 does a good job of broadly understanding what an image is, and then Ferret is able to understand small regions and details. In practice, that might mean one system says, “This is the Ticketmaster app!” and the other says, “That right there is the buy button.”  We should be skeptical about whatever claims Apple makes for Siri. More than a decade ago, Schiller stood onstage and proclaimed that Apple had built a better voice assistant, and it hadn’t. The same might be true now, as the hype for AI continues to move a lot faster than the actual technology. Humane, Rabbit, Google, and others are all working on similar ideas — “agent” is the buzzword of the summer in the AI world — and no one has demonstrated that it’s ready yet. But if Apple has cracked something here, this could be the first time we ever get to see the real Siri — the Siri we were promised all those years ago. Maybe in the next commercial, Deschanel’s tomato soup will just magically appear at her house, and the Headspace app will fire up to bring Malkovich some inner peace. Maybe, finally, we’re going to get the Siri Apple always wanted to make.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
28,Jennifer Pattison Tuohy,Apple Home now supports robot vacuums,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24172054/apple-home-homekit-robot-vacuum-support-smart-locks-wwdc24,"At WWDC 2024, Apple announced robot vacuums are coming to the Home app with iOS 18, support for hands-free unlocking of smart locks, and new energy management features.",2024-06-10T18:54:38Z,"By  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News. Apple has announced that Apple Home will finally support robot vacuums with iOS 18. This was one of just a few updates to its smart home platform that Apple announced at WWDC 2024. The company also revealed that hands-free unlocking is coming to compatible smart door locks as well as the ability to share guest codes for access to your home (another thing we’ve been impatiently waiting for). Plus, there’s a new electricity usage feature coming to the Home app, although it’s limited to Pacific Gas & Electric users in California at launch. Apple said that the “Home app now supports the core functionality of robot vacuum cleaners, such as power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status.” The floor cleaning devices can also participate in automations and scenes and be activated with voice control using Siri, so you can tell it to go clean your kitchen. The feature most likely comes through Apple Home’s support of Matter, which added support for robot vacuums / mops in Matter 1.2. The Matter spec enables starting and stopping the robot, adjusting cleaning modes (dry vacuum, wet mopping), and receiving progress notifications and alerts.  However, Matter doesn’t support advanced features — like room mapping and keep-out zones (areas the robot shouldn’t go). This means that while Apple Home users should be able to add their robot directly to the Home app without using the manufacturer’s app or cloud, to access more advanced features, you’ll need to download that third-party app. Apple is bringing hands-free unlocking to compatible UWB-enabled locks with Home Key, allowing you to have the door unlock automatically when you’re six feet away. You’ll need to be carrying your iPhone or have your Apple Watch on to authenticate yourself. The feature will work with Apple Watch Series 6 and later and iPhone 11 and later.  Auto-unlocking was first developed by August and is now in most Yale locks, too. A number of other manufacturers have also introduced similar features. This should bring the ability to any Home Key-compatible lock that supports UWB. You’ll also be able to finally share access with guests to control locks, garage doors, and security systems as well as customize access based on time and other factors.  A new electricity usage page in the Home app’s Energy section will show your electricity usage through a connection to your utility. It will launch with a partnership with PG&E in California but hopefully expand to more utilities in the future.  Home energy management is an important ability of smart home devices, giving you tools to understand how your home uses energy and potentially allowing you to control it more efficiently. There are two main approaches: install devices that can monitor their energy usage, something the Apple Home app doesn’t currently support, or use an app that can communicate with your utility directly to get the information, which is what Apple is doing here.  Ultimately, a combination of the two is likely to be the best path. But what will really make the difference is a service that can do a lot of the management for you. Hopefully, this is Apple’s first step in that direction.  WWDC is traditionally where Apple has announced new features for its Apple Home smart home platform, giving developers time to integrate them into its devices ahead of the launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, and HomePod OS in the fall. The energy usage and robot vacuum features announced for Apple Home are listed as coming “later this year,” so they may not arrive with the first rollout of iOS 18. While the updates are often minor, we sometimes get things like an all-new Apple Home app. This year was a relatively minor update. I, for one, had hoped to see support for many more of the device types Matter supports, including TVs, washing machines, and fridges. I hope we don’t have to wait until the fall for those to arrive. Apple Home has undergone a significant shift in the last few years as Apple transitions its smart home platform from purely HomeKit to an architecture where HomeKit runs on Matter. Apple is a founding member of the new smart home standard and contributed HomeKit as the “foundation of this new standard.” For Apple Home users, Matter opens the platform to more device types than it has supported to date. Matter is an interoperability and communication standard that allows any Matter-enabled smart home device to work with any Matter platform, meaning all Matter devices should work with Apple Home. However, the platforms have to add support for the new device types, and Apple has been slow to do so. With robot vacuums now on the map, though, let’s hope there are more devices coming soon. Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be secure and private, easy to set up, and widely compatible. Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and others), Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol Thread and currently supports over 30 device types. These include lighting, thermostats, locks, refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, EV chargers, and more. A smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a Matter controller and controlled by them simultaneously, a feature called Multi-Admin.  Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
29,Jay Peters,The iPhone’s new Game Mode makes it faster and more responsive,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175466/iphone-game-mode-performance-frame-rate-optimization-wwdc-2024,At WWDC 2024 Apple announced a new Game Mode on iOS. Game Mode was previously introduced on macOS and  is intended to make for a smoother gaming experience.,2024-06-10T17:31:18Z,"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Apple is bringing Game Mode to iOS devices as part of iOS 18. The new feature was announced at WWDC 2024 on Monday. When Game Mode is on, your device will minimize background activity to maximize frame rates and will have improved responsiveness with AirPods and game controllers, according to Apple software chief Craig Federighi. Apple added a similar Game Mode to macOS last year as part of macOS Sonoma, though it requires that you have a Mac with Apple Silicon. The addition of Game Mode to iOS is just the latest step of Apple’s push to encourage people to play high-fidelity games on their iPhones. There’s a growing library of big games to play, like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil Village. Capcom also announced on Monday that Resident Evil 7 is coming to iOS (and iPads and Macs) next month and that the Resident Evil 2 remake is in development for Apple’s platforms.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

New AI features in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, visionOS 2, and more are coming.",2024-06-10T16:00:00Z,"Filed under: By  Umar Shakir, a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  Apple went all in on AI during WWDC 2024. During its annual keynote, the company showed off Apple Intelligence, its take on an AI system that spans the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Some of the biggest AI-powered updates include the ability to manage notifications, automatically draft responses to emails, and summarize text. Apple is also giving Siri a big AI upgrade that will give it more control over your apps and teased an upcoming ChatGPT integration. Other features enabled by Apple Intelligence, which is powered by both on-device processing and a “private” cloud computing system, include the ability to generate your own emoji and clean up the background of photos. But WWDC wasn’t all about AI. Apple also announced that it’s rolling out a more customizable iPhone homescreen in iOS 18, RCS support for Messages, a Calculator app for the iPad, updates to visionOS, and a way to mirror your iPhone on your Mac in macOS 15. Scroll down for all the news that came out of WWDC 2024. Jun 16 Wes Davis Siri may do more than make the edges of your iPhone a glowy rainbow when iOS 18 drops this fall. Apple Intelligence features won’t be out until 2025 for anyone not testing them in beta this year, but reports suggest that Siri itself will still get natural language updates and other key features before the year is out. For instance, users will be able to type to Siri without diving into accessibility settings, and it will be more conversational, understanding you even when you trip over your words, according to Mark Gurman in today’s Power On newsletter for Bloomberg.  Jun 16 Wes Davis As seen in MacRumors, iOS 18 beta testers can set a new Siri wake word using Vocal Shortcuts, a new accessibility feature. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Vocal Shortcuts > Set Up Vocal Shortcuts, then find and tap “Siri” to try it. It won’t work with HomePods. And your iPhone won’t acknowledge it unless you pause after saying the word. That’s good; otherwise, you learn just how frequently you say a word like “computer.” Jun 15 Wes Davis Apple’s long-included macOS Chess game has a new look in the first macOS Sequoia beta.  Shiny as it is, it’s missing things like the “Grass” board and the style picker for the pieces, 9to5Mac writes. Here’s the current version (using “Fur” pieces on the Grass board, of course) compared to a screenshot posted to Reddit of its coming replacement. Jun 15 Wes Davis The Siri face no longer exists, at least in the watchOS 11 developer beta, according to AppleInsider. If it’s gone in the release version this fall, that may be the first watchface ever retired, the story notes. The Siri face debuted with the Apple Watch series 3. Its big idea was that it would surface info as you need it, but new Smart Stack features may make it redundant. [9to5Mac] Jun 15 Emma Roth Apple will finally adopt RCS in iOS 18, effectively ending a yearslong fight for feature parity between iMessage and Android. But the announcement wasn’t a celebration — you could’ve blinked and missed it. Instead of showing how RCS will make things better, Apple softly announced support for the standard and focused on all the great features coming to iMessage users — not RCS ones. Apple didn’t go over how RCS adoption will finally let iPhone and Android users send each other high-resolution pictures and videos. It didn’t even say how RCS will enable support for cross-platform read receipts and typing indicators. Apple only highlighted the flashy features coming to iMessage, including ways to bold and italicize text, improvements to Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule a text. Jun 14 Jennifer Pattison Tuohy While Apple barely mentioned its smart home platform during its WWDC 2024 keynote this week, Apple Home users can still rejoice over an update discovered in the first iOS 18 beta: they’re getting the option to choose a “Preferred Home Hub.” This fixes the problem of your smart home “deciding” to run over Wi-Fi through a HomePod when there’s a perfectly good Apple TV using ethernet sitting right there. Eagle-eyed Redditors on the HomeKit subreddit spotted that, in the iOS 18 beta, there’s a new option to select your preferred Home hub instead of relying on Apple’s automatic selection, the current choice.  Jun 14 Jay Peters Password managers are essential. They keep track of your passwords, encourage better security practices, and generally help to manage your life across your devices. They’re the kind of feature that really should be built into every device — and Apple is massively expanding their reach with the launch of its new Passwords app, announced this week at WWDC. We have companies like 1Password and LastPass to thank for the popularity of today’s password managers. But an announcement like Apple’s puts them in a tough position: now that Apple has a free, built-in Passwords app, is there a future for the third-party apps that defined the space? Jun 14 Jennifer Pattison Tuohy Voice assistants hold so much promise, but in the decade-plus since Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa first wormed their ways into our lives, their most compelling use is still setting timers. Competition from Google’s Assistant (and if we’re being charitable, Samsung’s Bixby) failed to light the spark of innovation in this space, and in many ways, voice control has regressed. These assistants regularly misunderstand, mishear, and sometimes just don’t listen at all. They’re a far cry from the proactive, actually smart digital assistants they were originally pitched as. Enter generative AI: the technology voice assistants need to transform them from novel to necessary. This week at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced plans to infuse its long-neglected assistant with the emerging tech, providing Siri with two crucial skills: context and conversation. It’s the recipe for delivering on that original promise, or at least getting us much closer. Jun 13 Jay Peters Apple is introducing a way to use Apple Pay on non-Safari desktop web browsers, as reported by MacRumors, meaning that you’ll soon be able to use Apple’s payment service to buy things on desktop Chrome, Firefox, and even on Windows PCs. Apple showed how it works in a WWDC 2024 video for developers. If you’re using a desktop browser that isn’t Safari and you see an Apple Pay button, you’ll be able to click that button to bring up a special code you can scan with an iPhone running iOS 18. If you scan the code, you’ll then be prompted to complete the transaction on your iPhone. Jun 13 Victoria Song When I had covid, I was miserable, hacking up my lungs and confined to bed for several days with horrible brain fog. I don’t remember much from that time. I do, however, remember waking up bleary-eyed and feverish to an Apple Watch notification. It said I hadn’t made much progress on my rings. I should take a brisk 27-minute walk. “You can still do it,” it said. No, I could not. It wasn’t my fault I’d gotten sick, but my 85-day streak was broken anyway. Since then, I’ve had nasty shin splints, migraines, and multiple cross-country flights that make it hard to hit exercise goals — all excellent reasons to prioritize rest or build some extra flexibility into my schedule. Despite knowing better, I still felt disappointed whenever I listened to my body and prioritized rest over an arbitrary streak. Jun 12 Wes Davis Apple left out a lot of small updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote this year. It makes sense: the company had a lot to talk about, with a third of its presentation entirely devoted to new AI features. But that doesn’t make the features that didn’t get airtime any less worth talking about. From new bezel animations to better ways to manage widgets, there is plenty to discover in the first round of betas for iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and more. Here are some of our favorites so far: Jun 12 Jay Peters Cook was, unsurprisingly, very on message, but he did acknowledge that AI can have its flaws (which he has said before). Also, Cook talks about how the introduction of the Magic Mouse was an “incredible moment.” Jun 12 Jay Peters The new Apple Intelligence features coming to iOS 18 could be the most impressive integrations of AI software and consumer hardware to date. Apple’s AI tools will be able to take actions based on what they know about you, manage your notifications, and rewrite text. They’re the kinds of things that could make day-to-day use of your iPhone a lot better. But they won’t be available unless you have one of Apple’s latest and most expensive iPhone models. AI has quickly become the latest entry in the tech industry’s never ending desire to drive an upgrade cycle. A few years ago, every smartphone maker raced to 5G; more than a decade ago, the TV industry pushed for 3D TVs. Right now, every tech company clearly sees an opportunity with AI and is adding AI features confined to their latest and greatest devices as a result. But like the race to 5G, the mad rush toward AI is happening quickly and before the tech has been proven useful and its problems ironed out. Jun 11 Jennifer Pattison Tuohy Apple’s SharePlay is expanding to include speakers in your home. Soon, the HomePod, HomePod Mini, Apple TV, and any Bluetooth speaker will work with SharePlay and Apple Music, meaning you can share control of the music in your home with friends and family. Apple’s music service is also getting Music Haptics to allow those with hearing difficulties to experience music on iPhone. Both new features were announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference this week and should arrive with the tvOS and iOS updates this fall. Similar to the way SharePlay works in Apple CarPlay, this new SharePlay ability will let you give other people access to what’s playing on the speakers in your home. It’s the same concept as Spotify Jams, which lets multiple people contribute to and control a Spotify playlist. Jun 11 Jay Peters Apple is rebranding Apple accounts from Apple ID to (the arguably more straightforward) Apple Account. “With the releases of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and watchOS 11, Apple ID is renamed to Apple Account for a consistent sign-in experience across Apple services and devices, and relies on a user’s existing credentials,” Apple wrote in a Tuesday post on its Newsroom. The change doesn’t come as a total surprise, as it was rumored earlier this year. And even though Apple IDs have been around for a very long time, I’m personally fine with the change — “Apple Account” feels a lot clearer to me than “Apple ID.” Jun 11 Wes Davis Apple mentioned a few new features coming to the Vision Pro during its WWDC 2024 keynote presentation on Monday, such as the ability to turn your 2D photos into 3D ones and support for using the headset on trains. But the company glossed right over some of the most sorely needed features that it’s adding to visionOS — and those quieter changes make for a much more exciting update. After the update arrives this fall, you’ll be able to see a Magic Keyboard while you’re working in a virtual environment, use any Bluetooth mouse you want, and rearrange your homescreen icons — including putting iPad and iPhone apps where you want. These are all features that probably should have been there from the beginning, and they’ll improve the day-to-day experience of using the Vision Pro in meaningful ways. Jun 11 Emma Roth Even Apple CEO Tim Cook isn’t sure the company can fully stop AI hallucinations. In an interview with The Washington Post, Cook said he would “never claim” that its new Apple Intelligence system won’t generate false or misleading information with 100 percent confidence. “I think we have done everything that we know to do, including thinking very deeply about the readiness of the technology in the areas that we’re using it in,” Cook says. “So I am confident it will be very high quality. But I’d say in all honesty that’s short of 100 percent. I would never claim that it’s 100 percent.” Jun 11 David Pierce There were almost two different WWDCs this year. First, Apple did its classic platform whiparound, detailing all the new ways you can add stuff to your homescreen, share stuff with your friends, watch stuff on your TV, calculate stuff on your tablet, and more. In a normal year, that would have been the show. We would have talked about app icons for 45 minutes and gone home. The second act of WWDC was the Apple Intelligence show, in which Apple began to unveil its AI strategy. We saw a lot of features and ideas about how things might work — including a new and pretty exciting vision for Siri — but also got a sense of how Apple is planning to approach this potentially disruptive new category. We heard a lot of buzzwords! But also a lot of ideas.  Jun 11 Jay Peters Here’s how Apple describes the feature, per MacRumors: A rotating Wi-Fi address helps reduce tracking by changing your Wi-Fi address at various times. Tracking can happen when your address always appears the same to other devices and people using the same network as you. It’s coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. [MacRumors] Jun 10 Jennifer Pattison Tuohy Apple has a new Focus mode.  Reduce Interruptions uses the company’s new AI to review notifications and only show those that “might need immediate attention” — like a message telling you to pick your child up.  As someone who is inundated with nuisance notifications and has failed to make Apple’s non-smart Focus Modes work for me, I’m looking forward to this one. Jun 10 Jennifer Pattison Tuohy The words “ChatGPT · Check important info for mistakes” popped up under each demo of ChatGPT’s integration with Siri during Apple’s WWDC 2024 keynote. That Apple put something it doesn’t entirely trust on its devices feels like a huge move for the company. Although, it’s clearly keeping its options open — Craig Federighi teased that Google could be a partner, too. Jun 10 Emma Roth Apple will let you record and transcribe phone calls in iOS 18. The company announced the feature during its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday and says it will automatically tell call participants that they’re being recorded. The image shared by Apple shows a new recording option on the Phone app, which displays a soundwave, along with how long you’ve been recording. It then transcribes your call in the Notes app, where you can generate a summary using the new Apple Intelligence AI system. You’ll be able to record and transcribe audio from within the Notes app as well. Jun 10 David Pierce At a post-keynote live session, Apple’s Craig Federighi just explained how the company is thinking about integrating other AI models. ChatGPT is obviously the first big-name partner, but he mentioned eventually wanting to have domain-specific models. He also named another big player you might someday see in iOS: “We want to enable users ultimately to choose the models they want, maybe Google Gemini in the future. Nothing to announce right now.” Jun 10 Jay Peters Musk, who founded xAI, said that “if Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” and called that integration “an unacceptable security violation.” Apple and OpenAI have implemented precautions, with OpenAI saying that “requests are not stored by OpenAI.” Still, Musk might make visitors check their Apple devices.

See our ethics statement. If you’re still kicking along with the last-gen Beats Solo, now is a pretty good time to upgrade. It took Apple less than two weeks to discount the 2024 refresh of its alt brand’s on-ear headphones, the Beats Solo 4, to $149.95. And now, not even a month later, the price has dropped even further at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, where you can grab them for an all-time low of around $129.95 ($70 off). We find the Beats Solo 4 to be a very solid pair of headphones that are well equipped to handle most listening needs. You’re still getting Beats’ signature bass biased sound, which hasn’t changed much over the prior model. It really didn’t need to, though, and the headphones now support head tracking spatial audio when paired with an iPhone. Android users, meanwhile, get automatic device switching between Android, Chromebooks, and other devices. Apple peppered in more meaningful quality-of-life changes, too, such as lossless audio over USB-C or 3.5mm (which doesn’t degrade when the generous 50-hour battery dies), built-in Find My support, and added comfort. It’s still somewhat of a downer that Apple neglected to add water resistance and active noise cancellation, but it’s a little more forgivable at this price, and they can still naturally block a decent bit of sound with their slightly cushier ear cups. With lossless USB-C audio, 50-hour battery life, Find My, spatial audio, and more comfy ear cups, the Beats Solo 4 gained significant quality-of-life improvements over their eight-year-old predecessors. They still deliver that bass-rich Beats sound, too.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
32,Wes Davis,Apple’s next nebulous idea: smart home robots,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174800/apple-intelligence-ai-smart-home-robot-rumors,"Apple’s AI tools could also be a step toward building new smart home robots, but solving problems like stairs, and paperclips, could confound even the smartest AI bot.",2024-06-09T18:56:13Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Humanoid robots are one of those dreams that sometimes feel like we’re on the precipice of realizing. Boston Dynamics has its Atlas robot, and Tesla is pursuing robotics, while companies like Mercedes, Amazon, and BMW are or will be testing robots for industrial use. But those are all very expensive robots performing tasks in controlled environments. In the home, they might still be far off.  Enter Apple. Mark Gurman at Bloomberg has said its robotics projects are under the purview of former Google employee John Giannandrea, who has been in charge of Siri and, for a time, the Apple Car. With the car project canceled, the Vision Pro launched, and “Apple Intelligence” around the corner, is that the next big thing? According to his information, any humanoid Apple robot is at least a decade away. Still, simpler ideas may be closer — a smaller robot that might follow you around or another idea involving a large iPad display on a robotic arm that emotes along with the caller on the other end with head nods and the like. Many, if not most, homes are dens of robot-confounding chaos A mobile robot is tricky, though; what in the world would Apple do with a home robot that follows me around? Will it play music? Will it have wheels, or will it walk? Will I be expected to talk to Ajax or SiriGPT or whatever the company names its chatbot? Or, given Apple’s rumored OpenAI deal, some other chatbot? For that matter, what form will it take? Will it fly? Will it have wheels? Will it be a ball? Can I kick it? Its form factor will be at least as important as its smarts. Houses have stairs, furniture that sometimes moves, clothes that end up on the floor, pets that get in the way, and kids who leave their stuff everywhere. Doors that opened or closed just fine yesterday don’t do so today because it rained. A haphazard kitchen remodel 20 years ago might mean your refrigerator door slams into the corner of the wall by the stairs because why would you put the refrigerator space anywhere else, Dave? But I digress. Based on what little detail has trickled out, Apple’s robotics ideas seem to fit a trend of charming novelty bots we’ve seen lately. One recent example is Samsung’s Bot Handy concept, which looks like a robot vacuum with a stalk on top and a single articulating arm, meant to carry out tasks like picking up after you or sorting your dishes. There’s also the cute ball bot named Ballie that Samsung has shown off at a couple of CES shows. The latest iteration follows its humans and packs a projector that can be used for movies, video calls, or entertaining the family dog. Meanwhile, Amazon’s $1,600 home robot with a tablet for a face, Astro, is still available by invitation only. It is charming, in a late ’90s Compaq-computer-chic aesthetic sort of way, but it’s not clear that it’s functionally more useful than a few cheap wired cameras and an Echo Dot.  LG says its Q9 “AI Agent” is a roving smart home controller that can guess your mood and play music for you based on how it supposes you’re feeling. I’m very skeptical of all of that, but it has a handle, and I do love a piece of technology with a built-in handle.  I still want a sci-fi future filled with robotic home assistants that save us from the mundane tasks that keep us from the fun stuff we would rather do. But we don’t all live in the pristine, orderly abode featured in Samsung’s Ballie video or the videos Apple produces showing its hardware in personal spaces. Many normal homes are dens of robot-confounding chaos that tech companies will have a hard time accounting for when they create robots designed to follow us or autonomously carry out chores. There are other paths to take. Take the Ring Always Home Cam, which will be very noisy judging from the demo videos, but it could also be useful and even good. While putting aside the not insignificant privacy implications for a moment, it seems promising to me mostly because of the mobility and that it’s only designed to be a patrolling security camera.  That kind of focused functionality means it’s predictable, which is what makes single-purpose gizmos and doodads work. After some experimentation, my smart speakers are where they hear me consistently or are the most useful, and I can put my robot vacuums in the rooms I know I’ll keep clean enough that they won’t get trapped or break something (usually). The robot vacuums I have — the Eufy Robovac L35 and a Roomba j7 — do an okay job, but they sometimes need rescuing when they find my cat’s stringy toys or eat a paperclip (which are somehow always on the floor even though I never, ever actually need one or even know where we keep them). I have a kid, see, and preparing the way for them in other parts of the house is just adding more work to the mix. That’s fine for me because the two rooms in their charge are the ones that need vacuuming the most, so they’re still solving a problem, but it waves at the broader hurdles robotic products face.  And it’s not all that clear that AI can solve those problems. A New York Times opinion piece recently pointed out that despite all the hand-wringing about the tech over the last year and a half, generative AI hasn’t proven that it will be any better at making text, images, and music than the “mediocre vacuum robot that does a passable job.”  Given the generative AI boom and rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen, a cheerful, stationary smart display that obsequiously turns its screen to face me all the time seems at least vaguely within the company’s wheelhouse. Moving inside the house and interacting with objects is a trickier problem, but companies like Google and Toyota have seen success using generative AI training approaches for robots that “learn” how to do things like make breakfast or quickly sort items with little to no explicit programming.  It’ll be years, maybe even decades, before Apple or anyone else can bring us anything more than clumsy, half-useful robots that blunder through our homes, being weird, frustrating, or broken. Heck, phone companies haven’t even figured out how to make notifications anything but the bane of our collective existence. They’ve got their work cut out for them with homes like mine, where we’re just one busy week away from piles of clutter gathering like snowdrifts, ready to ruin some poor robot’s day.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. It’s a good time to be a late adopter, as the last-gen M2 iPad Pros are falling to record low prices on their way out the door, allowing you to save anywhere from $200 to $400. Apple’s M4-based iPad Pros may be the hot new tablets for 2024, with ultrathin builds and OLED displays, but 2022’s iPad Pros are still formidable slates for doing just about all necessary iPaddy things. The cheapest way into one of these M2 iPad Pros is the base 11-inch model with 128GB of storage, selling for $599 ($200 off) at Best Buy. Stepping up to the 256GB model runs $699 (also $200 off), and the beefy 512GB is $799 (saving $300). These discounts drop the 2022 11-inch iPad Pro down to the same price as the new 2024 iPad Air that just got the same M2 processor (because choosing an iPad must always be confusing as hell, apparently). However, opting for the older Pro over the new Air gets you a higher 120Hz refresh screen, Face ID, more cameras, and an extra GPU core. The 2022 iPad Pro touts a speedy M2 processor, a hover feature with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and support for Wi-Fi 6E. However, its design remains unchanged from the 2021 model.

Just like the 11-inch above, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro offers Face ID, an M2 processor, and 120Hz refresh. However, by picking the big boy, you also get a lovely Mini LED screen. It may not be quite as fancy or nice as the Tandem OLED in the new ultrathin M4 model, but it’s still an excellent panel that’s nice and bright. This makes the outgoing iPad Pro a much better buy than the new 13-inch iPad Air with the same processor that its discounted pricing is currently matching. Apple’s 2022 iPad Pro comes with a fast M2 processor and supports Wi-Fi 6E but otherwise shares the same design as its predecessor. The larger 12.9-inch model sports a higher-quality Mini LED panel than the 11-inch version.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

The long-awaited news came at WWDC 2024, the company’s annual developer conference.",2024-06-10T17:31:05Z,"By  Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. The long-awaited day is here: Apple has announced that its Messages app will support RCS in iOS 18. The new standard will replace SMS as the default communication protocol between Android and iOS devices. The move comes after years of taunting, cajoling, and finally, some regulatory scrutiny from the EU.  Unfortunately, we don’t know much else other than the fact that it’s coming in iOS 18. Apple’s website on the upcoming release does at least include one example of how RCS will look on iPhones. “RCS” appears in the text field to indicate a connection, but otherwise, it’s all pretty standard. Right now, when people on iOS and Android message each other, the service falls back to SMS — photos and videos are sent at a lower quality, messages are shortened, and importantly, conversations are not end-to-end encrypted like they are in iMessage. Messages from Android phones show up as green bubbles in iMessage chats, and chaos ensues. RCS, or Rich Communication Services, was developed as a replacement to SMS. RCS offers typing indicators and read receipts, allows you to send longer messages, and supports higher-quality images and videos. In other words, it’s a lot like iMessage. It’s become the standard messaging protocol on Android phones as US wireless carriers fully adopted it over the past five years, but Apple has been stubbornly withholding support. Starting with iOS 18, some of those iMessage-like features will finally be available in cross-platform chats. Pressure campaigns from Google and Samsung to adopt RCS probably aren’t what pushed Apple past the tipping point. The company announced in November — seemingly out of the blue — that it would add RCS support in the upcoming year. But the timing was probably no coincidence; Apple’s announcement was likely an effort to appease EU regulators.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

If you want to try out an early version of the new OS, we’ve got directions on how to install it on your iPhone or iPad. Before we get started, a word of warning: beta software — especially early developer beta — is inherently unfinished and may contain bugs. Think carefully before installing either on any device you depend on. They also may not include all of the features that will be in the final release. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install it, we suggest backing up your device’s data in case things go badly. The new iOS not only offers the usual plethora of cool new features but eventually will include Apple Intelligence, Apple’s new AI system that, according to the company, will be available this fall. Meanwhile, other new features include a more customizable homescreen and Control Center, the ability to require authorization for specific apps, a more expressive Messages app, and a heavily revamped Photos app. According to Apple, iOS 18 / iPadOS 18 will work on the following devices. (However, the beta of Apple Intelligence, when it’s available this fall, will only work in US English on the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the iPad and Mac with M1 and later.)

If you’re not among the lucky few going to Cupertino, California, to see WWDC 2024 live, you can stream the keynote at 1PM ET on YouTube, in the Apple TV app, or on Apple’s events page. The company is expected to reveal a swath of new AI features for its next big iOS update, including voice memo transcriptions, custom emoji generated on the fly, and Siri improvements that include the ability to control individual app features.  Plenty of these features will work on-device, but some will go to the cloud, for which Apple will reportedly use M2 Ultra-powered servers — which will almost certainly be part of the company’s privacy pitch. The company is also expected to announce a new deal with OpenAI to let ChatGPT have deeper access to iOS. AI will be most of the story, but Apple may tout other non-AI improvements that include UI updates for Apple Photos, the iOS and macOS settings apps, and Control Center. Messages could get a new feature that’s a little like its full-screen effects (think fireworks or confetti) but for individual words in a text message. Apple will reportedly announce visionOS 2.0 for the Vision Pro, with new features and native versions of first-party apps that until now have been available only as iPad apps.

The days are getting brighter, but with the current heatwave plaguing much of the US, how many of us can really go out and enjoy it? Luckily, Nanoleaf’s Skylight Smarter Kit is on sale for the first time, offering the rest of us a way to add some brightness to our day without melting to death. Normally $249.99, right now, you can buy the three-pack kit for $229.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Nanoleaf. Designed to mimic a skylight, Nanoleaf’s full-color LED ceiling lights can bring a bit of the sun into the comfort of your air-conditioned home. They feature exceptionally bright, tunable lights that radiate a whopping 4,200 lumens of brightness combined, while their modular design means you can build out different patterns or add more panels later for added flexibility. The lighting panels — only one of which needs to be wired — are also compatible with a number of platforms, including Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, with Nanoleaf promising Matter support soon. Even cooler, though, is that the lights offer hundreds of dynamic color effects and lighting scenes, so you can change the “weather” to “gentle rain” when the summer days make you long for relief from the heat. Nanoleaf’s AI-generated dynamic effects are impressive, too. For example, if you were to type in something like “tropical paradise,” the Magic Scene creator would generate effects designed to mimic the sea. As an added bonus, the lights can sync with ambient music and sound, making them great for setting the mood, especially at parties. Designed to mimic an actual skylight, Nanoleaf’s smart ceiling lights offer tunable LEDs as well as hundreds of lighting scenes — including AI-generated dynamic effects. If you want to beef up your home security ahead of your summer travels, right now, one of our favorite outdoor floodlight cameras is down to one of its best prices to date. Normally $89.99, you can currently buy the Blink Wired Floodlight Camera for just $59.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and The Home Depot. That’s the camera’s second-best price yet and only $10 shy of the all-time low we saw in January. For the price, Blink’s entry-level security camera has a lot going for it, including 1080p resolution and impressively bright 2,600-lumen lights that are easy to adjust. Unlike your typical outdoor security camera, it also has a loud 105dB siren that’s designed to scare away any potential intruders, allowing for greater peace of mind. You can control it via Amazon Alexa, too, and mount it either horizontally or vertically depending on your needs. Of course, there are tradeoffs. The audio isn’t great and you don’t get tunable lighting, for one, and motion detection is limited to 20 feet. Plus, you’ll have to pay a $3 monthly fee to take advantage of features like person detection and cloud recording (or purchase a $49.99 Blink Sync Module 2 for local storage). Still, if you just need a simple way to add some extra security to your home, the Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is a good investment at the current price. With 1080p video, 2,600 lumens, and a 105dB siren for under $100, this is a good budget buy if you don’t mind sacrificing better video quality and tunable lighting over other options.

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. We’ve seen two approaches to AI in mobile tech this year: “AI That’s Not Your Phone” and “AI That Does Random Stuff on Your Phone.” The “Not Your Phone” group includes devices like the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin, two small gadgets that sought to make AI more useful by building it into a smaller, simpler gadget. It hasn’t gone very well. Both devices came with big promises to help us get things done without looking at our phone screens. Neither delivered. Now it’s time for Apple, like Google and Microsoft before it, to announce a whole bunch of AI features at its annual developer conference today. But the current state of AI on our phones is, well, unimpressive. “AI Doing Random Stuff on Your Phone” includes Google’s generative AI tools like Magic Editor, Samsung Galaxy AI, and that kind of thing. Right now, it’s a bunch of party tricks that vary in quality from “kinda helpful” to “doesn’t really work” to “oh, dear GOD, no.” It’s definitely not the bold new future of mobile computing we’ve been promised. It’s Apple’s turn to make the case for AI as our daily assistant The company that has come the closest to showing us an AI feature that might actually save us some time is Microsoft. At its developer conference last month, the company announced Recall for its new Copilot Plus PCs — a feature that takes screenshots every few seconds of whatever you’re doing on your computer so you can use AI to search for it later. I could use that, like, yesterday. But maybe it’s a good thing Recall isn’t more widely available yet; it sounds like there are some serious security concerns. During its keynote today, it’ll be Apple’s turn to make the case for AI as our daily assistant — and the signals so far are encouraging. Some of the rumors sound like stuff we’ve heard before, like AI voice memo transcriptions and summaries, but the most recent reports point to features with “broad appeal.” Siri would be a sensible home for stuff like that, and all signs point to a big update for iOS’s virtual assistant. Most compelling of all, Siri might be able to do things on your phone for you. You know, the stuff virtual assistants have promised to do for the past decade. Apple has a real balancing act to pull off to make this a reality, though. The company reportedly doesn’t have a blockbuster LLM of its own ready to announce, so it’ll probably call in a ringer: OpenAI. But public trust in that company isn’t exactly at an all-time high, and Apple will have to square its emphasis on privacy with the need to hand off data to the cloud. It might have some clever privacy solutions on hand, but it seems likely that the AI era might push Apple to rely more on third parties than it has historically preferred to. As always, Apple comes to the table with a big advantage: control over both the software and hardware. In theory, that’s something that Google has with its Pixel phones, but there’s only so much it’s been able to do with Android since it needs to work for everyone else in the ecosystem, too. Google’s recent reorg suggests that it sees the advantage in hardware and software teams working closer together, but for better or worse, Apple has a big head start here. Even if new and improved Siri can only access Apple apps for you at first, that’s still a whole lot of apps that plenty of people use on a daily basis. One thing is clear: Apple, the company that is “late” to AI, finds itself with an opening in the field wide enough to drive a truck through.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  A YouTuber was arrested after posting a video showing two people in a helicopter shooting fireworks at a Lamborghini. On Thursday, the US Department of Justice charged Suk Min Choi — known as Alex Choi on YouTube — for allegedly breaking the law against having an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft. The now-deleted video, titled “Destroying a Lamborghini With Fireworks,” was posted on July 4th, 2023. Choi, who has more than 924,000 YouTube subscribers, is shown driving the Lamborghini as two women begin shooting fireworks in the direction of the car. Law enforcement officials believe Choi filmed the video at El Mirage, a dry lake bed in San Bernardino County, California. The Federal Aviation Administration began investigating the video in December, according to an affidavit filed with the Central District of California. The affidavit cites an email from what appears to be Choi’s account, saying he wants to record a video of an “attack helicopter shooting missiles (mortar style fireworks) at the car, while the car is trying to run away and dodge the missiles using flares (roman candle fireworks attached to the back of the car).” As noted in the affidavit, the federal government alleges that Choi didn’t obtain permits from the Bureau of Land Management or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives required to film the video. Choi was released on a $50,000 bond on Thursday, with his arraignment set for July 2nd. He faces up to 10 years in federal prison. In 2022, Choi filmed and posted a video of a rented Tesla performing a “jump” in San Francisco and smashing into two parked cars.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

A press release from Netflix takes the whole thing very seriously, quoting Kobayashi saying, “Retiring for me will only happen after I take him down one last time... Competing against Joey live on Netflix means fans all over the world can watch me knock him out.” Chestnut, meanwhile, says, “It’s time to give the people what they want!” The competition will have extra intrigue because Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayashi will both have to skip the annual July 4th Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest that made their rivalry famous. A six-time winner, Kobayashi was banned from the contest in 2010 over a contract dispute.

45,Gaby Del Valle,Fired SpaceX workers sue Elon Musk for sexual harassment and retaliation,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177095/spacex-elon-musk-sexual-harassment-lawsuit,"The lawsuit, filed in California state court, claims Musk fostered “a perversely sexist culture at SpaceX.”",2024-06-12T18:12:21Z,"By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. Eight former SpaceX engineers filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk on Wednesday alleging sexual harassment and retaliation. Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002, “knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community,” says the employees’ complaint, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg. The complaint — which cites many of Musk’s Twitter posts making sexually explicit jokes — claims that Musk fostered “a perversely sexist culture at SpaceX.” Several of the plaintiffs say they “experienced direct harassment that mimicked Musk’s posts.” According to the suit, senior engineers often used phallic language during technical meetings, referring to mechanical parts as “chodes” and “schlongs.” Engineers allegedly used sexual jokes as product names “It was also common for engineers to apply crude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name ‘Upskirt Camera’ was used for a camera on the first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage.” The complaint also cites a video “starring SpaceX’s upper management, including Vice President of Human Resources (HR) Brian Bjelde, President and CEO Gwynne Shotwell, and Elon Musk that mocks and makes light of sexual misconduct and banter.”  The former employees, who are also pursuing a National Labor Relations Board complaint against SpaceX, collaborated on an open letter in 2022 that raised concerns about Musk’s behavior and the broader company culture at SpaceX. The employees were subsequently fired — and their lawsuit alleges the order to terminate them came from Musk himself. Per Bloomberg, after a human resources official suggested SpaceX conduct an investigation, Musk replied, “I don’t care, fire them.” After the letter was published, Shotwell emailed two of the letter writers telling them to “stop flooding employees [sic] communications channels immediately,” the complaint claims. Shotwell later sent a companywide email “with the subject line ‘Please stay focused on the SpaceX mission,’ in which she called the Open Letter ‘overreaching activism’ and stated that ‘[w]e performed an investigation and have terminated a number of employees involved,’” according to the suit. The complaint targets both Musk and SpaceX. “Musk thinks he’s above the law. Our eight brave clients stood up to him and were fired for doing so. We look forward to holding Musk accountable for his actions at trial,” Laurie Burgess, an attorney representing the former engineers, said in a statement. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report that Musk had sexual relationships with two SpaceX employees, including a former intern he later hired onto his executive team. A third woman who spoke to the Journal said Musk asked her several times to have his children and complained about her work performance after she said no. The woman said she was also denied a raise.  Shotwell accused one of the women of having an affair with her husband, according to the Journal. After the woman reported this to HR, Shotwell reportedly “told the HR department at SpaceX that she wanted the woman removed from the office of the chief executive,” the Journal’s article says. In a statement to the Journal, Shotwell said the report paints “a completely misleading narrative” of SpaceX’s company culture. Some former SpaceX employees disagree. In 2021, after a former SpaceX employee published an essay detailing multiple instances in which she was groped by her male colleagues, five former employees claimed there was a culture of sexual harassment at the company. The employees said HR handled complaints poorly. In 2022, Business Insider reported that a flight attendant on Musk’s private jet claimed he exposed himself to her. SpaceX did not immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
46,Abigail Bassett,"Ionna, the EV charging company backed by seven automakers, is beginning to take shape",https://www.theverge.com/24176160/ionna-ev-charging-dc-fast-headquarters-network,Ionna is a joint venture between seven automakers aimed at solving the problems with EV charging in the US. The company is starting to build out its first stations.,2024-06-11T16:30:00Z,"By  Abigail Bassett Late last year, seven automakers — BMW, Honda, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis — announced plans for a joint venture to build easy-to-access public DC fast charging infrastructure in the US and Canada.  The resulting company, Ionna, announced today that its headquarters will be in Durham, North Carolina and feature what the company is calling a “Quarterback Lab,” designed to help each participating car company address charging issues following software updates, tackle customer issues closer to the source, and offer interoperability testing. It was a sign that the new venture was thinking critically about how to fix EV charging in the US.  The company also hinted at adding “new partners” to the Ionna consortium The company also hinted at adding “new partners” to the Ionna consortium, but it’s unclear whether those will be additional automakers, local and state governments, utilities, or retail partners as the company builds out its offerings  There will be a total of seven of these labs all around the country, and Ionna plans to have a few DC fast chargers up and running by the end of 2024, with additional plans for more than 30,000 chargers in dense urban areas, along highway corridors, and along “vacation routes,” according to the company.  The company has promised to bring 203 jobs to the Durham area as part of the $10.1 million dollar investment. The site beat out a location in Texas.  The leadership at Ionna says it’s rethinking the way that it tackles public fast charging, with a tighter focus on customer and driver needs. After all, charging has now become part of the product experience and one that is in dire need of attention from the automakers.  Ionna says it sees the process of electrification in four stages. The first was when the first EVs, like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Volt, hit the market in the early aughts. The second was when companies like Tesla and EVGo began building out charging networks, both closed and open. The third, interestingly enough, they see as post-covid when automakers reported a softening of demand for EVs, and early adopters began to have issues with the reliability of the public charging infrastructure. IONNA says we’re currently in the fourth stage, where a robust network of chargers and amenities is necessary in order to fully electrify transportation.  That network will feature things like retail offerings, food, restrooms, and covered charging for EVs, an experience that will make charging more analogous to what most Americans are used to at more than 100,000 gas stations across the country.    Ionna has spun up a team relatively quickly, and most employees, including the top brass, started just a few months ago. Most of the top leadership has a background in EV charging, automotive, and energy and infrastructure, and the company says it’s looking both inside and out for talent.  Ionna CEO Seth Cutler is no stranger to the EV charging industry Ionna CEO Seth Cutler is no stranger to the EV charging industry. He started his career at GE Energy, where he worked on EV charging infrastructure during the days when the Nissan Leaf and the Chevy Volt were the only electrified vehicles on the market. From there, he joined Electrify America, where he held the title of chief engineer and worked on product development and deployment of EA’s ultra-fast DC charging stations. He then joined EV Connect, where he was COO, and in February of this year, he became CEO at IONNA.    Chief product officer Ricardo Stamatti hails from the OEM side of the industry and is a founding member of Ionna. Prior to joining the company, he spent 10 years working through the layers of business units at Stellantis and spent a year as SVP and global head of Stellantis Energy. Other members of the C-suite include former BP CFO Derek Rush and Shankar Muthukumar, who comes from Mortenson, a builder, developer and provider of energy and engineering services.  When it first launched, Ionna said it would leverage federal funding to build out the network. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 allocated $7.5 billion for EV charging, $5 billion of which for building a “backbone” of high-speed chargers along America’s major roads and interstates through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. But NEVI has come under political fire recently, as only seven chargers have been deployed nationwide. NEVI funds are administered by the states, and critics point to that as one of the many factors delaying the rollout. Plans for Ionna to leverage NEVI funds have changed slightly, according to the company.  NEVI has come under political fire recently The billions of federal dollars available through the NEVI program “will eventually find their way into charge points on the ground,” Stamatti told The Verge via email. “We are confident the process will adjust accordingly and be helped by the improved quality of new grant seekers stepping in like Ionna. Ionna will be there when that happens, still deploying to that 30K+ goal, but we are also fully funded to go ahead and deploy now without having to depend on NEVI.”  While Ionna leadership says it’s not concerned about the potential for upheaval in the November elections that could put a significant damper on EV adoption and infrastructure, the company is keeping a close eye on things. It says it’s fully committed to the future of EV adoption and building out infrastructure that offers amenities that EV drivers want, alongside a robust fast charging network that meets customers where they need it most.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.  X is rolling out private likes as soon as today, according to a source at the company. That means what users like on the platform will be hidden by default, which is already an option for X’s Premium subscribers. Following the publication of this story, X owner Elon Musk reshared a screenshot of it, saying it’s “important to allow people to like posts without getting attacked for doing so!” A few weeks ago, X’s director of engineering, Haofei Wang, said the upcoming change is meant to protect users’ public image — because “many people feel discouraged” to like “edgy” content. The Likes tab on user profiles will be gone. Users will still be able to see who liked their posts and the like count for all posts, but they will not see the people who liked someone else’s post, according to X senior software engineer Enrique Barragan. (He also hinted at the launch today in a post.) “Soon you’ll be able to like without worrying who might see it,” Wang said last month. Late last year, Musk told the platform’s engineers that he wanted to get rid of the tweet action buttons altogether and instead place a stronger emphasis on post views (also called “impressions”). Musk’s goal was to remove the section that contained the like and repost buttons entirely because Musk believed likes weren’t important, a source told me at the time. “Social media in general is shifting away from like counts, so this makes sense,” the source said. “Part of me thinks [Musk] just wants to disassociate from Twitter more and more.” Update, June 11th: Added Elon Musk’s confirmation of The Verge’s reporting.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
48,Wes Davis,Netgear’s new Orbi mesh and Nighthawk routers are a cheaper way into Wi-Fi 7,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175947/netgear-orbi-mesh-nighthawk-wi-fi-7-router,"Netgear’s latest Orbi 770 mesh router system and Nighthawk RS300 router aren’t quite as fancy as their predecessors, but they’re a lot more affordable.",2024-06-11T13:59:42Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Netgear announced two new Wi-Fi 7 routers today: the Nighthawk RS300 and the Orbi 770. Both routers will come with 2.5Gbps ports and the benefits of Wi-Fi 7, such as 320Mhz channels that can potentially double wireless bandwidth for compatible hardware, but with lower prices this time around. The Orbi 770 router has four 2.5Gbps ports: one to connect to your modem for internet access and three to distribute that to any devices you want to wire up. The satellite mesh nodes each have two 2.5Gbps ports, too, letting you connect more devices to those or wire them straight to the main one. That compares to its more expensive predecessor, the Orbi 970, which has two 10Gbps ports and three 2.5Gbps ports. Netgear also says the Orbi 970 offers up to 27Gbps total bandwidth versus the Orbi 770’s 11Gbps thanks to an extra wireless band, but that won’t speed up your experience on any one device. To get the benefit of the 320MHz channels, you’ll need a phone, laptop, or other device with Wi-Fi 7 capability connected to the 6GHz band. The 5GHz band also gets a broader 240MHz spectrum — which, again, you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7 device to take advantage of.  The Orbi 770 goes for $999.99 for a three-pack, which may seem pricey (because it is) but is easier to swallow than the whopping $1,699.99 per three-pack that Netgear asks for the Orbi 970. The big benefit for these routers, as with most mesh Wi-Fi 7 routers, lies in Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a new feature in the Wi-Fi 7 standard that allows for simultaneous connections on two bands and, therefore, a faster, more stable connection. While none of your pre-Wi-Fi 7 devices can take direct advantage of MLO, the Orbi and its satellites can connect to each other this way. That means your mesh network should be less prone to congestion on a single band, and if one band goes down, you still have the other one to work with. The Nighthawk RS300 is likewise a tri-band router, with similar specs to the primary Orbi router but with a couple of key differences. The 6GHz band will still support 320MHz channel bandwidth, but the 5GHz is limited to 160MHz. (That’s still the fastest you can expect on any non-Wi-Fi 7 device, though.)  On the back, you’ll find one 2.5Gbps ethernet port for connecting to your modem, plus three more ethernet ports (two 2.5Gbps, one gigabit) for sending wired internet to your devices. It also has a USB 3.0 port if you want to connect something like a storage drive to it. Netgear says it’s good for about 2,500 square feet of coverage (though that will always depend on where you put it and what’s in your home) and supports up to 100 devices. The Orbi 770 will be $999.99 for a three-pack and $699.99 for a two-pack, while the Nighthawk RS300 is $329.99. They’re available for preorder now on Netgear’s site but will come to other retailers later on, according to the company.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Apple’s new “Apple Intelligence” AI features will let you make your own custom emoji and images, the company announced at WWDC 2024. The custom emoji are called “Genmoji,” and they look like a lot of fun. In one example, during Monday’s keynote, Apple showed how the prompt “smiley relaxing wearing cucumbers” generates a yellow smiley face emoji with cucumbers over its eyes. If you don’t like the initial emoji that Apple makes, you can swipe to pick from a few different options. The creation of official emoji is a pretty big process, so it’s nice that Apple is offering a way for users to create their own on the fly. (Google also offers a tool for users to create emoji with its Emoji Kitchen.)  There’s also a new “Image Playground” that lets you create images directly within different apps or from the Image Playground app. The examples Apple showed are all pretty cartoony, which could be a way to prevent people from making realistic AI-generated images like the swagged-out pope.

She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.  Apple is partnering with OpenAI to put ChatGPT into Siri, the company announced at its WWDC 2024 keynote on Monday. ChatGPT will be available for free in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year without an account, and Apple says that user queries won’t be logged. The popular chatbot will also be integrated into Apple’s systemwide writing tools. In addition, paid ChatGPT subscribers will be able to link their accounts to access premium features from OpenAI within Apple’s operating systems. As OpenAI and Apple explain, “Apple users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.” The long-awaited partnership emerges as Apple strives to integrate AI features that rival those of other big tech companies. Apple had been in discussions with both Google and OpenAI to incorporate their AI technology into its operating systems. Ultimately, it was OpenAI that secured the deal. “We’re excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement shared with The Verge. “Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI’s mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone. Together with Apple, we’re making it easier for people to benefit from what AI can offer.”  A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment further on deal terms. There has been speculation that the recent launch of OpenAI’s GPT-4o — which contains a voice assistant criticized for sounding uncannily like Scarlett Johansson in the movie Her — was intended to showcase how OpenAI’s technology could enhance Siri. Today, Apple confirmed that GPT-4o will be the model powering ChatGPT in Apple devices when iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia are made available later this year.  Alongside its OpenAI partnership, Apple announced a litany of its own new AI features under what it is calling Apple Intelligence.

The company reportedly plans to infuse its operating systems with AI features, debut chatbot features in partnership with OpenAI, and generally show that it hasn’t fallen behind Google, Microsoft, and the rest of the tech world when it comes to the year’s hottest tech. Apple was early to the digital assistant game with the launch of Siri in 2011. But the tech has languished since then — and even the products that have surpassed Siri, like Amazon’s Alexa, seem to have plateaued. The rise of AI should offer Apple another shot at building a “do anything for you” assistant, and rumors are that we’ll see the foundations of that laid at this year’s developer event. The big AI news will come on top of the regular batch of WWDC updates: new versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and more.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote has come to a close — and the company had a whole lot to share. We got our first look at the AI features coming to Apple’s devices and some major updates across the company’s operating systems. If you missed out on watching the keynote live, we’ve gathered all the biggest announcements that you can check out below. With almost all of big tech getting in on the AI boom, it’s no surprise that Apple is launching an AI system of its own. Apple Intelligence is the company’s new personal intelligence system “that puts powerful generative models right at the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.” That enables a ton of new capabilities across Apple’s native apps, such as the ability to generate images or summarize text. Apple Intelligence comes with a big emphasis on security, as the system will automatically decide whether it needs to use on-device processing or contact Apple’s private cloud computing server to fulfill your request. The system will be available for free and on the iPhone 15 Pro as well as on iPads and Macs with an M1 chip and later. Apple’s big push into AI also includes Siri. The upgraded voice assistant will now be integrated more deeply into the iPhone, appearing as a pulsating light on the edge of your device. It will give you more control over your apps, allowing you to ask the voice assistant to find information inside a particular email or even surface a photo of one of your friends. Apple is relying on LLMs to help Siri better understand what you say and keep track of follow-up requests and questions. Siri’s big AI upgrade also includes an integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. With the new integration, Siri will automatically determine whether a query would be better suited for ChatGPT. It will then ask for your permission before sending its request to ChatGPT. You’ll be able to use ChatGPT through Siri for free and without an account. Apple is rolling out a bunch of new AI features across its apps in iOS 18, including a way to summarize emails and generate responses. The company showed off its new Genmoji feature, letting you create custom emoji based on a text prompt, along with a new AI image generator called Image Playground.  Apple is bringing AI to the Photos app, too, giving you the ability to search for photos using natural language. You can also clean up objects in the background of your pictures, similar to Google’s Magic Eraser. Additionally, Apple is adding AI-powered transcriptions and summaries to Notes and the Phone apps. Aside from all the AI, Apple is introducing a new and more customizable Control Center in iOS 18. It’s also launching a way to freely place app icons on your homescreen. The company will also let you lock certain apps with the coming update, preventing other people from using them when you hand them your phone. Other major changes include a Photos app redesign and a new Game Mode for iPhone that minimizes background activity to optimize gameplay. After announcing support for RCS last year, Apple confirmed that it’s arriving with iOS 18. It didn’t expand on any other details beyond that, though. iMessage is getting some other upgrades, too, including the ability to schedule texts and support for SMS messaging via satellite. Apple is also rolling out colorful Tapback options and will let you bold, underline, and italicize text. Apple TV Plus is getting a new feature that will let you swipe down on your remote to show the actors and their characters in the movie or TV show that you’re watching. You can also find out the current song that’s playing and add it to your Apple Music playlist. Apple TV Plus will automatically show subtitles when you mute a show and will support 21:9 projectors. As rumored last week, Apple has revealed a new Passwords app that will let you keep track of your login details across different devices. The app will let you generate and store passwords similar to other password managers like LastPass and 1Password. Passwords will be available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and even Windows. The iPad is finally getting a Calculator app more than a decade after its release. It comes with a new feature called Math Notes, which lets you use the Apple Pencil to write equations on your iPad and have the app solve it for you. Apple is launching a Smart Script feature as well, which uses machine learning to improve the appearance of your handwriting and spell-check your notes. Apple’s next macOS update will let you mirror your iPhone on your Mac. You’ll be able to interact with your iPhone directly from your Mac, letting you view notifications and hear the audio playing from your mobile device. There’s also a new Highlights feature coming to Safari, which uses machine learning to pick out interesting parts of a page. There are a ton of new features coming to watchOS 11, too, including a new capability that automatically adds widgets based on when you need them. Apple is launching a new Vitals app that will let you “explore your most important health metrics with just a glance” as well as new cycle tracking features, Live Activities, and support for Check In, allowing your loved ones to track you during your workout. Apple has announced visionOS 2, its first major update for the operating system. One of the new features coming to the Vision Pro uses machine learning to bring depth to an existing photo. The update will also introduce support for an ultrawide virtual Mac display, more intuitive gestures, and support for travel mode on trains. Apple is also planning to bring the Vision Pro to more countries, including China, Singapore, Australia, Canada, France, and the UK. Apple is launching Siri Interactions in its next AirPods Pro software update, letting you shake your head yes or no to respond to Siri’s announcements. The AirPods Pro are also getting Voice Isolation to enhance voice quality and reduce background noise.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
53,Emma Roth,Apple announced RCS with a whimper when it should have been a bang,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24178470/apple-rcs-support-wwdc-announcement-android-imessage,"Apple announced that it will adopt RCS in iOS 18, but it barely even acknowledged the change during its keynote at WWDC 2024.",2024-06-15T13:00:00Z,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Apple will finally adopt RCS in iOS 18, effectively ending a yearslong fight for feature parity between iMessage and Android. But the announcement wasn’t a celebration — you could’ve blinked and missed it. Instead of showing how RCS will make things better, Apple softly announced support for the standard and focused on all the great features coming to iMessage users — not RCS ones. Apple didn’t go over how RCS adoption will finally let iPhone and Android users send each other high-resolution pictures and videos. It didn’t even say how RCS will enable support for cross-platform read receipts and typing indicators. Apple only highlighted the flashy features coming to iMessage, including ways to bold and italicize text, improvements to Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule a text. These are all great changes, but iPhone users won’t be able to use these features when chatting with someone on Android. And we don’t even know how the emoji created with Genmoji, Apple’s new AI emoji creation tool, will appear in texts sent to users on Android, either. The company buried RCS on its iOS 18 preview page, too. It doesn’t even refer to Android users by name: “RCS (Rich Communication Services) messages bring richer media and delivery and read receipts for those who don’t use iMessage.” The included image shows an RCS chat on the iPhone, which has the green bubbles indicating the person you’re texting isn’t on an iPhone. Apple first confirmed RCS support was coming last year. “This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users,” Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy said in a statement to The Verge at the time. But it wasn’t necessarily a magnanimous move. Apple was largely forced to support RCS in response to the mounting pressure from global regulators and competing companies. That may help explain the somewhat disgruntled approach to announcing its rollout in iOS 18. But Apple’s adoption of RCS has been years in the making. Every major carrier already made the switch to RCS. Apple was the only holdout, and regulators, combined with some bad press (remember when Tim Cook told a guy to buy his mom an iPhone?), made it increasingly necessary for the company to address the issue.” The fact that Apple skipped over RCS during its keynote makes it seem like Apple didn’t think it was worthy enough of showing off — which is goofy. The whole population of Android users, including myself, has been stuck getting photos and videos from iPhone users that you need a magnifying glass to make out (while also trying to convince them to download a third-party messenger that actually supports high-res media).  This is a massive improvement for both Android and iPhone users! It’s just too bad that the long-awaited unification of the iPhone and Android’s messaging systems was drowned out by unsettling AI-generated emoji and jiggling iMessage bubbles. Even without Apple’s acknowledgment, I’m just stoked that I’ll finally be able to exchange photos and videos from the 21st century with my iPhone-wielding friends and family members for once.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
54,Wes Davis,Nintendo’s first US commercial might be this 1980 ad,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24179080/nintendo-first-us-commercial-game-and-watch-toss-up-mego,A newly restored commercial may have been the first in the US to show a Nintendo product: a Game & Watch game that was licensed by a company named Mego.,2024-06-15T14:57:43Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Nintendo is a gaming juggernaut today, but it wasn’t really on anyone’s radar in the United States in 1980. And what was possibly the first US commercial for hardware produced by the company — a handheld called Toss-Up, from its “Game & Watch” series — certainly didn’t help, as a newly-restored copy shows. That’s because there’s no mention of Nintendo at all, or even Game & Watch. Game & Watch games were simplistic standalone handheld LCD games not unlike the cheap licensed Tiger Electronics games seemingly every kid had in the 1990s. And in the US, those games were initially licensed to a company called Mego (pronounced “mee-go”), and sold as a series called “Time-Out” instead, according to The Video Game History Foundation in a blog post Time Extension spotted.  The ad was dated June 25th, 1980 — only “a couple of months after Nintendo of America was incorporated,” Gaming historian Chris Kohler, who found the 16mm reel containing the ad on eBay, told the foundation. The hardware was still apparently embossed with a Nintendo logo on the back. Kohler lent the reel to the foundation, which turned to a company called Movette Film Transfer to digitize the film. It had to be restored because its dyes had faded significantly, leaving it with a magenta hue that will be familiar to anyone that’s seen obscure, unrestored movie prints. (I saw plenty of these in Austin, Texas at Alamo Drafthouse’s once-free-at-midnight “Weird Wednesday” exploitation films series.) The foundation pointed to this “potato quality” version of the commercial that was uploaded to YouTube six years ago to illustrate the differences: The commercial entreats mostly older, trendy youths (except for the goofy nerdy one because ha, ha, nerds) to enjoy an “electronic sport” when they can’t do real ones. You know, like when you’ve got fallen arches or tennis elbow, or you’re entirely wrapped in a full-body cast. That’s pretty different from Nintendo’s own commercials a few years later! Those tended to focus on kids and families and certainly didn’t have close-ups of butts in skin-tight shorts. Like this one:  The Game & Watch games also came in other form factors besides the one Nintendo resurrected for its standalone collectible versions of the NES Super Mario Bros. and Legend of Zelda games a few years ago. Like this dual-screen one: The company has referenced those designs in its other handhelds over the years. That one looks a whole lot like the Nintendo DS Lite, for instance. And the Nintendo 20th anniversary edition of the Game Boy Micro bore a strong resemblance to the gold and red design used by Toss-Up.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  Artifact is dead, long live Yahoo’s version of Artifact. The architecture behind Artifact, the news aggregation app built by Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, will live on inside the body of a brand-new Yahoo News app. Available to download today on iOS and Android, the new Yahoo News app brings an AI-powered personalized news feed for users based on their interests, while a feature called Key Takeaways can give a bullet summary of a news article when a reader is feeling TL;DR. Other features of the Yahoo News app include Top Stories, which picks up on trending stories for users to read and will soon include key takeaway summaries. You can block stories with undesired keywords as well as filter out certain publishers to your preference. And just like Artifact, Yahoo News also lets you flag content like clickbait-y headlines, then lets AI write something better. Yahoo purchased Artifact in April for an undisclosed amount, saving it from total demise. Artifact had sort of lost itself in the final stretch of its life after it had tried making it into a Twitter-like social media platform — although its original goal was to be like a “TikTok for Text.” Yahoo hasn’t said it’s bringing all of the social features of Artifact back, but the new app allows you to share article excerpts with your friends. It also has a gamified “streak” feature and badges you can show to others for being a heavy reader. Yahoo is also taking some of what it’s building in the News app to the Yahoo News online homepage.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Qudi Mask 2 could let privacy seekers who still want to be social have their cake and eat it, too. It’s a wearable digital avatar that hides a user’s real face behind an LED display and can automatically trigger a handful of emotive — but somehow also emotionally empty — expressions using head tracking and a mic. LED face masks aren’t a new idea — you’ve probably seen teenagers running around with them on Halloween — but the Qudi Mask 2 does more than just cycle through a preloaded collection of pixelated faces and colorful animations. Its faces can automatically change their expressions by reacting to what the wearer is doing. The sound of their voice will cause the animated mouth to move in real time so it appears like it’s talking, while the wearer nodding, shaking, or tilting their head will produce a yes, no, or confused expression, complete with a raised eyebrow. A simple nod, shake, or head tilt is usually enough to convey those expressions on their own without an accompanying LED light show, but the Qudi Mask 2’s creators are seemingly trying to elevate their product past another Amazon impulse purchase. The Qudi (which is apparently pronounced similar to “cootie,” according to this promotional video) Mask 2 is an upgrade from a previous version that looked more like a paintball mask bedazzled with glowing LEDs. Version two appears to be more streamlined and purpose-built as a wearable digital avatar, and according to its creators, is capable of displaying more than 30 additional emotions and “millions of faces” using app-based customizations. Three versions of the Qudi Mask 2 are planned: a cute Kawaii option; a cartoony Robot; and one called XX’s featuring abstract glyphs for eyes. A basic grid of color-changing LEDs could easily replicate all three of these designs, but the use of what appears to be segmented displays, similar to the digital clocks of yesteryear, will necessitate consumers having to make a choice. As with most expensive gadgets, there will also be cases available for the Qudi Mask 2, but they’re less about protecting the mask and more about changing the appearance of the wearer. If you’re not opting for the alien option, which looks suspiciously like a popular Scottish cartoon ogre, you’re throwing your money away. The creators of the Qudi Mask 2 have once again opted for a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to help bring version two of their mask to consumers. There’s always a risk when backing any crowdfunded product, even one that’s already fully funded, but early backers of the Qudi Mask 2 can get one discounted to $129. If you’d rather wait until after the Kickstarter is over, the full retail pricing will be closer to $199. That is unquestionably expensive when you can get something similar on Amazon for $36 that boasts over eight hours of battery life. The Qudi Mask 2 musters just three hours on a full charge. It feels like the digital equivalent of the classic mustache and glasses disguise, which doesn’t require you to carry an extra battery.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Voice assistants hold so much promise, but in the decade-plus since Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa first wormed their ways into our lives, their most compelling use is still setting timers. Competition from Google’s Assistant (and if we’re being charitable, Samsung’s Bixby) failed to light the spark of innovation in this space, and in many ways, voice control has regressed. These assistants regularly misunderstand, mishear, and sometimes just don’t listen at all. They’re a far cry from the proactive, actually smart digital assistants they were originally pitched as. Enter generative AI: the technology voice assistants need to transform them from novel to necessary. This week at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced plans to infuse its long-neglected assistant with the emerging tech, providing Siri with two crucial skills: context and conversation. It’s the recipe for delivering on that original promise, or at least getting us much closer. Apple says its Apple Intelligence will bring Siri “all-new superpowers” gleaned from improved language understanding, an awareness of personal context, and the ability to take action across apps on your phone.  Where the current Siri needs explicit instructions on what to do and how to do it, Apple promises that this new version will let you say something like, “Siri, what time does Mom’s flight land?” and the assistant will know to look through your Mail and Messages and pull out the information. You could then say, “How long will it take me to get there?” and it should know you mean the airport and pull up a route and ETA via Maps.  These seemingly minor improvements address the fundamental issues of voice assistants You also won’t have to phrase commands precisely. Instead of saying, “Siri, set a timer for 10 minutes,” you should be able to bumble through with a phrase like, “Siri, set an alarm for — oh, wait, no, set a timer for 10 minutes. Actually, make that 5,” and the assistant will get it right. These seemingly minor improvements address some of the fundamental issues of voice assistants — not understanding enough about you and requiring you to speak in unnaturally precise ways to get them to do anything — that turned these promising pieces of technology into barely more than glorified alarm clocks.  Siri, Alexa, et al. are already artificially intelligent voice assistants: machines that mimic human-like intelligence through a combination of command and response programming and machine learning. But with the power of generative AI and LLMs, voice assistants could have the ability to generate a response based on what they’ve learned, rather than just reacting with existing knowledge.  This should provide the tools to create that more conversational, smarter voice assistant — one that promises to be much more useful than those we have today. But all we’ve seen to date are demos of this potential, none of this exists in real life yet. Making voice assistants smarter is not as simple as giving Siri and Alexa a ChatGPT-style lobotomy This is because making a superintelligent voice assistant is a huge challenge with equally huge potential ramifications if it gets it wrong. It’s also not as simple as giving Siri and Alexa a ChatGPT-style lobotomy.  Voice assistants, especially ones connected to devices and services in our phones and homes, are a different beast than a chatbot in a browser. They have the ability to take action in the real world: doing things like controlling our thermostats and lights and sending emails and messages. This is not where you want a potentially hallucinatory AI in control, and it speaks to why Apple has carefully sandboxed its ChatGPT integration with Siri.  Amazon is also working on a new and improved voice assistant, and while the company says its already integrated generative AI into components of Alexa, according to a report from Fortune, the new Alexa isn’t even close to ready.  The company announced an “all-new, smarter and more conversational Alexa” powered by a new Alexa LLM last fall with an impressive demo. It touted an Alexa that should understand conversational phrases for more human-like interactions, interpret context more effectively, and complete multiple requests from one command — like “Alexa, call Mom, turn on the living room lights, and lock the front door.”  But we’ve seen no sign of this superpowered Alexa since, just vague assurances that it’s in a limited preview. This may be because, according to Fortune, the company is struggling to merge the old Alexa and its capabilities with its vision for the next-gen voice assistant.  Similarly, Apple is taking a slow and steady approach. The new Siri won’t launch until the fall and, even then, will be labeled a beta. It also won’t have a place in the smart home at first: it’s not supported on any of Apple’s voice-forward, home-based devices such as the HomePod smart speakers and the Apple TV. It’s also not coming to the Apple Watch yet.  The new Siri is not supported on any of Apple’s voice-forward, home-based devices such as the HomePods and Apple TV While these devices likely don’t have enough processing power to run generative models, many of which Apple wants to operate locally for privacy purposes, this feels like a big gap. The smart home is a key space for a more intelligent voice assistant, not only can it help bridge the personal and home spaces, but it could help make running a smart home much easier.  Amazon’s former head of devices and service, Dave Limp, told me last year that the new Alexa LLM they’re building has been trained on hundreds of smart home APIs. This could give Alexa the context needed to proactively manage smart home devices like lights, locks, thermostats and such, making them easier to set up and use, and allowing you to give commands like, “Alexa, it’s dark in here and I’m cold,” and the voice assistant will know what to do.  In contrast to Apple, Amazon has said its new Alexa will come to all of its Echo smart speakers, including the very first Echo released in 2014. (It can do this by offloading processing to the cloud.) Although, as the HomePod Mini is now four years old, it’s my guess we’ll see a new model with updated hardware designed for AI very soon. Apple cannot afford to cede the home to Alexa any further. While the stage is set for the second coming of the voice assistant, there’s still a long way to go until we see act 1. It’s also possible the show will open with some entirely new characters if these companies can’t find a way to effectively build the new technology onto the foundations of the old.  It’s entirely possible Google will launch a completely new voice assistant That appears to be the road Google is taking. Its Google Assistant voice assistant has yet to undergo a big AI overhaul, with the company reportedly putting all its resources into the new AI-powered Gemini assistant. While a symbiosis there seems the natural move, given Google’s penchant for abandoning the old it’s entirely possible the company will launch a completely new voice assistant built from the ground up on generative AI. However they get there, the promise of these smart voice assistants is exciting, especially for whichever company can effectively merge the personal assistant with the home. Imagine if your HomePod could welcome you home with personalized updates, tell you that you need to leave for your daughter’s school play 15 minutes early because of traffic, and have your EV charged with enough range to get you there by the time you walk out the door. That’s a lot more like what we were promised — and it’s a whole lot smarter than setting a timer.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Several Tesla shareholders are accusing Elon Musk and the company’s board of knowingly diverting talent and resources away from the company and directing it toward Musk’s rival artificial intelligence company, xAI.  In a lawsuit, the shareholders allege that Musk and the board breached their fiduciary duty to Tesla by launching xAI, which was founded in 2023 on the premise of understanding “the true nature of the universe.” The plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in Delaware, where the company is still incorporated, only hours before Tesla shareholders are set to vote on a proposal to reincorporate the company in Texas after a Delaware court judge voided Musk’s enormous pay package. The lawsuit was first reported by Business Insider and TechCrunch.  The plaintiffs include the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund as well as two individual shareholders, Daniel Hazen and Michael Giampietro, on behalf of Tesla itself. They note that, for years, Musk has sought to position Tesla not as a car company but as a robotics and AI powerhouse. The claim helped propel Tesla’s stock price, resulting in the company’s value exceeding that of top automakers combined.  All the while, Musk was “diverting scarce talent and resources from Tesla to xAI, and raised billons of dollars for xAI while touting xAI’s access to Tesla’s AI-related data,” the lawsuit reads. Last week, xAI raised $6 billion in its initial funding round, which it said it will use to bring its first products to market. So far, xAI has launched Grok, a supposedly edgier version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is available via X but only for Premium subscribers.  2024 06 13 e Filed Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint Tesla Xai by ahawkins8223 on Scribd The plaintiffs also cite a recent CNBC report about Musk ordering thousands of Nvidia-made AI chips destined for Tesla to be diverted to the social media company. In a post on X after CNBC’s story published, Musk said that Tesla lacked the capacity to accept the Nvidia GPUs because the company’s factory in Austin, Texas, is incomplete. He also estimated that Tesla would spend $3–4 billion on AI chips from Nvidia in 2024. They also cite other posts by Musk suggesting he needs a larger stake in Tesla — to the tune of 25 percent — to feel comfortable growing Tesla into an AI and robotics leader. The plaintiffs also accuse Tesla’s board of doing nothing, allowing Musk “to plunder resources from Tesla and divert them to xAI; and to create billions in AI-related value at a company other than Tesla.” This isn’t the only shareholder lawsuit to emerge this week. An institutional investor sued the company, claiming Musk earned billions of dollars selling Tesla stock using insider information.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Microsoft is back with another Xbox Games Showcase this year, and this time around, there’s a Call of Duty direct straight after the main show. This is Microsoft’s first Xbox Games Showcase to feature games from across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda, and Xbox Game Studios, as well as third-party titles. I think this is going to be a big Xbox showcase, with a runtime that could approach the two-hour mark. Get ready for new game reveals, lots of release dates, and some potential surprises. The Xbox Games Showcase starts on Sunday, June 9th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT / 6PM UK. Microsoft is streaming its big Xbox showcase live on YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. You can also watch the showcase from the video embedded at the top of this article. I would expect to see more than 15 first-party Xbox games at this showcase. Microsoft has a busy fall ahead for Xbox, with Bethesda currently targeting September for its Starfield Shattered Space expansion, and Age of Mythology: Retold is tracking for an early September release, too.  I’m also expecting Activision to announce it’s launching Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on October 25th, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 should follow in November. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also expected to debut in December, according to sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans. Among all of these big game releases, there are new seasons for Overwatch 2, Call of Duty, and Diablo IV. I’d expect we’ll also hear about Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion, which is currently tracking for an early October release. World of Warcraft’s The War Within DLC is also due in late August, I understand. Microsoft has also been considering putting Towerborne into an early access program later this year, and there’s still the question of when Avowed will launch. I heard a few months ago that Avowed was targeting a November release, so I’m hoping we’ll hear more about that during the Xbox showcase. We’re also still waiting to see if a long-rumored Gears of War collection will ever be confirmed. Beyond what’s planned for 2024, I’m fully expecting Microsoft to announce two new games — the next installments for Doom and Gears of War. These will be the big announcements of the show, but there could be a bunch of third-party games, too.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Apple is introducing a new dynamic screensaver and wallpaper combo in macOS Sequoia that respectfully eulogizes retro Macintosh iconography. Simply dubbed “Macintosh,” MacRumors reports that the animated wallpaper shifts through graphics designed by Susan Kare, the artist and early Apple employee responsible for many of the typefaces and interface elements on the first Macintosh personal computer. Users can’t control which icons will appear in the randomized Macintosh wallpaper. Some recognizable highlights include the iconic “Happy Mac” boot-up icon, the Dogcow (also known as Clarus) used within the Print Setup dialog box, the floral-inspired Command icon, and the Bomb that appeared when classic macOS crashed. The wallpaper is available in eight colors alongside Spectrum, Random, and Accent. macOS Sequoia‌ is required to get the full animated effect, but that’s only currently available to developers ahead of the full version being released later this fall. For now, Apple design enthusiast Basic Apple Guy has shared a bunch of high-resolution screenshots of the Macintosh wallpaper that showcase some of its best bits and work beautifully as still wallpapers on other devices.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

The move suggests that OpenAI isn’t able to get all the compute it needs from Microsoft.,2024-06-12T20:46:06Z,"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. OpenAI and Microsoft are teaming up with Oracle to get more compute capacity to run ChatGPT. As part of a partnership announced this week, the three companies are working together so that OpenAI can use the Microsoft Azure Al platform on Oracle’s infrastructure. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hasn’t shied away from the fact that his company needs substantially more infrastructure to power its services. He has even been in discussions to raise billions of dollars for an AI chip venture. In the press release for the Oracle deal this week, he said Oracle’s chips will “enable OpenAI to continue to scale.” To date, OpenAI has relied fully on Microsoft for its compute needs. In turn, Microsoft has invested $13 billion for a 49 percent stake in OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary and the exclusive right to commercially license its technology. But as this Oracle deal makes clear, OpenAI needs more compute than Microsoft alone can give if it wants to keep up with demand and prevent future ChatGPT outages.  Microsoft and OpenAI are clearly sensitive about how this Oracle deal is perceived. On Wednesday, OpenAI issued a follow-up statement saying that “our strategic cloud relationship with Microsoft is unchanged” and that the new partnership “enables OpenAI to use the Azure AI platform on OCI infrastructure for inference and other needs.” (Inference refers to the act of running AI models in production through applications like ChatGPT.)  OpenAI also made clear that the pre-training of its frontier models “continues to happen on supercomputers built in partnership with Microsoft.”  There’s another level of awkwardness to OpenAI and Oracle working together: Oracle also provides infrastructure to xAI, Elon Musk’s OpenAI rival.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
65,Victoria Song,Samsung’s Galaxy Watch FE is its new entry-level smartwatch,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24176939/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-price-specs,The $199.99 Galaxy Watch FE is the new entry-level smartwatch in Samsung’s wearable lineup.,2024-06-13T12:00:00Z,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. The leaks were right. Samsung just announced it’s launching a third smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch FE. It’s meant to be the company’s new entry-level smartwatch, offering a more affordable option compared to its flagship Galaxy Watch models. It makes sense that Samsung’s doing this now. The Galaxy Watch series used to be relatively affordable compared to the competition, but in the past two years, Samsung’s raised the starting price of its watches by $50 to keep up with inflation. The FE will retail at $199 for the Bluetooth-only version and at $249.99 for the LTE version — which is more in line with what its watches used to cost. This also makes Samsung’s smartwatch lineup look a bit more like Apple’s, with a budget model, flagship model, and a more premium option. Like other entry-level models, the FE forgoes some bells and whistles to get that more palatable price. For example, the FE only comes in a single 40mm size with a slightly smaller 1.2-inch OLED display. The FE also has the last-gen Exynos W920 chip instead of the W930, with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Most of the sensors remain the same, but you do give up the temperature sensor that was introduced last year. The battery is also smaller at 247mAh. The Verge asked if the FE will support fast charging but did not get a response. 1/20 1/20 That said, you’re not giving up that much. Despite being the budget model, the FE has the same sapphire crystal lens, IP68 rating, and 5ATM of water resistance. It’s also got the same one-click strap mechanism, NFC payments, and built-in GPS. Connectivity-wise, you get LTE, Bluetooth 5.0, and Wi-Fi. Also, like the flagship watches, the FE has OneUI Watch 5 and Wear OS 4, abnormal high / low heart rate notifications, EKGs, body composition analysis, and personalized heart rate zones. Announcing the FE now is a bit of a surprise. Samsung typically unveils its wearables at its summer Unpacked event, which is expected to take place next month in Paris. That said, this year’s event could be a truly stacked one for Samsung’s wearable lineup. On top of a new Galaxy Watch 7, we’re expecting to see a new Galaxy Watch Ultra and the Galaxy Ring. All things considered, the relatively simple FE would’ve easily gotten lost in the shuffle.  The Bluetooth version of the Galaxy Watch FE goes on sale in the US starting June 24th. The LTE version arrives later this year.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
66,Jess Weatherbed,"Apple and OpenAI aren’t paying each other yet, says Bloomberg",https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177550/apple-openai-chatgpt-deal-payment-revenue-sharing-chatbot,"Apple reportedly believes the exposure it’s giving ChatGPT is payment enough for now, and is exploring future revenue-sharing deals with OpenAI and other AI providers.",2024-06-13T11:09:29Z,"By  Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. While the partnership between Apple and OpenAI announced at WWDC this week promises to give ChatGPT a prestigious place in Apple’s ecosystem, it seems neither party is paying the other to make that happen. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple instead believes that the exposure OpenAI will receive from being on hundreds of millions of Apple devices is “of equal or greater value than monetary payments.” The report also says this deal isn’t exclusive to OpenAI, and that Apple is in talks with Anthropic and Google to offer their respective chatbots as an alternative option, with an agreement for Google’s Gemini expected to be in place later this year. For now, Apple will use let users send certain types of queries to OpenAI’s GPT-4o model on iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, but its goal is to offer users a range of third-party AI services, akin to how Apple’s Safari browser supports different search engine options. One way that Apple is planning to make money from these partnerships, according to the Bloomberg report, is via revenue-sharing agreements. That involves taking a cut from any AI provider that monetizes results in their chatbots, such as the $20-per-month subscription plan for ChatGPT Plus. Apple is reportedly expecting chatbots and LLMs to start tempting people away from using traditional search engines. That’s not ideal for the extremely lucrative arrangement that has Google paying Apple billions of dollars to be the iPhone’s default search engine, so revenue-sharing deals could be one way for Apple to make up for the shortfall. The announcements around Apple Intelligence and its OpenAI agreement mark a significant development in Apple’s AI strategy, but it’s still early days. The company is aiming to support Apple Intelligence in additional languages besides American English next year according to Bloomberg, and is reportedly considering deals with Baidu and Alibaba to handle offering chatbot features in China, where access to ChatGPT is limited.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Android’s leadership team at Google is losing another key leader. Dave Burke, the VP of engineering for Android, is “stepping away” from heading up Android engineering and is “shifting into an advisory position while exploring AI / bio projects,” he said in an email he posted to LinkedIn. “AI has the potential to play a pivotal role in accelerating drug discovery, with wide applicability, including in hard-to-treat pediatric cancers, a topic close to my heart,” Burke said. “I’m working with Sundar to explore relevant roles at Alphabet.” Burke has been on the Android team for 14 years. Burke’s departure follows Google’s recent move to combine its Android and hardware teams into a new “Platforms and Devices” team run by Rick Osterloh. As part of that change, Google announced that Hiroshi Lockheimer, who had led Android, Chrome, and ChromeOS, would be moving on to other projects, and Sameer Samat would become president of the Android ecosystem. In his email, Burke promised more details to come about what’s next for his former team. “It’s important for me to leave you in good hands with a well thought out succession plan,” he said. “We’ll be following up shortly with some additional specifics about this change, so please keep an eye out for that.” That suggests there might be more changes on the team beyond Burke leaving, and 9to5Google reported Wednesday that Google’s platforms and devices team is “undergoing a reorganization.” Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about the reported reorg. Google is already making moves to combine pieces of its ecosystems. On Wednesday, Google announced that ChromeOS would be developed on portions of the Android tech stack in part so that it can roll out AI features more quickly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Rebel Moon saga on Netflix was an attempt from Zack Snyder to craft a sci-fi epic on the level of Star Wars — and now the director is taking another stab at making it work. Netflix just announced that the director’s cuts of both Rebel Moon films will be streaming on August 2nd. It’s not clear exactly how the new versions will be different, with Netflix saying they will “delve further into the mythology and madness of Zack Snyder’s epic sci-fi saga in the viciously sexier, bloodier world of Rebel Moon.” They will presumably be quite a bit longer than the original films — both of which clock in at over two hours — but at least they don’t appear to have been filmed in 4:3. Snyder previously said that the director’s cuts would include “close to an hour of extra content.” As part of the release, the new versions of Rebel Moon have been given new names as well. The first film, originally known as A Child of Fire, has been redubbed Chapter One: Chalice of Blood for the director’s cut. Meanwhile the second film, The Scargiver, has been given the title Chapter Two: Curse of Forgiveness.

She’s worked as an editor and writer (and occasional sci-fi author) for more years than she cares to admit to. She can be found on Threads as @barbarask. You may see Microsoft’s upcoming Recall feature, which screenshots everything you do (and has now become an opt-in feature) as a convenient way to keep an eye on your history or a problematic privacy violation. However, it’s not the first time your activity on a Windows computer will have been recorded.  As XDA Developers has pointed out, Windows 10 and 11 computers already contain an activity tracker, which was introduced in Windows 10 as part of its Timeline feature. And although Timeline was removed in Windows 11, the tracker apparently was not. It’s a simple matter to see if the tracker is still there and enabled — and then to disable it. However, if you’re too busy to deal with this right now, you may not have to worry about it.  There are now two notes on Microsoft’s support page for Activity history. The first states: “The option to send activity history to Microsoft has been deprecated from Windows 11 23H2 and 22H2, January 23, 2024-KB5034204 update,” while the second adds that you can either clear your history manually (using the above method) or just wait because “your activity history will be automatically deleted within 30 days from when your data was last synced to the cloud.” So whether or not you decide to go in and manually deactivate your Activity history depends on how much you trust Microsoft.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

One could be the upcoming robotaxi, while the other looks like a boxy van. Is the third the long-awaited Model 2?",2024-06-14T14:45:50Z,"By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla CEO Elon Musk teased three new vehicles during his presentation at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday — one more than what he showed off during the Master Plan Part 3 event last year.  In a slide showing the company’s current lineup — Models S, X, 3, Y, the Tesla Semi, and Cybertruck — three shrouded vehicles were also included.  “Obviously we’ve got some new products that we’re working on under the covers,” Musk said. “I think these are going to be pretty special.” “Obviously we’ve got some new products that we’re working on under the covers.” And that was basically it. No other details were divulged. Sure, Musk was in a giddy mood considering his shareholders just handed him a victory by reapproving his enormous $50 billion compensation package. But even the world’s most hyperbolic CEO stayed tight-lipped about what was in the pipeline.  So let’s speculate. One of those vehicles is probably the robotaxi, which Musk has said will get a proper reveal on August 8th. He even gave it a new name during a recent earnings call: “Cybercab.”  Which one do we think is the robotaxi? I’m guessing it’s the one on the far right, closest to the Cybertruck. Musk is going to want to pair his two most futuristic vehicles together like two low-poly peas in a pod.  But then again, maybe the robotaxi is the more van-shaped vehicle on the left. If this is Tesla’s first purpose-built autonomous vehicle, the one made for the ridehailing network that Musk has described as a cross between Uber and Airbnb, wouldn’t they want something a bit more high capacity — something that can squeeze in more passengers than a Model Y? Waymo’s first robotaxi was a Chrysler Pacifica minivan. It would be pretty hilarious if Tesla followed suit by introducing its own robot van.  During the presentation, a shareholder asked Musk whether he would make a more high volume electric van with enough room for 13 passengers. Musk laughed and said he would “add it to my list.” Tesla has dropped hints about a van before. In its Master Plan Part Deux, the company said it was developing “high passenger-density urban transport” and also suggested that autonomous buses could be deployed. I happen to think both of those ideas are fully dead given Musk’s notorious disdain for public transportation. But in Master Plan Part 3, the company lists “bus” and “commercial/passenger vans” as “TBD.” So maybe it’s not dead? So, if the robotaxi is on the right and the boxy vehicle on the left is some kind of van, what’s that vehicle in the upper left? Could it be the long-awaited refreshed Tesla Roadster? Or is it some kind of compact, more affordable “Model 2”?  The saga of the Model 2 — a name that Musk has never confirmed — has been a rollercoaster. Tesla bulls and investors have been trying to will it into existence for years, even though Musk has never really been fully on board. Even as far back as the Master Plan Part Deux (released in 2016), Musk said that a lower-cost vehicle cheaper than the Model 3 “is unlikely to be necessary.” Earlier this year, Musk was basically bullied by investors into recommitting to the Model 2, promising lower-cost models in the years to come. But the man is clearly tired of running a car company.  To him, AI and robots are the future. During yesterday’s presentation, he spent several minutes excitedly discussing Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots — while barely paying lip service to the company’s actual vehicular products. In his mind, Tesla’s future won’t be rolling on four wheels but, rather, walking on two legs.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Nakasone, who was nominated to lead the NSA by former President Donald Trump, directed the agency from 2018 until February of this year. Before Nakasone left the NSA, he wrote an op-ed supporting the renewal of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the surveillance program that was ultimately reauthorized by Congress in April. OpenAI says Nakasone will join its Safety and Security Committee, which was announced in May and is led by CEO Sam Altman, “as a first priority.” Nakasone will “also contribute to OpenAI’s efforts to better understand how AI can be used to strengthen cybersecurity by quickly detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats.” Recent departures tied to safety at OpenAI include co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who played a key role in Sam Altman’s November firing and eventual un-firing, and Jan Leike, who said on X that “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” “Artificial intelligence has the potential to have huge positive impacts on people’s lives, but it can only meet this potential if these innovations are securely built and deployed,“ board chair Bret Taylor said in a statement. “General Nakasone’s unparalleled experience in areas like cybersecurity will help guide OpenAI in achieving its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”  OpenAI’s board of directors now includes Nakasone, Altman, Adam D’Angelo, Larry Summers, Bret Taylor, Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Nicole Seligman, and Fidji Simo.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. OLED monitors are on a nice (albeit, still slow) trajectory toward lower prices. If you’re in the market for a gaming-centric OLED for your PC, check out the excellent LG UltraGear 27-inch 27GR95QE-B currently selling for $656.99 ($340 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo or $659.99 at Best Buy. This LG model may not be gargantuan or capable of native 4K, but its modestly sized 27-inch OLED panel has crisp QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution. It’s got the deep blacks and strong color contrast you expect in an OLED, and since it’s designed for gaming, it can reach up to 240Hz over its DisplayPort 1.4 or twin HDMI 2.1 ports — making it a great choice for pulling double-duty if you use both PC and current consoles at your desk. In fact, it has a built-in downscaler to ensure all the 4K content from a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or high-end gaming PC looks excellent. LG’s 27GR95QE-B is a 27-inch gaming monitor with a high-quality 2560 x 1440 OLED panel that supports up to 240Hz refresh for fast performance in competitive games. It has HDMI 2.1 ports with built-in downscaling for making 4K content look good on its 1440p display. Read our review. If 27 inches seems too small and the 16:9 aspect ratio too mundane for such fancy panel technology, you can also check out the larger ultrawide 34-inch LG UltraGear 34GS95QE-B curved OLED selling for $819.99 ($480 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It’s pricier, sure, but it carries similar specs in a 21:9 aspect ratio with about seven inches of extra screen width.

75,Chris Welch,Sonos draws more customer anger — this time for its privacy policy,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178433/sonos-privacy-policy-customer-data-controversy,Sonos updated its privacy policy and removed a line that previously promised the company “does not and will not sell personal information” about its many customers.,2024-06-14T14:50:06Z,"By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. It’s been a rocky couple of months for Sonos — so much so that CEO Patrick Spence now has a canned autoreply for customers emailing him to vent about the redesigned app. But as the company works to right the ship, restore trust, and get the new Sonos Ace headphones off to a strong start, it finds itself in the middle of yet another controversy. As highlighted by repair technician and consumer privacy advocate Louis Rossmann, Sonos has made a significant change to its privacy policy, at least in the United States, with the removal of one key line. The updated policy no longer contains a sentence that previously said, “Sonos does not and will not sell personal information about our customers.” That pledge is still present in other countries, but it’s nowhere to be found in the updated US policy, which went into effect earlier this month. Do you know more about what’s going on at Sonos? I’ve revealed many Sonos products through the trust of invaluable sources. If you have information regarding Sonos’ upcoming plans and future products, you can reach me confidentially and securely via Signal at 845-445-8455 or username @chriswelch.01. I’m also reachable via Instagram DM and on X. Now, some customers, already feeling burned by the new Sonos app’s unsteady performance, are sounding off about what they view as another poor decision from the company’s leadership. For them, it’s been one unforced error after another from a brand they once recommended without hesitation. Here’s the relevant part from the “how we may share personal information” section of the privacy policy as it was in 2023: Sonos does not and will not sell personal information about our customers. However, certain data practices described throughout this Privacy Statement may constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of data under California and/or other US state laws. See the below CA Addendum for more information applicable to CA residents. We want you to understand that information about our customers is an important part of our business. We only disclose your data as described in this Statement. And now, the new version: Certain data practices described throughout this Privacy Statement may constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of data under California and/or other US state laws. See the below CA Addendum for more information applicable to CA residents. We want you to understand that information about our customers is an important part of our business. We only disclose your data as described in this Statement.  The Verge has reached out to Sonos for clarification on what this change signifies and whether the company is now handling customer data differently than before. As part of its reworked app platform, Sonos rolled out web-based access for all customer systems — giving the cloud an even bigger role in the company’s architecture. Unfortunately, the web app currently lacks any kind of two-factor authentication, which has also irked users; all it takes is an email address and password to remotely control Sonos devices. The app situation is gradually improving — alarms and sleep timers were both recently restored — but getting through to Sonos customer support can still take a very, very long time in the aftermath of the top-to-bottom software overhaul.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Earlier this week, we published a guide rounding up an assortment of last-minute Father’s Day gifts for those who celebrate. However, if you need a Hail Mary and your dad is the nostalgic type with a penchant for all things Apple, the Sharge Retro 67 is currently on sale for an all-time low of $39 ($30 off) at Amazon and direct from Sharge. In February, my colleague Sean Hollister penned a personal ode to the Sharge’s three-port USB-C PD and PPS charger (and for good reason). The palm-sized Retro 67 measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.5 inches — which is relatively small for what it offers — and can output 67 watts from a single UL-certified port or 45 watts via the primary port while supplying 20 watts across the remaining two. That’s enough juice to charge a combination of devices (phones, earbuds, handhelds, etc.) or a lightweight laptop like the most recent MacBook Air. It can even slow-charge a beefier machine like the MacBook Pro using the main port, assuming you’re not in any particular hurry. Wattage is only part of the appeal, though. What makes the Retro 67, well, retro, is that it takes its design from the original Macintosh. The travel-friendly charger also sports foldable prongs and a built-in dot-matrix display, which shows you what kind of power your gadgets are receiving at any given moment. The fact it displays the iconic “digital rain” pattern from The Matrix when not in use is just a plus. This tiny Mac is powerful enough to charge a Mac — well, a MacBook Air anyhow. It advertises 67W from one port, 45W + 20W from two, or 45W + 15W + the remainder with three. Its Matrix-esque dot readout changes to the number of watts that are currently in use.

Discovery’s big plan to double down on previously established IP, the studio has ordered a slate of new projects spun off from the worlds of Adventure Time, Regular Show, and Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends. Timed to Warner Bros.’ presentation at this year’s Annecy Festival, Cartoon Network Studios announced today that it has greenlit a number of new projects including an Adventure Time film as well as series spun off from Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends and Regular Show. Variety reports that Steven Universe’s Rebecca Sugar, Over the Garden Wall’s Patrick McHale, and Adventure Time showrunner Adam Muto are all attached as members of the new film’s creative team. In addition to the movie, Cartoon Network Studios is also producing Adventure Time: Side Quests and Adventure Time: Heyo BMO, two shows aimed at younger viewers that will bring back a number of the original show’s classic characters, like Finn the Human and the Ice King. Cartoon Network Studios seems to be especially keen on courting the preschool audience, as it has also tapped Craig McCracken to revive the Foster’s Home IP with Foster’s Funtime for Imaginary Friends — a show about young imaginary friends learning the ins and outs of their whimsical world. And while the studio has yet to announce any details, J.G.

78,Chris Welch,"Jabra’s earbuds are going away, but the impact they made isn’t",https://www.theverge.com/24176836/jabra-earbuds-retrospective-65t-75t-apple-sony,"Jabra is leaving the consumer earbuds market. For years, the company’s Elite 65t and 75t earbuds were the default recommendation for an alternative to Apple’s AirPods.",2024-06-12T16:00:03Z,"By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Mere hours after announcing two new pairs of earbuds, Jabra parent company GN revealed that the Elite 10 Gen 2 and Elite 8 Active Gen 2 will mark the end of its consumer earbud business. That’s all she wrote for the long-running Elite series after years of quality products. The decision seems somewhat abrupt; earlier this month, Jabra invited select press on an “all-expenses-paid media trip” to its Copenhagen headquarters. (The Verge did not attend.) Now, just a couple weeks later, GN is acknowledging that “markets have changed” and trying to compete with Apple, Samsung, Sony, and countless other earbud brands is no longer worth the cost. “The investment required for future innovation and growth in this very competitive space is deemed unjustified,” GN wrote in its press release. It doesn’t get much more blunt than that. There’s just more money to be made in enterprise hardware and hearing aid tech. I’m sad to see Jabra bowing out. I was looking forward to testing out the company’s new LE Audio charging case, which can transmit audio from other devices like treadmills or in-flight entertainment to the earbuds. That excitement has already dampened now that the end is in sight — even if GN says it’ll continue to support existing Jabra hardware for several years. But I can also concede that Jabra’s best days in the consumer market have been behind it for some time now. In the early stages of true wireless earbuds, when many products were plagued by audio dropouts and other annoyances, the company carved out a solid reputation for itself. The Elite series became the de facto recommendation for those seeking an alternative to Apple’s AirPods. I used the same review headline twice in a row in praise of their quality. For a company that had previously been best known for dorky Bluetooth earpieces, it was an impressive feat. The peak for Jabra was really in that Elite 65t / 75t era between 2018 and 2020, when heavyweights like Sony and Samsung were still finding their footing with true wireless buds and before a raft of other competition got into the ring. This was also when the company began including a feature — multipoint Bluetooth connectivity — that took bigger players ages to implement in their own buds.  Multipoint allows you to pair with two devices at the same time, so you can be listening to music on your laptop and then seamlessly take a call on your phone. We’ve finally reached a point where this feature has (mostly) become the status quo now that Sony, Google, Sennheiser, and others are offering it. Technics’ AZ80 earbuds even let you pair with three devices at once. The big multipoint holdout remains AirPods, but Apple would tell you that its automatic switching between iPhones, iPads, and Macs is a better solution anyhow. Jabra got other things right, too. I always liked its mobile app. Sure, it was stuffed to the gills with features that some people probably didn’t even know were there — like white noise and nature soundscapes — but it always worked reliably when it came to adjusting EQ or updating the earbuds’ firmware.  But Jabra being surpassed by its much bigger rivals was inevitable. The company reached a point where it just couldn’t hang anymore in crucial areas like sound quality, noise cancellation, and so on. We’re increasingly seeing Apple, Samsung, and Google save the best ecosystem tricks for their own earbuds, which didn’t help matters. And more recently, the Elite lineup got a little too bloated and started trending toward quantity over quality. The best thing I can say about last year’s Elite 10 earbuds is that they’re extremely comfortable. But they never stood much of a chance at replacing my current favorites.  It’s a shame to see the company go, but it’s walking away from a market that’s never been more competitive across every pricing tier. So much so that GN just doesn’t see the point anymore.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

See our ethics statement. Drones aren’t just fun to fly — they’ve also become nearly mandatory in creative arsenals to satisfy clients and social media followers hungering for aerial photography and video. Thankfully, the entry-level price barrier has come crashing down over the years. The previous-generation DJI Mini 3, for example, is now just $329 ($90 off) at Amazon, down from its recently reduced starting price of $419. You can find discounts on various bundles, too, including one that throws in the video RC remote for $429 ($120 off) or the Fly More combo for $459 ($130 off) that packs three extra batteries and a carrying case. All are down to the lowest prices we’ve seen. DJI’s last-gen Mini 3 remains a great drone for beginners. The lightweight quadcopter offers a 4K sensor, excellent image stabilization, and 38 minutes of flight time on a standard battery. It’s also light enough that it doesn’t require a permit — a boon for first-time flyers. As you’d expect, the Mini 3’s feature set is a tier below the newest Mini 4 series and slightly cribbed compared to the Mini 3 Pro. It doesn’t have the omnidirectional vision or object avoidance, for example. The DJI Mini 3 is still surprisingly stable in the air — it weighs only 8.8 ounces and is small enough to comfortably rest in the palm of your hand whether or not its collapsible propeller-holding arms are folded in. However, new pilots should probably stick to more open areas as it only has downward-facing vision to help with landing. The DJI Mini 3 camera’s fidelity also doesn’t match its newer counterparts, although you can still achieve good results when snapping 48MP photos and shooting 4K HDR video at up to 30 frames per second (or up to 60 frames per second when shooting in 2.7K or 1080p). You can shoot vertically in addition to horizontally. One small benefit to its basic trappings is that its 38-minute maximum flight time beats the more substantial models by a few minutes. And because of its light weight, you won’t even need to secure a license before takeoff as long as you’re flying it in the US.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Meta now allows users to create giant group chats without having an associated Facebook page, as reported by TechCrunch. The groups, called “Communities,” allow admins to add up to 5,000 people, even if they’re not part of the same Facebook group. Meta previously introduced that feature in 2022, allowing Facebook group admins to create Discord-like chatrooms for members. This new type of chat, meanwhile, is open to anyone — users could make one for their neighborhood, school, or an event, for example. Meta notes that creating Messenger “Communities” isn’t yet available to everyone and that users should be aware there’s a different level of privacy that they typically associate with personal messages. The gradual updates to Messenger bring it more in line with platforms like WhatsApp or Discord. In 2022, WhatsApp’s messaging capabilities also expanded, letting admins of groups communicate with thousands of people at once instead of the more private, direct conversations the platform was known for.  Messaging has become a key focus for other Meta platforms like Instagram, too. Instagram head Adam Mosseri has said that DMs account for much of the platform’s growth and that young people especially spend a lot of time messaging. Last year, Instagram rolled out the ability to send mass updates via DMs — called “channels” — in a feature similar to Telegram. Creators can run their own channel for followers and send updates, announcements, and more. The company has also tried to make DMs more interactive with things like contests run through messages.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you’re still under the impression that an original MSI Claw might be a worthy purchase, I beg you to reconsider. MSI has now announced not one but two successors to the embarrassing handheld that are coming this fall — and hinting it might show off yet another one at CES in January. MSI already revealed an eight-inch Lunar Lake version dubbed the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus at Computex this week, but the company will put Intel’s Lunar Lake into a new seven-inch version at the same time. MSI Claw product management director Clifford Chun revealed the existence of that handheld in an interview with PCWorld and explained that both devices should arrive with the launch of Intel’s more efficient Lunar Lake chips this fall. Lunar Lake not only has up to 50 percent more GPU performance than the current Meteor Lake — it requires substantially less power for the same performance. One early demo showed it drawing 10 fewer watts, which could translate to a notable increase in battery life. Plus, the Claw 8 can fit a far larger battery pack at 80 watt-hours vs. the 53-watt-hour pack of the original.  Every Claw 8 in the US will come with that 80-watt-hour pack, says Chun, though he says it’s optional elsewhere. Both the new Claw 8 and Claw 7 will have revised bumpers, more responsive versions of their drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and an easier-to-replace SSD, says Chun — still the small M.2 2230 type, but they’ve been moved out from under the fan. Chun says they’ll ship with better Intel drivers this time around. Chun did not clarify whether the new seven-incher will have the larger 80Wh battery as well. “We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4.” Both will cost a similar amount to the current MSI Claw, says Chun, so expect them around $700–800. MSI is completely committed to handheld gaming PCs, says Chun. “We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4. We have a long two-year roadmap down already. We’ll continue pushing new form factors, new ideas, maybe even new CPUs.”  But not necessarily AMD: “We’re not aiming to go to AMD yet, but you know, maybe in Claw 3, Claw 4?” He hints that future handhelds are likely to be a similar size or larger: it tried five-inch and 10-inch handhelds but found them too small and too heavy respectively, though a 6-inch is possible. “Six-inch, seven-inch — you can’t really tell the difference,” he told PCWorld.  Weirdly, Chun suggests the poor showing of the original Claw came as a surprise. “We thought the seven was perfect at launch,” he says, talking about how it was a surprisingly “steep learning curve.” But he says MSI is listening and wants to rapidly fix things. “We really believe in handheld devices. Keep coming, keep letting us know, we listen, and we’ll improve.” That’s not much comfort to the original buyers who picked up a Claw mere months ago, but maybe it’ll mean good competition in the future.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
82,Sean Hollister,"MSI Claw after more updates: nope, it’s still a dud",https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/8/24174086/msi-claw-updates-review-addendum,Intel graphics driver updates don’t change my conclusion. The MSI Claw is the worst pick among today’s consumer handheld gaming PCs.,2024-06-08T10:00:00Z,"By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. When I called the MSI Claw an embarrassment in my May 18th review, one commenter pointed out they’d gotten higher benchmark scores than me. Sure enough: MSI had pushed out new graphics drivers and BIOS updates between the time I benchmarked and the time we published.  I’ve now tested those updates. In some of my tests, they’re better. In others, I actually found them worse! Overall, they don’t change my conclusion one bit: the MSI Claw is the worst pick from today’s crop of consumer handheld gaming PCs, and you should steer clear.  Below, you’ll find my new benchmark results in the same games, across all of the Claw’s standard power modes. In almost every test, you’ll see the Claw dramatically behind the competition in speed while using more power. New results bolded. All tests at 720p low, save Dirt Rally at 720p ultra. Worse, I’m still finding the Claw varies wildly between playable and completely unplayable in demanding games where the less expensive Steam Deck has no issues. In Shadow of the Tomb Raider, I saw the game repeatedly and inexplicably dip to just 20fps in a cave with no enemies around at 720p and Medium spec, before recovering to a stable 60fps a little while later.  I saw something similar in Cyberpunk 2077, even though the MSI Claw now generally has a higher framerate in that game after updates.  And I’m also now seeing some very weird behavior with the Claw when it comes to power modes. You might expect MSI’s “Performance” mode to be speedier than its “Balanced” mode, right? That’s not what I saw in Cyberpunk 2077 — and when I took a close look at the framerate dips, I noticed they always coincided with an unexpected power dip.  While the Intel Meteor Lake chip consumed a pretty stable 30 watts in Balanced mode, it tried to hit 35, 36, even 37 watts in Performance mode — and couldn’t maintain it, dipping down to 29 watts again and again. Plugged into USB-C power, the Performance mode worked better, continually pulling between 37 and 45 watts of power. Not that the extra power made an improvement in Cyberpunk, unfortunately.  And if you’re seeing higher scores than I am, I highly suggest you run that benchmark another three or four times, because it looks like MSI now runs its chip unsustainably faster for a while after you switch power modes, then throttles back down. The Asus ROG Ally does the same trick, and I always had to run my benchmarks a bunch of extra times there before I start counting, so I don’t throw off the average with outliers. I didn’t need to do that when I first reviewed the Claw. To MSI and Intel’s credit, at least Dave the Diver feels playable now at a smooth 60fps with only occasional drops, unlike in my original review.  Overall, I think the MSI Claw should never have gone on sale. I’m glad I never had the urge to buy one when it first came out. I would feel cheated, just like the users in MSI’s own forums who say they feel cheated, now that MSI has announced not one, but two improved versions less than three months after the original came out.  It certainly doesn’t help that the company put it on sale before giving reviewers a chance to warn anyone. If MSI is serious about the handheld space, and it sounds like the company is, I think it should offer a trade-in program for buyers of the original Claw. If you want to fix this, MSI, let them pick one of this fall’s revisions at a massive discount.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
83,Victoria Song,Apple announces watchOS 11 and a new training mode,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24170653/apple-watch-watchos-11-features-updates-wwdc,Apple announces watchOS 11 at its annual 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference.,2024-06-10T17:38:43Z,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Apple just announced watchOS 11, the latest version of its smartwatch platform, at WWDC 2024. Developers will be able to start tinkering with it starting today, while a public beta will arrive sometime next month. As in past years, a final public release is expected sometime this fall alongside the new Apple Watches.  As always, each version of watchOS comes with new health features. This year, athletes are getting something called Training Load, which takes the intensity and duration of workouts over the past 28 days into consideration. You’ll also be able to include an “effort rating” on a scale of one to 10 for workouts. Popular cardio workouts will have an automatically generated effort rating using a combination of your personal data and metrics collected from the workout. As with other fitness platforms, you’ll be able to compare how your seven-day training load compares to your 28-day load. The idea is to give you more insight as to whether you should push harder, ease off, or stay at the same rate.  Folks who have been clamoring for rest days on the Apple Watch will also be chuffed to know getting sick or injured will no longer break streaks. Specifically, you can now hit pause on your activity rings. You’ll also be able to adjust your activity ring goals based on the day of the week. So if you know you’re going to have a hard time squeezing in a workout on Thursdays, you’ll be able to lower your goal. Much like the iOS 18 updates, the fitness app is also getting a more customizable Summary tab. You’ll be able to arrange widgets that show metrics that you’re most interested in, including new ones for running, hiking, swimming, and mindfulness.  The Workout app will also add GPS routes to more workout types, including soccer, American football, Australian football, outdoor hockey, lacrosse, various types of skiing, snowboarding, golf, and outdoor rowing. You’ll also be able to create custom pool workouts as well as view turn-by-turn navigation directly from the Apple Watch in the Maps app — even if you don’t have a phone with you. There will also be a new Vitals app that gives you a glance at overnight health metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, sleep duration, and blood oxygen. (Well, at least on Apple Watches that still support the blood oxygen feature.) When two or more metrics are outside of the normal range, the app will notify users and give some extra context as to what may have caused the changes (e.g., illness, one too many drinks at an event, etc.).  Cycle Tracking is also getting an update that allows pregnant users to show gestational age, as well as the ability to log pregnancy symptoms. The Health app will also add some additional reminders and alerts, such as monthly mental health assessments and notifications regarding walking steadiness in the third trimester if an increased fall risk is detected. With watchOS 11, Live Activities will be coming to the Apple Watch. There will also be new safety features, so if you take late-night runs, your friends will be able to keep tabs on you. For workouts, this will happen automatically. This is similar to the safety features introduced on the Pixel Watch 2 last year.  Live Activities will also play into the Smart Stack, which Apple introduced last year with watchOS 10. For example, if you have a concert ticket in the Wallet app, you might see seat information pop up in the widget stack. The Smart Stack will also more intelligently shuffle relevant widgets depending on what you need. The new Translation app will automatically pop up if you travel to an area where the native language differs from the one on your Apple Watch. If there’s a thunderstorm creeping up in your area, you might see the weather widget instead. There’ll also be more widgets, including those from Shazam, Photos, and Distance. Double tap, which was introduced last year, will also get a few new tricks. Mainly, you’ll be able to use it to scroll within supported apps like Messages, Calendar, or Weather. Developers will also get access to the double tap, Live Activities, and Smart Stack APIs, so hopefully the feature and smart stack will be a bit more robust with third-party apps going forward. Surprisingly, there weren’t many new watchfaces this year. Instead, Apple emphasized a new redesigned Photos watchface. The revamped Photos face now uses machine learning to make recommendations on aesthetic styles, composition ,and facial expressions from your library. There’ll also be more customization options with time size, layout, and fonts. There weren’t really any AI-focused updates in watchOS 11, though you will be able to view Apple Intelligence summaries forwarded from the iPhone. (Though they’ll have to be at least the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.) This year will be the Apple Watch’s 10th anniversary, and there have been murmurs that Apple may go all out on a special “X” version like it did for the iPhone. That said, software updates aren’t always indicative of what hardware changes may be in store. For instance, Apple billed last year’s watchOS 10 as a “milestone” update after it revamped the UI to focus more on widgets, but it held little bearing on the Series 9’s actual hardware. watchOS 11 will be available for the Apple Watch Series 6 or later. While rumors before WWDC hinted that watchOS 11 might drop support for the Series 4, it’s a bit surprising to see support dropped for the Series 5 and first-gen SE as well.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News. Apple’s SharePlay is expanding to include speakers in your home. Soon, the HomePod, HomePod Mini, Apple TV, and any Bluetooth speaker will work with SharePlay and Apple Music, meaning you can share control of the music in your home with friends and family. Apple’s music service is also getting Music Haptics to allow those with hearing difficulties to experience music on iPhone. Both new features were announced at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference this week and should arrive with the tvOS and iOS updates this fall. Similar to the way SharePlay works in Apple CarPlay, this new SharePlay ability will let you give other people access to what’s playing on the speakers in your home. It’s the same concept as Spotify Jams, which lets multiple people contribute to and control a Spotify playlist. While the person launching the SharePlay session will need to have an Apple Music subscription, the people joining won’t. They’ll just need to bring their iPhone next to the iPhone of the subscriber or scan a QR code in the Apple Music SharePlay window. Once approved, they can then control what’s playing on the HomePod, Apple TV, or Bluetooth speaker and add tracks to the playlist through the Apple Music app.  If this sounds familiar, it’s because Apple first planned to bring SharePlay to HomePods with the iOS 17.4 Beta, but the feature was removed before the full release.  SharePlay first launched for iPhones in iOS 15 as a service that let you stream music, online videos, and movies with friends over FaceTime. The CarPlay implementation followed in iOS 17, and now with iOS 18, you will finally be able to share that DJ control with friends in your home. A new Music Haptics feature for Apple Music uses the iPhone’s Taptic Engine to “play taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music,” giving users with hearing difficulties a different way to sense the sound.  Apple says Music Haptics will work across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog and will also be available as an API so developers can add the feature to their apps. It is scheduled to arrive this fall with iOS 18.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
85,Wes Davis,Apple skipped over the best visionOS 2 updates,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175689/apple-vision-pro-2-wwdc-2024-keynote-best-updates,Apple didn’t discuss the arguably best updates coming to visionOS 2 later this year during its WWDC 2024 keynote presentation.,2024-06-11T15:34:23Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Apple mentioned a few new features coming to the Vision Pro during its WWDC 2024 keynote presentation on Monday, such as the ability to turn your 2D photos into 3D ones and support for using the headset on trains. But the company glossed right over some of the most sorely needed features that it’s adding to visionOS — and those quieter changes make for a much more exciting update. After the update arrives this fall, you’ll be able to see a Magic Keyboard while you’re working in a virtual environment, use any Bluetooth mouse you want, and rearrange your homescreen icons — including putting iPad and iPhone apps where you want. These are all features that probably should have been there from the beginning, and they’ll improve the day-to-day experience of using the Vision Pro in meaningful ways. Apple says the Vision Pro will also start saving eye and hand setups for guest users for 30 days, too. It’s been nothing short of a pain to share a Vision Pro with anyone because each time you pop it in guest mode, that person has to go through setup all over again. That’s made it hard for me to get my partner to try out the headset. (I’m sure I’m not the only person who’s experienced that.) I’d rather be able to set up totally separate profiles, but this is at least a step in that direction. Sports fans will be pleased to know that Apple is also adding five-screen multiview streaming in the Apple TV app, something the company added to its Apple TV streaming box last year. And you’ll be able to stream content via AirPlay to the Vision Pro from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac — which, depending on how well it works, could come in handy if you want to play a game in the Vision Pro that runs on a Mac but not on the headset. Lastly, when you encounter a video on the web, you’ll be able to break it out into a free-floating video player — something Apple was bound to do since neither YouTube nor Netflix have built apps for the Vision Pro. Users may still prefer the dedicated third-party apps for the services, like Juno or Supercut, but being able to watch other online videos that way will be nice. Those details all showed up somewhere in Apple’s press materials. But there’s even more in the release notes for the first visionOS 2 developer beta (which, by the way, is now available). Here’s a brief list of additional features it notes are on the way: Apple may not have hit my entire wishlist during its WWDC keynote, but I was startled by how specifically it’s addressing things I want out of visionOS, like the ability to call up the homescreen with a single gesture. And to be fair, it really did highlight one big crowd-pleaser yesterday: a giant widescreen virtual display that wraps around your head. As a staunch three-monitor user, I couldn’t be more pleased with that news.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
86,Quentyn Kennemer,Anker’s 3-in-1 Qi2 charger is $30 off in its first sale,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173276/anker-qi2-maggo-charging-station-deal-sale,"Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station with Qi2 is down to $69.99 in its first sale. It charges and magnetically holds your iPhone and Apple Watch, with a third spot for AirPods.",2024-06-07T14:03:13Z,"By  Quentyn Kennemer, a writer who helps The Verge's readers save money by surfacing the best tech deals and presenting the latest product recommendations from our experts. He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. As might have been expected, mobile accessory makers used Qi2’s arrival as an opportunity to fill out their charger lineup with the new wireless fast charging standard. Equally predictable was that many of those products started in a price tier quite a bit higher than their equivalent previous generation models — and that prices would eventually drop. Anker was one of the earliest to appear, and it’s one of the first to bring its 3-in-1 MagGo Wireless Charging Station well under $100 — you can now pick the charging station up for $69.99 ($30 off) at Amazon when clipping the coupon or directly from Anker with code WSCPV2KWZ3XE. Anker’s newest 3-in-1 charging station adds Qi2, the MagSafe-derived magnetic charging standard based on MagSafe that delivers 15W speeds to compatible iPhones. It also has a magnetic holder that can charge your Apple Watch and a roomy base that can also charge AirPods and other wireless earbuds. The tree-like design props up your Qi2 / MagSafe iPhone at an angle, and ditto for your Apple Watch — it charges both at their fastest possible speeds. There’s a third charging area in the base that you can plop your AirPods or other wireless charging earbuds onto as well. It’s helpful to know that you’ll need at least a 40W adapter to charge each device at its fastest possible speed, but Anker generously includes one in the box alongside a five-foot USB-C cable. I own a similar 3-in-1 Qi2 charging stand by ESR, which, at $64.99 right now, is the only one of its kind from a brand we trust that’s even cheaper than Anker’s. There’s one big design difference between the two — instead of hiding a detachable Apple Watch holder behind the phone like ESR does, Anker keeps it anchored next to the iPhone. (I like puns, okay?)  That may not seem significantly useful at first considering your iPhone will show more information than your Apple Watch while its StandBy nightstand mode is activated. But take it from me: you’ll appreciate not having to crane your neck over the top every time you want to check the wearable’s battery.  Anker’s nonslip base for earbuds is also considerably wider and has raised edges, which is great during a groggy stupor. It means you’re less likely to knock the charging case off the table when you’re switching sleeping positions or miss the mark when trying to drop your earbuds onto it. Both of those scenarios have happened to me.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  An unofficial site tracking titles in the Epic Games library may have just leaked a ton of upcoming games, as reported earlier by Wccftech. The site, called EpicDB, was taken offline shortly after it posted information scraped from the Epic Games Store catalog on Monday, but that didn’t stop people from scanning the list and posting their findings. You can see the list of games from publishers like Bethesda, Sega, Sony, Square Enix, and others in a series of screenshots posted by a user on a ResetEra forum. While some, like Turok, are easy to spot, others are listed under previously rumored codenames, such as “Parkside” or BioShock 4.  There are still other titles under codenames we haven’t heard about. Some users speculate that “Momo” could point to a Final Fantasy 9 remake, while “Selma” may be the PC port of Red Dead Redemption 1. The codename “Utah” could also hint at the PC version of The Last of Us Part 2, which is rumored to be almost ready to launch. Epic Games has since pushed an update preventing sites like EpicDB from scraping its list of unpublished games. “We released an update tonight so third-party tools can’t surface any new unpublished product titles from the Epic Games Store catalog,” Epic Games spokesperson Brian Sharon said in a statement to The Verge. But with so many other titles listed under unknown codenames, like CurlyWurly from Sega and Brownie from Bethesda, internet sleuths still have plenty of mysteries to figure out.

88,Gaby Del Valle,A growing number of Americans are getting their news from TikTok,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177053/tiktok-news-pew-social-media-study-x-facebook-instagram,A survey by the Pew Research Center found that 40 percent of TikTok users regularly get news on the app.,2024-06-12T18:09:15Z,"By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. As TikTok becomes a more popular news source for Americans, young adults increasingly believe the platform exposes them to information they’re unlikely to see elsewhere, according to a new survey of Americans’ news habits.  The survey, released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center, looks at the role major social media platforms — Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X — play in Americans’ news diets. According to the survey, TikTok is the second most popular source of news after X, though most TikTok users don’t primarily think of the shortform video app as a news source.  Among TikTok users, only 15 percent say keeping up with the news is a major reason they use the app. Still, 35 percent of those surveyed said they wouldn’t have seen the news they get on TikTok elsewhere. And unlike other apps, the news users see on TikTok is just as likely to come from influencers or celebrities as it is from journalists — and it’s far more likely to come from total strangers. (Meanwhile, most Facebook and Instagram users say the news that pops up on their feeds is posted by friends, relatives, or other people they know; on X, users are more likely to see news posted by media outlets or reporters.)  Though most TikTok users don’t primarily use the platform with news in mind, the Pew survey suggests that its popularity as a news source is on the rise — as are lawmakers’ concerns about the information users see on the app. In April, President Joe Biden signed a bill that would ban TikTok unless its China-based parent company divests from the app within a year. Some supporters of the so-called TikTok ban (who often emphasize that the legislation is not a ban since ByteDance can prevent it by selling TikTok) say the issue lies in TikTok’s powerful algorithm and the role the Chinese government could play in shaping what information, including news, 170 million American users see.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
89,Wes Davis,The best small updates Apple didn’t mention at WWDC,https://www.theverge.com/24176837/apple-ios-18-macos-sequoia-beta-updates-wwdc-2024,A ton of small touches that Apple didn’t talk about in its WWDC 2024 presentation bring fun animations or clever quality-of-life updates this fall.,2024-06-12T17:15:52Z,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Apple left out a lot of small updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote this year. It makes sense: the company had a lot to talk about, with a third of its presentation entirely devoted to new AI features. But that doesn’t make the features that didn’t get airtime any less worth talking about. From new bezel animations to better ways to manage widgets, there is plenty to discover in the first round of betas for iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and more. Here are some of our favorites so far: If you’re not in a place to watch that video, that’s fine. I’ve also broken the new features out below (plus a few more). When you press the side buttons while running the iOS 18 beta, there’s a clever new animation that makes it look like you’re pushing the bezel into your screen a little bit. At first glance, there’s not much purpose here other than to add a little whimsy. But it might also be a practical visual indicator if Apple eventually releases iPhones with solid-state side buttons that don’t move when you press them, simulating a click with vibration instead. And it’s hard not to think of the inky animations of the Dynamic Island (the pill-shaped selfie camera and Face ID sensor cutout from some recent iPhones).  Bilingual people might be pleased to hear you can type in two languages at once in the iOS 18 beta without toggling between them again and again by tapping the wireframe globe on the iOS keyboard and picking the new language. It takes some setup under the iOS keyboard language settings (Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard), but the change will stop bad autocorrect results just because you want to type a couple of words in Spanish in an otherwise English text! Remember the Action Button picker that came with the iPhone 15 Pro? While not quite so over the top, people found that tapping the flashlight icon in the iOS 18 betas brings down a similarly fun little animation of a flashlight that you can swipe vertically to raise and lower luminance. You can also slide your finger left and right to adjust the actual shape of the beam! It only works with the iPhone 15 Pro phones, though, as they have a special flash not found on other iPhones. Apple is also working on a better way to resize widgets in iOS 18. When you long-press, you’ll get a row of size options right there in the contextual menu, rather than having to pick “Edit Widget” and go through all the rigamarole of picking a size there. One of the best quality-of-life upgrades for the Vision Pro is that the headset will show you your keyboard when you’re fully in a virtual environment now. It didn’t do that before, so if you wanted to, say, work on top of a mountain, you had to either use partial immersion in the scene or clumsily paw at your keyboard. It’s not perfect — it’s mainly designed to work with the Magic Keyboard and, in my testing, seems to inconsistently recognize my mechanical keyboard. But it’s a welcome change all the same. Apple is adding some new nostalgic “Macintosh” wallpapers in macOS Sequoia, and they come with a very pleasant animation. Seeing voicemail transcriptions right in the notification will save you so many taps. Beta users have also spotted a more granular set of charging limit options for iPhone 15 devices — instead of just choosing to limit charge to 80 percent, there’s a slider between 80 and 100 percent, with stops every 5 percent along the way. While there are tons more updates hidden throughout Apple’s current set of betas, we have to stop somewhere. If you’re interested in trying out the new betas and don’t want to wait for their public releases, you’ll need to sign up for the developer program and then follow Apple’s instructions. (We have our own guide, if you find that easier!) Make sure you back up your device before you download the beta, though, and beware: betas can be buggy, and there’s potential for things to go seriously wrong. It’s fun to mess with betas on an old iPhone, but it’s not a great idea on your primary phone or computer.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

Just because this is the final season, it doesn’t mean we won’t see any more League of Legends adaptations going forward. In a League Dev Update posted on Tuesday, the Arcane team says this is only the “first of many stories they will tell in Runeterra.” “Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,” Arcane producer Christian Linke says in a statement. “From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.” The Arcane team says it’s currently working on new projects in both TV and film and that we can expect to hear an update by the end of this year. Arcane’s second season still doesn’t have an exact release date, but Netflix says it will arrive in November 2024. The League of Legends adaptation made its debut on Netflix in 2021 in collaboration with developer Riot Games.

The clip was released as the final portion of Summer Game Fest and followed an announcement from BioWare that the next Dragon Age would no longer be called Dreadwolf. The studio says that the footage shown here, which includes around 15 minutes of actual gameplay, takes place during the “opening moments of the game,” and has been edited somewhat to avoid spoilers. It shows off some of the combat, conversations, and a handful of cutscenes. Earlier during Summer Game Fest, the developer released a short trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase, which showed off a few of the new characters in the fantasy RPG: It’s been a long time coming for Dragon Age fans. The next game in the series was first teased way back in 2018, and after some reassurances that everything was fine, it was eventually given the title Dreadwolf in 2022.

See our ethics statement. It’s not surprising that the M3 MacBook Air’s value is strengthening the longer it’s been out, but the laptop is becoming increasingly hard to overlook when compared to the 13-inch M2 model — especially since you can get a 13-inch MacBook Air with an M3 chip for only $70 more than the current sale price of the base M2 model. Right now, the base M3 configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is going for just $899 ($200 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will. Read our review. The 2024 Air is the most recent entrant in Apple’s lightweight laptop line, one that continues to offer all-day battery life, a sleek design, and excellent performance for carrying out everyday computing tasks. The performance bump over the previous generation isn’t major, but it offers moderate speed improvements for both the processor and SSD. When paired with meaningful upgrades such as Wi-Fi 6E and the ability to run up to two external monitors when the lid is closed, it’s a respectable progression.  Those are very specific and otherwise niche needs, however. Unless you need multiple monitors, you might find the benefits negligible, if not virtually indiscernible. You shouldn’t necessarily feel compelled to upgrade if you own an M2 machine, but it’s probably worth considering if you’re coming from an M1 or older Intel-based model.  The M3 Air will get all of the Apple Intelligence features coming to macOS Sequoia in the fall, too, which the company announced during its recent WWDC 2024 keynote. It’s uncertain whether future developments will eventually require the M4 chip’s neural processing unit that Apple introduced in the latest iPad Pro, but for now, the company has promised AI feature parity among all M-series silicon dating back to the M1, so it’s a relatively safe upgrade.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."

The 2022 Dell XPS 13 Plus showed up with a bold new design: a trackpad that blends seamlessly into the chassis, a perfectly flush “zero-lattice” chiclet keyboard, and a “capacitive touch function row.” Unfortunately, the new look was overshadowed by the fact that it ran too warm and had too short a battery life. Now, Dell has given the whole XPS lineup that same futuristic design, from the Intel or Qualcomm-powered XPS 13 models to new 14- and 16-inch sizes that seem aimed directly at the MacBook Pro. The XPS 14 ($2,500 as reviewed) doesn’t suffer from the same issues as the 13 Plus or even the XPS 15 — yet it’s still underwhelming. The XPS 14 can be configured with a discrete graphics card, like the XPS 15, but even with a smaller chassis and a more powerful GPU, it stays much cooler than the last XPS 15 we reviewed — or even the 13 Plus. The Meteor Lake Intel Core Ultra 7 155H is 21 percent faster than the Core i7-1280P in the XPS 13 Plus, and if it had been around two years ago, it would have fixed other issues we had with the 13 and 15 besides heat and battery life, like performance. Even with an OLED display, the XPS 14’s battery lasts twice as long — 12 hours compared to the 13 Plus’ six — with a battery that’s only 23 percent larger. That’s fantastic. The all-new Dell XPS 14 has up to 12 hours of battery life, a 400-nit OLED touch display, and sports the same design as the 2022 Dell XPS 13 with an “invisible” trackpad and touch function row. The list of improvements continues: the 14-inch model has three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports instead of just two, plus a combo audio jack and microSD slot, and it’s configurable up to 64GB of memory and 4TB of storage space. The XPS 14 is also 1.1 pounds heavier than the 13, though only a 10th of an inch thicker, and the display is lower resolution but physically larger. It’s a more reasonable price — $1,500 for the base model and $2,500 for the specific configuration reviewed here — but still expensive compared to similar laptops.  Yet, I’m underwhelmed by all these objectively good improvements because I do not like how it feels to type on the XPS 14. The key travel is fine even though it’s shallow, but the switches feel too springy, like the warped part of a metal Slinky that pops up every time you try to push it back down. The plastic key caps also feel too thin for an elegant and sturdy laptop, and I’m not a fan of how close together they are placed for their size. The lack of a traditional function row throws off my muscle memory. I keep mistaking the tilde key for the escape key and caps lock for the tab key, and I can’t get used to hitting the esc button — or any button on the touch bar — because there is no tactile feedback. It’s blended into the chassis just like the trackpad, but the trackpad has haptics, so why doesn’t the function row? Yes, I can look at the screen to see if I hit the right button, but it’s more satisfying to see and feel the result of a button press. I don’t mind the undefined trackpad space since it spans such a wide area below the keyboard. If I tap or press far enough to the left or right, it’s like using a regular trackpad. I don’t always get it right, so there are times I use the OLED touchscreen to navigate just for the sake of efficiency, but not often.  But I spent longer than I should have looking for the power button. I eventually found it to the right of the backspace key. There’s no icon to signal it’s a power button. It’s just a dark gray key that blends quietly into the keyboard, yet I still felt obtuse for missing it at first. While the optional RTX 4050 GPU is great for injecting more speed into graphics or video work, the Dell XPS 14 is not a gaming-first laptop. It is possible to run a game like Baldur’s Gate 3 on the XPS 14 with the right settings, but there are gaming laptops like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 that come with more powerful hardware for less money and include gaming-specific features like adaptive sync and software for fine-tuning things like fan speed and GPU clock speed. From price to performance, the XPS 14 is not as good of an alternative to the MacBook Pro as the XPS 15 once was. The base M3 chip kicks its butt in almost all of our benchmarks, and while Apple removed its divisive touch bar, Dell put a less useful one in. The invisible haptic trackpad looks better than the MacBook Pro’s traditional one, but it’s slightly harder to use — and the MacBook’s keyboard is much nicer (and so was the one on the XPS 15). The XPS 14 is more competitive with some Windows laptops, like the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED, but it’s still too expensive, and if you don’t need a new laptop for 3D modeling or video work, it makes more sense to stick with integrated graphics and save $400. Yet, with the looming release of the $1,300 Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered XPS 13, it’s a good idea to hold off on buying any Dell XPS until the reviews are in. In her review of the XPS 13 Plus, Monica Chin, The Verge’s former laptop reviewer, said the new design felt like it made the same mistakes Apple did with the 2016 MacBook Pro redesign, with too many sacrifices in the name of thinness. With the XPS 14, Dell addressed the 13 Plus’ performance and battery life, but the shallow, springy keyboard, ambiguously labeled power button, and touch function row inherited from the 13 Plus keep the XPS 14 feeling underwhelming. It looks nice, but it isn’t as nice to use.  Photography by Joanna Nelius / The Verge  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
97,Umar Shakir,Google is ready to fill free streaming TV channels with ads,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175676/google-fast-ads-streaming-tv-network,Google TV network lets advertisers get spots within free FAST streaming content. Google Ad campaigns can extend to YouTube as well.,2024-06-10T23:32:01Z,"By  Umar Shakir, a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  Google is launching a new advertising network that serves targeted ads to Google TV-powered streaming boxes and smart TVs. The ads service, known as the Google TV network, lets advertisers place unskippable in-stream ad spots across more than 125 live channels — many that are FAST, or free ad-supported streaming TV channels that Google’s been hell-bent on getting users to notice. Google says there are 20 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV OS devices, a significant figure for advertisers to consider. The reach can go even further when including YouTube, which reaches over 150 million monthly active viewers in the living room. Google Ads and Google Display & Video 360 users can expand their campaigns to include the Google TV network by checking a new box under YouTube & Google. Google Ads can spread across networks on Google TV, and include Google-owned ad inventory in third-party apps. According to Google, viewers of Google TV’s free channels watch on average 75 minutes per day. FAST channels are growing fast since it’s the closest thing to paid cable service without the bill, and while the content is mostly reruns, sometimes people just want that old-school background noise — a perfect place for ads.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
98,Victoria Song,The Pixel Watch 2 can now detect when you’ve been in a car crash,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176081/google-pixel-watch-crash-fall-detection-paypal-smartwatch-wearables,"Google is updating the Pixel Watch lineup’s safety features, with car crash detection for the Pixel Watch 2 and improved fall detection for bikes on both watches.",2024-06-11T16:00:00Z,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Starting today, Google’s Pixel Watch lineup is getting some new and improved safety features. The Pixel Watch 2 will get car crash detection, while both Pixel Watches will get improved fall detection. Car crash detection has been available on Pixel phones since 2019 and will work similarly on the Pixel Watch 2. Once the watch detects you’ve been in a severe car crash, the watch will check in to make sure you’re alright via an on-screen prompt. If you don’t respond, it’ll automatically call emergency services. Your emergency contacts will also be notified with your real-time location.  The Pixel Watch lineup has had fall detection for a while now, but today’s update is geared toward cyclists. Google didn’t get into much detail, but ostensibly, it’s tweaked the algorithm to better differentiate a hard fall while walking versus getting thrown from your bike.  Google is playing a bit of catch up here. Apple introduced fall detection for bikes with watchOS 8 in 2021 and crash detection on the Apple Watch Series 8 in 2022. That’s not a bad thing — the Pixel Watch didn’t launch until 2022. What’s more important is that, with these updates, Google is continuing to close the feature gap between the Apple Watch and Android smartwatches. Car crash detection, for example, is a feature we’ve yet to see on a Wear OS watch. That said, these safety features have a few caveats. You have to have location enabled, LTE service, or an internet connection via your phone. Fall detection also isn’t available in every country just yet. This month’s Pixel drop isn’t limited to safety features, however. Both Pixel Watches are also getting PayPal in Google Wallet. And as we reported earlier, all Wear OS 3 smartwatches will now get access to a revamped Google Home app that adds complications and Tiles.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
99,Richard Lawler,Google’s June Pixel update brings Gemini AI to cheaper phones,https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176127/google-pixel-feature-drop-june-gemini-nano,"Google’s new update for Pixel phones brings expanded access to AI features, more control over which camera lens you’re using, and Find My Device when your phone is off.",2024-06-11T16:00:00Z,"By  Richard Lawler, a senior editor following news across tech, culture, policy, and entertainment. He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.  Google’s latest feature drop for Pixel devices is a big one for people who want to run its AI tech on cheaper phones, folks who constantly misplace their phones, and photographers who want a little more control.   The latest update, which starts rolling out today, will make the mobile-ready Gemini Nano model that was already available to Pixel 8 Pro owners available as an option on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8A phones, too. Apple just announced a slew of new AI features for its platforms, but similar to Google’s initial announcement that it eventually walked back, Apple has restricted Apple Intelligence to people with the latest iPhone 15 Pro. However, on those slightly lower-specced devices, you will have to go into the developer options to turn it on. In an interview on the Made by Google podcast, Google Devices & Services Software vice president Seang Chau described that toggle as a choice made to restrict it for people who understand the “potential impact to the user experience” of running an AI model on a device with less memory available to power features like Summarize in Recorder and Smart Reply. If you’re using a Pixel 8 Pro or one of the other devices with the Gemini Nano enabled in developer settings, then you’ll also get access to “more detailed, downloadable summaries” of recorded conversations. Other features that are just for the Pixel 8 family in this set of updates include the availability of the Find My Device update that can locate your phone even when it’s off, or the battery is drained for “at least 23 hours” and support for Display Port output via the USB-C jack when you want to see your phone’s interface on a larger screen. Some features are reaching older and cheaper Pixel phones, too, like a new shortcut in the call log that makes it easy to do a reverse phone number search and try to figure out who was calling in the first place. It will be available on the Pixel Fold, as well as on Pixel 6 and newer phones.  On Pixel 6 and newer devices and the Pixel Fold, there’s support for identifying the “best moment” in a photo in HDR Plus. However, you will need a pricier Pixel to take advantage of the ability to manually select which camera lens you want to use while taking a picture, which will apply to the Pixel Fold, as well as the Pro versions of the Pixel 6, 7, and 8 phones.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly."
