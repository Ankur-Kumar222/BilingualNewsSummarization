While traditional risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are well-known, the role of specific dietary components on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is less clear.  Choline, an essential nutrient found in animal- and plant-based foods, is gaining attention for its potential heart health benefits, though its role in atherosclerosis remains debated. Observational studies, including one recently published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, have suggested higher choline intake may lower cardiovascular disease risk.  However, some animal studies indicate that choline might increase the risk of heart disease, and there is a lack of human clinical trials.  Now, a new observational study published in BMC Public Health aimed to clarify the link between choline intake and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in U.S. adults.  The second aim was to look at how choline affects metabolic syndrome and its risk factors, which contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Results showed that moderate choline intake was associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, there was no significant association between choline intake and metabolic syndrome. Despite mixed study results, experts recognize the potential for adequate choline intake to support heart health and disease prevention. This cross-sectional study examined data from 5,525 American adults 20 years and older, collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2018.  The average participant age was 48, with nearly equal numbers of men and women.  Most were non-Hispanic white, had low physical activity levels, and over 76% had abdominal obesity. The researchers identified atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in participants who had at least one of the following: Participants were divided into two groups: 5,015 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 510 without.  Metabolic syndrome was determined by the presence of at least three risk factors: high fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, triglycerides, waist circumference, or low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.  Researchers categorized participants as having conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia based on blood values or medication use. The researchers used two 24-hour dietary surveys from each NHANES participant to calculate their average choline intake. Participants’ choline intake was divided into four quartiles, placing each participant into one of four groups based on their intake. Using statistical software, the team analyzed how choline intake relates to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They considered demographic and lifestyle factors and looked at differences by sex and choline intake levels. The study results suggest that optimal heart health benefits from choline intake may occur at specific levels, with both too little and too much being less beneficial. Choline intake of around 244 milligrams daily for women and 367 milligrams daily for men appeared to offer heart health benefits. These amounts are lower than the National Institutes of Health‘s adequate intakes for adults 19 years and older, which are listed as 425 milligrams for women and 550 milligrams daily for men.  In their adjusted analysis, the researchers found that choline intake in the third quartile was potentially linked to lower odds of congestive heart failure and stroke.  However, consuming more than 342 milligrams per day seemed to slightly increase the risk of heart failure, although it didn’t notably affect stroke risk. This may be due to the brain’s ability to manage excess choline, the study authors noted.  Overall, an inverse and non-linear relationship between choline and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was observed, less notably in men. The present study found no significant link between choline intake and metabolic syndrome and its components despite the syndrome being a strong predictor of mortality in heart disease.  This finding contrasts recent research that suggested higher choline intake was associated with lower levels of certain metabolic syndrome components in adults with obesity.  The study’s observational nature, reliance on dietary questionnaires, and lack of plasma TMAO data may limit its accuracy.  The study authors also note that a sensitivity analysis revealed that the protective effect of choline on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease loses statistical significance after adjusting for participants’ total calorie intake. Philip Nimoityn, MD, FACC, a physician at Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia and Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University, not involved in the study, spoke with Medical News Today about the results.  Nimoityn noted, “The non-linear relationship is consistent with the pattern that more of a good nutritional supplement is not always better.” However, he also pointed out a major flaw in the study design: arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease was diagnosed based on the presence of heart conditions, but not all congestive heart failure or strokes are due to arteriosclerotic disease. “The data analysis was clearly compromised by combining different diseases as if they were necessarily the same. Based on this, the conflicting conclusions were not surprising,” he said.  “Prospective, controlled trials with better determination of dietary choline intake and analysis of disease outcomes with more specific and consistent definition of various cardiac disease states [are needed],” Nimoityn stated.  MNT also spoke with Kiran Campbell, RDN, a registered dietitian who specializes in heart health at Kiran Campbell Nutrition and is a medical nutrition advisor at Dietitian Insights. Campbell was not involved in the study.  “The best way to get an adequate amount of choline each day is to follow a balanced diet that includes various types of choline-rich foods,” she advised. Campbell highlighted some of the best food sources of choline, including: “Most U.S. adults do not consume adequate amounts of choline and may need to consume more,” Campbell noted.  However, instead of increasing consumption of animal-based foods high in saturated fat, she recommends opting to consume more lean protein and plant-based dietary choline sources.  Nimoityn added: “A well-balanced heart-healthy diet is likely to contain adequate amounts of choline without incurring the risk of possible overdosing with commercially available nutritional supplement products. This appears to be true for all populations.” He concluded by emphasizing the importance of combining a heart-healthy diet with other “proven and accepted measures,” including regular exercise (if safe per the patient’s doctor), avoiding smoking, preventing obesity, and aggressively managing cholesterol and triglyceride levels and inflammation as needed."
1,"Kelsey Costa, MS, RDN",Obesity: Does eating chili peppers increase or decrease risk?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-eating-chili-peppers-increase-obesity-risk,"Consuming chili peppers more frequently may be associated with a greater risk of obesity, new research suggests.",2024-06-09T10:50:50Z,"Chili peppers are spicy and flavorful peppers used in many cuisines around the world. They belong to the genus Capsicum, which includes bell peppers, jalapenos, and habaneros. Research highlights capsaicin, the main bioactive compound in chili peppers, for its promising health benefits, particularly for cardiometabolic health. Evidence suggests it has the potential to help manage obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, several large-scale observational studies, including a comprehensive cross-sectional study conducted in rural China, have revealed a significant association between the frequency of spicy food intake and overall obesity. This raises the question: does consuming chili peppers decrease or increase obesity risk? To explore this, a study published in Frontiers in Nutrition examined the association between chili pepper intake and obesity risk in Americans. Similar to other observational studies, the new study found that frequent chili pepper consumption was linked to a higher body mass index (BMI) and obesity risk, especially in females and adults over 60. Despite inconsistent findings on chili peppers’ role in obesity to date, experts offer potential explanations for the conflicting results.  This study analyzed data from 6,138 American adults aged 20 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 2003 to 2006.  The researchers excluded pregnant individuals and those with missing or unreliable data regarding chili pepper consumption, BMI, and total calorie intake.  The participants self-reported demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, education, family income, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, and health conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Approximately 51% of the participants were female, and over 34% had obesity based on their BMI status. Using a food-frequency questionnaire, the NHANES surveys evaluated chili consumption frequency over the previous 12 months.  Based on their responses, researchers divided participants into 3 groups: NHANES also estimated participant’s habitual nutrient intake by collecting dietary data over at least 2 non-consecutive days and calculating their average total calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, sugars, and fibers.  After collecting data from the surveys, the researchers conducted a series of statistical analyses following the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. Their goal was to investigate the relationship between chili pepper consumption and obesity prevalence among the general adult population in the United States. The study identified significant differences in demographic and lifestyle factors, as well as obesity risk, among the three chili pepper consumption groups.  Researchers observed variations in age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, income, alcohol intake, physical activity, diabetes status, and dietary habits, while smoking and hypertension rates were similar. Although the average BMI was also similar across groups (around 28.3 to 29.0), a higher frequency of chili consumption was linked to a greater risk of obesity.  About 30% of people who rarely ate chili peppers had obesity, compared to roughly 35% of occasional chili eaters and nearly 38% of frequent chili consumers. Further analysis indicated that, on average, frequent chili eaters had BMIs 0.71 units higher than non-eaters.  The researchers’ fully adjusted analysis also showed that the group with the highest chili consumption had a 55% greater risk of obesity than non-consumers. Of all demographic and lifestyle factors, only gender notably impacted how chili consumption affected BMI. Additionally, the effects of chili consumption on obesity risk were more pronounced among women and individuals aged 60 and above. However, this was an observational study, so the researchers did not establish a causal link between chili consumption frequency and obesity risk. Capsaicin, present in chili peppers, has been widely studied for its potential anti-obesity effects.  Many studies suggest it aids in weight reduction, conflicting with the results of the present study and several other large-scale observational studies linking higher chili consumption to increased obesity risk. Medical News Today spoke with Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging and instructor in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition at Rush University, who was not involved in the study. He provided insight into how chili peppers and other spicy foods might impact the risk of obesity. He noted that chili peppers, as a standalone food, are highly nutritious, containing flavonoids and carotenoids, vitamins C, A, B6, and iron.  Holland further explained: “The nutrients, flavonoids, and other compounds like capsaicin found in chili peppers can aid in weight reduction. Capsaicin can increase lipid oxidation, improve brown fat activation (leading to more energy being burned), enhance satiety, and improve gut microbiota diversity.” Kiran Campbell, a registered dietitian nutritionist and medical nutrition advisor at Dietitian Insights, who was also not involved in the study, told MNT that chili peppers have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, potentially aiding in preventing obesity-related inflammation. “Since obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation may be linked, this suggests that the addition of chili peppers into a healthy diet may help improve or aid in preventing obesity,” she said.  According to Holland, both direct and indirect factors affected the results of the present study, with indirect factors having a greater impact.  “Specifically,” he said, “chili peppers are often consumed with high-fat, high-calorie foods, meaning that more frequent chili pepper consumption is tied to more frequent high-calorie food consumption.” He, put simply, that this leads to weight gain if more calories are consumed than burned.  Holland also highlighted that the study ignored diet quality despite available data and used a single question about chili pepper intake—without considering type, spiciness, or serving size—making the results hard to interpret.  These limitations represent a confounding bias, which “if not properly controlled, can obscure the true relationship between the variables being studied.”   “The quality of the diet, or the foods that chili peppers are consumed with, will significantly impact the outcome,” he affirmed.  The study authors suggest that “controlling chili intake frequency could potentially contribute to improved weight management in the general population.” Holland cautioned, “It is appropriate to study individual foods, food groups, and nutrients. However, it is crucial to have all the necessary information to draw accurate conclusions.”  Rather than avoiding chili peppers, experts recommend consuming chili peppers alone or within healthier recipes instead of the calorie-dense or high-fat dishes in which chili is most often used. “There is no need to eliminate chili peppers from your diet in the fear of gaining weight. Instead, look more at HOW you are using chili peppers. Alone, chili peppers are a great low-calorie vegetable that can add flavor and spice to foods and may aid in weight loss if used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise plan.” — Kiran Campbell, RDN Holland agreed, stating, “The ultimate implication here is to be mindful of what you consume with your foods.”  “Both what we consume and how it is prepared are equally important,” he concluded.  Campbell urged more long-term human studies, considering multiple confounders and examining specific categories and culinary uses of chili pepper."
2,Robby Berman,Dementia: MRI method may spot signs of dementia 9 years early,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-test-may-predict-dementia-up-to-9-years-before-diagnosis-80-accuracy,Scientists have developed a new machine learning model that can predict dementia with over 80% accuracy and up to nine years before diagnosis.,2024-06-11T07:25:00Z,"A new test can predict dementia with 82% accuracy, according to researchers at Queen Mary University of London in the U.K. Analyzing 1,111 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of people with and without dementia, the researchers produced a model using machine learning. They say it spots the telltale signs of dementia up to nine years before diagnosis. The model identifies changes in the brain’s default mode network (DMN). The DMN is active when a person is lying in an fMRI scanner, not doing anything. The DMN state is believed to play a role in daydreaming and introspection, among other activities. It is more active when a person is at rest or engaged in self-referential thought. The researchers collected the fMRI scans used in the study from the UK Biobank. The participants included 81 people who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time their scans were taken, but who developed the condition up to nine years afterward. For comparison, 1,030 people served as matched controls for the study. The researchers examined disconnects between 10 key regions within the DMN, using machine learning to construct their model. When they applied their model to medical records of the participants, they found it accurately predicted dementia within a two-year window during which is when such a diagnosis would occur. The authors of the study also looked for associations between DMN disconnectivity and various dementia risk factors. They found links between the model and social isolation — which has been linked to the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease — as well as a genetic risk for the condition. The hope is that early detection may one day provide a chance for early interventions that may forestall or prevent dementia. The study is published in Nature Mental Health. Dr. Claire Sexton, DPhil, the Alzheimer’s Association’s U.S. senior director of scientific programs and outreach, who was not involved in the study, said the DMN seems to be implicated in Alzheimer’s. “A number of studies,” she said, “have found that Alzheimer’s is associated with decreased functional connectivity within the DMN.” “This is congruent with our current knowledge of Alzheimer’s, with other characteristic brain changes known to begin years, even decades, prior to diagnosis,” said Sexton. The predictive tool is aimed at detecting all-cause dementia, not just Alzheimer’s, and dementias can be quite different, pointed out Clifford Segil, DO, neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. (He was likewise not involved in the study.) Segil explained that Alzheimer’s is a “cortical dementia with damage to the cortex of the brain, and there is vascular dementia, which is a subcortical dementia that involves damage to the white matter of the brain.” Still, pointed out the senior author of the study, Professor Charles Marshall, clinical senior lecturer in dementia in the Preventive Neurology Unit at Queen Mary, “In practice, a large majority of dementia is due to either Alzheimer’s disease on its own or mixed Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.” “We need to extend the work to show whether or not it is relevant to rarer dementias such as frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia,” Marshall told Medical News Today. The model developed by Marshall’s team tracked various sorts of activity.  “Some brain areas show reduced activity, but others show increased activity, probably as a compensatory response. We trained a machine learning tool to recognize patterns that were ‘dementia-like,’” said Marshall. In general, Segil was supportive of the continued development of new models for diagnosing cognitive problems before they manifest as symptoms, particularly in the DMN. He pointed out, however, that “one of the issues with using fMRI, similar to nuclear medicine studies used in neurology, is the reproducibility of reading these studies.” “For example,” explained Segil, “neurologists and neuro-radiologists often see the same findings when they look at structural 3T MRI scans, but fMRIs, unfortunately in clinical practice, have different readers arrive at completely different conclusions at this time.” Sexton listed three limitations she found with the current study: These factors, she said, limit the generalizability of the study’s findings. “Replication of results with standardized methods and in study populations that accurately represent the population living with, and at risk of, Alzheimer’s is crucial,” said Sexton. Early detection of cognitive issues is one vital part of helping patients, with effective treatments being the other. “If these tests pan out to have some clinical utility in the future,” said Segil, “these patients would be followed by more frequent 3T structural MRI scans to determine if there were anatomical changes that would correlate with their memory loss.” “Unfortunately, in the year 2024, even if we could target patients with early onset dementia, we do not have any neuroprotective medications to be used at this time,” Segil said. Marshall said that as such interventions are eventually developed, he hoped that “our test could be used to select the most appropriate people to go into these trials.”"
3,Hannah Flynn,Alzheimer's: Could bone marrow transplants help treat symptoms?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/young-bone-marrow-transplants-may-help-fight-alzheimers-mouse-study-suggests,A recent study in mice suggests that bone marrow transplants from younger individuals may help fight Alzheimer's disease. The research has raised many questions.,2024-06-10T17:00:00Z,"Mice that received bone marrow transplants from younger mice as part of a recent study had lower levels of many signs of brain aging.  Not only did they have lower levels of neuronal degeneration, they also had fewer behavioral deficits and lower levels of amyloid-beta, the peptide that characterizes Alzheimer’s disease, in their brains.  Researchers from the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China hypothesized that younger hematopoietic stem cells, the stem cells in the bone marrow that make different types of blood cells, could help to counter some of the signs of aging, when transplanted into older mice. Their results appear in Science Advances.  The researchers decided to explore this avenue because previous studies had shown that, as people age, the diversity of their hematopoietic — blood cell-generating — stem cells drops, through a mechanism known as clonal hematopoiesis. Stem cells with mutations that drive proliferation dominate the stem cell population, thus reducing its overall diversity. This has a particular effect on the diversity of the immune cells the body can produce, and some researchers believe it may be one of the reasons why older people become less likely to be able to stave off infection.  In this instance, the researchers looked at the effect of bone marrow transplants on the brain and Alzheimer’s disease markers. This was pertinent as Alzheimer’s disease is a disease of aging, Rizwan Bashir, MD, a neurologist at Acia Orthopedics, and not involved in the current research, told Medical News Today. He explained: “Alzheimer’s disease is predominantly a disease of aging because it is strongly associated with the biological changes that occur as we grow older. As we age, there is a natural decline in brain function due to the accumulation of cellular damage, oxidative stress, and reduced efficiency in clearing metabolic waste.“ “This progressive decline can lead to the buildup of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles, which are hallmark features of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, the brain’s ability to repair itself diminishes with age, making it more susceptible to neurodegenerative processes,” he continued. To investigate the relationship between age of hematopoietic stem cells and brain aging, and whether or not a bone marrow transplant can restore them, researchers used 9- and 2-month-old mice that had been genetically engineered to model Alzheimer’s disease. They made two groups of 9 month old mice, and gave one group bone marrow transplants from 2 month old mice, and a control group bone marrow transplants from other, 9 month old mice.  They first compared the expression of genes in older and younger mice, and identified a number of age-related genes that were either up or down-regulated in the older mice.  Up-regulated aging pathways identified in the older mice were commonly associated with mitochondrial function, and down-regulated aging pathways were commonly associated with epigenetic regulation and immune processes. Dysfunctions in mitochondria, the so-called powerhouses of the cell, have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, as have certain epigenetic changes, which are changes in gene expression triggered by a person’s environments and lifestyle factors. Ultimately, researchers found the expression of these genes was restored after bone marrow transplant. T-cells and monocytes, two types of immune cells, were most affected by the bone marrow transplant. Researchers also compared the expression of the top 45 Alzheimer’s disease risk genes in the different types of immune cell. They found that the top 10 Alzheimer’s disease risk genes were differentially expressed in a type of white blood cell called monocytes in older mice, and young bone marrow transplant reversed these expression changes. In particular, bone marrow transplant restored the ability of monocytes to eliminate amyloid-beta build up, reducing cerebral and plasma amyloid-beta levels in the 9-month-old mice that had received a bone marrow transplant with the bone marrow of younger mice.  These mice also displayed lower neuroinflammation (brain inflammation) and neuronal (brain cell) loss. Furthermore, behavior relating to cognition improved in the older mice following bone marrow transplant.  Zachary Harvanek, MD, PhD, instructor of psychiatry at Yale, who researches aging and was not involved in the research told MNT that the bone marrow transplant appeared to be having an effect on the whole body. “It seems the young bone marrow transplant is improving the function of the immune system both systemically and in the brain. The immune system appears to play an important role in clearing the plaques in the brain which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, and this study suggests that a bone marrow transplant might help clear these plaques by rejuvenating the immune system,” he noted. Attempting to translate the procedure to humans was fraught with ethical problems, Harvanek cautioned, noting that, “[w]ith what we know now, performing bone marrow transplants on otherwise healthy humans to investigate the prevention of aging-related diseases is far too risky.“ “The use of young, allogenic donors for proposed interventions on aging such as heterochronic parabiosis or bone marrow transplants, would be fraught with ethical concerns regarding equity and exploitation, conjuring up dystopian future images of billionaire ‘vampires’ obtaining young blood or bone marrow to keep themselves young,“ said the researcher.  “One way to avoid this would be to use heterochronic autologous transplants, that is, taking your blood or bone marrow from an earlier age and then transplanting it back into yourself, which might show similar effects. However, if research can identify the specific aspects of these transplants that affects the aging process — for example, serum blood proteins seem to be important in heterochronic parabiosis — then the benefits might be obtained without a transplant at all. In both of these scenarios the risk of exploitation would be diminished, though there would still be important ethical concerns regarding access to treatment.” – Zachary Harvanek, MD, PhD Still, though there were risks, bone marrow transplants were a well defined, ultimately safe treatment for the people who needed them to treat illness, Harvanek admitted.

4,Robby Berman,ADHD: Stimulant and non-stimulant drugs may improve cognitive function,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/adhd-medications-improve-long-term-cognitive-function,"A new study found that stimulant and non-stimulant medications prescribed for ADHD improve cognitive function in people with the condition. The researchers examined the long-term effects of both types of drugs, and concluded these medications offered similar …",2024-06-12T15:36:43Z,"Common medicines for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) promote cognitive function, according to new research. The results show that ADHD medications improve attention, inhibition, reaction time, and working memory, four key cognitive functions. The researchers explored two types of ADHD medications that may be prescribed long-term: methylphenidate represented ADHD stimulants and atomoxetine represented non-stimulants. Included in the meta-study were 20 methylphenidate clinical tests lasting at least a week, and eight tests of atomoxetine lasting at least three weeks. Overall, the study authors found that chronic use of both medications produced generally similar cognitive benefits. ADHD is associated with cognitive impairment to varying degrees. The findings of this study offer encouragement that ADHD medications could support cognitive function in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD. The study is published in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews. Both stimulant and non-stimulant ADHD medications showed improvements across all cognitive domains with the exception of atomoxetine, which did not show an effect on working memory. Menka Gupta, MD, a functional medicine doctor at Nutra Nourish, not involved in the study, explained to Medical News Today: “Stimulants enhance dopamine and norepinephrine levels — which are crucial for attention and executive function — by blocking their reuptake. Non-stimulants also support cognitive function, but through different pathways; either by selectively inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake or by modulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the prefrontal cortex.” David Merrill, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist and director of the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Pacific Brain Health Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved with the new research, told MNT:  “Both types of medications improve cognitive functions like attention and working memory by optimizing neurotransmitter levels and enhancing brain network connectivity.” The cognitive benefits reported in the study suggest that an adult with ADHD may benefit from taking medications through adulthood. “ADHD is a chronic condition, and while symptoms may change over time, it typically does not go away,” Merrill said. “The decision to remain on medication should be individualized, taking into account the severity of symptoms, functional impairment, and side effects. Some adults may benefit from continuous medication, while others might manage symptoms through behavioral strategies or intermittent medication use,” Merrill explained.” — David A. Merrill, MD, PhD, geriatric psychiatrist ADHD is is prominently diagnosed in childhood, although adults may receive diagnoses as well.  This neurodivergent condition is characterized by hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity. With hyperactivity, a person is continually moving and seemingly unable to stay still. With impulsivity, an individual may act without careful foresight. The inattention component of ADHD involves being readily distracted and having a short attention span, as well as having difficulty following through on complex tasks.  Gupta explained that children with ADHD “may fidget, interrupt others frequently, and struggle to complete tasks.” “Adults with ADHD, experience chronic disorganization, poor time management, and difficulty prioritizing tasks. They may feel restless, easily distracted, and find it challenging to maintain focus during meetings or day-to-day conversations,” Gupta said. Merrill noted adults with ADHD may experience difficulty “with time management, organization, maintaining focus, and following through on tasks.” Jasmin Dao, MD, PhD, a pediatric neurologist at Miller Children’s & Women’s Hospital, Long Beach, CA, also not involved in the study, told MNT that hyperactivity often develops around 4 years of age. “It peaks at 7 to 8 years old, and then when you get into adolescent years, that hyperactivity tends to go away a little bit more,” Dao said. While impulsivity is usually prominent during childhood, it may last into adulthood. Dao said this is the most common ADHD trait seen in adults, and it may negatively impact a person’s social skills. There appear to be a few reasons ADHD symptoms may become less severe as a person ages. One is the maturation of the brain that occurs from adolescence to early adult, Dao said. “During the childhood and adolescent years, the brain is going through a very intense rewiring and pruning process,” she explained. “The choices you make when you’re a teenager you don’t necessarily make when you’re an adult because you kind of learned certain pathways and your prefrontal cortex is more solidified,” Dao noted. Dao cited an example of how experience helps many people with ADHD assist in the rewiring: “An adult with ADHD has learned, ‘OK, I have a lot of tasks I need to do — I’ll just write them down and checkbox them, so they develop coping skills and executive function.’” It is not entirely clear what causes ADHD, but several factors are likely involved and may impact one another. Since ADHD runs in families, there can be a genetic component to the condition. Another likely factor, Dao said, “is just how your brain is structured and formed and the network that makes. A lot of studies show that certain areas of the brain and people with ADHD are smaller or bigger than people who don’t have ADHD.” Dao noted that differences may include “your prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive function, your basal ganglia, which is involved in motor planning. Your reward systems and limbic areas are all different in people with ADHD.” “Then, the brain is also chemically different. We know that, and that’s probably more important because that’s where the drugs’ target is,” Dao explained. “A simple way of thinking of it is we know that dopamine and noradrenaline [norepinephrine] levels are low in patients with ADHD,” she added. Dopamine is typically associated with happiness and reward.  “I think that’s a large part of it, from the impulsivity standpoint, you know, getting those rewards hits. The other part is dopamine, [which] is a big part of your basal ganglia with things like movement and hyperactivity. So it’s kind of like this feedback inhibition loop.” — Jasmin Dao, MD, PhD, pediatric neurologist"
5,Jessica Freeborn,Alzheimer's: 4 lifestyle changes may help improve or prevent decline,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/4-lifestyle-changes-may-improve-cognitive-function-slow-alzheimers,New research found that four lifestyle interventions may help improve or prevent cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.,2024-06-13T15:02:36Z,"Receiving a dementia diagnosis can be devastating and discouraging. However, experts are determined to figure out how to best help people with Alzheimer’s disease, and recent research in this area is hopeful. A recent study published in Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy examined how intensive lifestyle interventions can help people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.  In a 20-week intervention, researchers found that combining lifestyle interventions like following a plant-based diet, exercising, managing stress, and attending group support meetings may help improve cognitive function. The results point to potential intervention paths to help people with early dementia or interventions to possibly prevent dementia.  Alzheimer’s disease is a condition that results in brain changes and impacts over six million people in the United States alone. People with Alzheimer’s disease often experience a progressive decline in their cognitive function and memory. They may struggle with memory loss, personality changes, and declines in judgment. Alzheimer’s disease is also the most common dementia type, making it a particularly important area for research focus. Shannel Kassis Elhelou, Psy.D., geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the study, noted the following about Alzheimer’s disease to Medical News Today: “Alzheimer’s disease significantly impacts quality of life and function through progressive declines in memory, cognitive functioning (attention, processing speed, problem-solving, word finding), tasks of daily living (managing finances, driving, medication management, household duties), as well as changes in mood (increased irritability, anxiety, depression, or apathy).” “Over time, Alzheimer’s disease leads to declines in physical health, reducing mobility and increasing the risk of falls. Overall, these effects result in social isolation and substantial caregiver burden, further impacting the individual and caregivers’ quality of life,” Elhelou said. There are medications that help people with Alzheimer’s disease, but experts are also interested in how lifestyle interventions can also help. These lifestyle interventions were the focus of the current study. For the current study, researchers wanted to examine if a combination of non-medication interventions could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. This study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial that included fifty-one participants. All participants had mild cognitive impairment or early dementia from Alzheimer’s disease. The average age for participants was 73.5 years. Researchers excluded participants who had moderate or severe dementia and those who could not participate in regular exercise. Researchers divided participants into two groups. The control group received standard care, and the intervention group received standard care and took part in four key lifestyle interventions: Overall, the intervention period lasted 20 weeks, and two participants from the intervention group withdrew. Researchers provided intervention participants with food, assistance with exercise, supervision of stress management techniques, and access to support group meetings. Researchers used several measurements to assess the success of the interventions, including four assessment tools: the AD assessment Scale—cognitive Subscale, Clinical Global Impression of Change, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Clinical Dementia Rating Global. They also examined certain biomarkers and microbiome taxa.  The control group showed declines in all four assessments of cognition and function. In contrast, the intervention group showed improvement in three of the assessments. In the last assessment, the intervention group showed less progression than the control group.  In addition, the intervention group showed improvement in microbiome configuration and improvement in clinically relevant biomarkers compared to controls. Study author Dean Ornish, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, noted the following highlights of the research to Medical News Today: “What makes our research unique is that it’s the first time a randomized controlled clinical trial has demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention, without drugs, significantly improved cognition and function after 20 weeks in many patients with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease.” “There was a statistically significant dose-response correlation between the degree of lifestyle changes in both groups and the degree of change in most measures of cognition and function testing. In short, the more these patients changed their lifestyle in the prescribed ways, the greater was the beneficial impact on their cognition and function.”— Dean Ornish, study author While the results don’t mean that everyone in the intervention group experienced an improvement in cognition, they do mark superior outcomes to standard care interventions. Ornish noted that “Not all patients in the intervention group improved; in the CGIC test, 71% improved or were unchanged. In contrast, none of the patients in the control group improved, eight were unchanged, and 17 (68%) worsened.” Should future research confirm these findings, the interventions could see greater emphasis as a way to help people with early Alzheimer’s disease. It may also have implications for Alzheimer’s disease prevention. This research does have several limitations.  First, it included a fairly small sample size, so it could help to replicate the findings with larger groups, and the results cannot be generalized. Researchers were also unable to include certain individuals in the intervention, such as those who didn’t have a caregiver who could help with study adherence.  Since the research focused on Alzheimer’s disease, it’s also unclear how the interventions would help individuals with other dementia types. Researchers note the increased likelihood of a type II error in certain measurements related to ethnic and racial diversity.  The study is also limited by its design, such as how it was not double-blinded. Researchers also did not conduct brain structure measurements, which could have given an even better picture of the results. The intervention period lasted only 20 weeks, so future research could have more extended intervention and follow-up times and include more diversity among study participants. The interventions were also complex, making it not entirely clear if any of them are superior in how they help people with Alzheimer’s disease.  In addition, some data relied on participant reporting, which is not the most accurate data collection method. The researchers acknowledge that some participants may have been better able to adhere to the intervention, which may have been why these participants saw improved cognition. The researchers also acknowledge that “The findings on the degree of lifestyle change required to stop the worsening or improve cognition and function need to be interpreted with caution. Since data from both groups were combined, it was no longer a randomized trial for this specific analysis, so there could be unknown confounding influences.” However, the results still offer hope for people and their loved ones who are impacted by Alzheimer’s disease and point to more extensive research in the future. Elhelou noted the following: “I hope to see more providers discussing this information with their patients and I am enthusiastic about future research in this area. These findings underscore the potential of non-pharmacological interventions in the treatment of MCI [mild cognitive impairment] and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Ongoing research can further support their ability to influence healthcare guidelines by promoting lifestyle modifications as a crucial strategy for slowing the progression of MCI and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.”"
6,Corrie Pelc,Heart disease: How plant-based ultra-processed foods may raise risk,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/plant-based-ultra-processed-foods-heart-disease-mortality-risk,A new study suggests that consuming plant-based ultra-processed foods may lead to increased risks of cardiovascular disease and early death.,2024-06-14T14:44:40Z,"About 58% of a typical Western diet includes ultra-processed foods — foods made entirely through industrial processes. Examples of ultra-processed foods include ice cream, sports drinks, mass-produced packaged breads, and margarine.  Recent studies have linked higher ultra-processed food consumption to an increased risk for health conditions such as cognitive decline, depression, and cancer.  For instance, research published in February found that greater intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increased risk for 32 adverse health outcomes, including heart issues, sleeping problems, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, and mental health conditions.  Now, a study recently published in The Lancet Regional Health — Europe suggests that consuming plant-based ultra-processed foods can also be bad for your health, potentially leading to increased cardiovascular disease and mortality risks.  Despite these implications, this is an observational study, which means it does not establish causality. More research is needed on the long-term health impacts of plant-based ultra-processed foods. For this study, researchers focused on plant-based ultra-processed foods due to the lack of comprehensive research on how these products affect health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular disease.  Lead study author Fernanda Rauber, PhD, a researcher at the Centre for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health (NUPENS) and the Department of Preventive Medicine at the School of Medicine at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, told Medical News Today: “Plant-based foods are recommended in many dietary guidelines, and this area has been explored by the food industry, which uses health claims — vegetarian, vegan, plant-based — to promote its products. With a growing population adopting plant-based diets, studying the role of food processing in plant-based dietary patterns and its relation to cardiovascular diseases can help refine guidelines to incorporate considerations about food processing in their recommendations.”  Rauber explained the main difference between animal-based and plant-based ultra-processed foods is that plant-based ones contain mainly plant-derived ingredients, so they do not include ingredients like meat, dairy, eggs, or cheese.  “With the growing public interest in adopting plant-based diets and dietary recommendations promoting plant-based eating, the food industry often uses these recommendations for marketing,” Rauber continued.  “This can lead to the misleading perception that their products are healthy or beneficial for the planet, which is not always the case.” Rauber and her team analyzed data from almost 127,000 participants of the UK Biobank who provided dietary information between 2009 and 2012 and received a median follow-up of nine years.  Scientists discovered that for every 10% increase in calorie intake from plant-based ultra-processed foods, participants had a 5% increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 12% higher risk of death from cardiovascular diseases.  “We hypothesized that the industrial processing of foods would influence the relationship between plant-based food intake and cardiovascular disease, but we didn’t know to what extent,” Rauber said.  “We were surprised by how consistently the results showed that consuming plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods was associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease while consuming plant-sourced ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk. However, the consumption of all plant-based foods showed no association with cardiovascular disease risk,” Rauber continued. Also, during the study, researchers found that every 10 percentage point increase in calories from plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods consumed was associated with a 7% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 13% lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease.  “The higher the consumption of plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods, the lower the risk of these diseases,” Rauber explained.  “This underscores the importance of not just consuming plant-based foods, but specifically choosing those that are minimally processed to maximize health benefits. Our findings underscore the importance of not just focusing on plant-based diets, but also considering the level of processing of these foods,” she continued.  “Doctors can use this information to emphasize to their cardiovascular disease patients that while plant-based diets can be beneficial, it is crucial to limit the consumption of all ultra-processed foods, including those that are plant-based. They should explain how minimally processed plant-based foods are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, guiding patients to make healthier dietary choices.”  — Fernanda Rauber, PhD, lead study author After reviewing this study, Jennifer Wong, MD, a board certified cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told MNT that the findings are in line with diets recommended by the American Heart Association, such as the DASH diet. “Studies like these remind us that when encouraging patients to avoid animal products high in saturated fat and seek more plant-based options, [we should] also bring up the importance of seeking whole foods and avoid processed packaged foods even if plant-based,” Wong continued.  “I’d be curious to see if there would be a difference in outcomes based on different types of processed foods like those eating processed foods with lower fat content of any type or lower salt and sugar have better outcomes,” Wong said. MNT also spoke with Monique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, who said she was not surprised by the observations linking those who consumed more non-ultra-processed plant-based foods with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and those who consumed plant-based ultra-processed foods with a higher risk.  “Marketing messages can often be confusing for the general public,” Richard explained. “If they understand something to be made of plants and understand that they are encouraged to eat more, they may perceive it is healthier than the animal counterpart.”  “’Plant-based’ does not automatically equate to nutritious. Often, meat analogs and ultra-processed foods have added sugar, salt, fat, cholesterol, [and] preservatives, or [they] are so processed that they no longer include the original beneficial components such as fiber or the phytochemicals and water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, folate, or riboflavin,” Richard continued.  “If consumed in excess, there is a potential that these ingredients can also lead to increased risk of cardiometabolic markers such as elevated LDL, low HDL, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein or advanced glycation end products.” — Monique Richard, registered dietitian nutritionist Richard said choosing whole food or whole food ingredients when possible will allow you to glean the most health benefits of plant-based foods. “Think about applesauce — it literally is made from mashed apples, but the fiber is mechanically altered, sugar is often added, and it often does not include skin, which depreciates its nutritiousness further,” she explained.  “The benefits of the apple in its entirety have now been reduced from the whole food to another product. With each step of processing and manipulating, the integrity of the entire package is compromised. Does that mean applesauce is not good for us? No. This simply is an illustration of the varying degrees [a] food’s nutritional value can change,” Richard noted. For those looking for healthier options to plant-based ultra-processed foods, Richard suggested these swaps: "
7,Hannah Flynn,Can we harness gut bacteria to fight heart disease and aging?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/the-gut-microbiome-could-affect-cardiovascular-health-and-how-we-age,"Researchers in China have shown that metabolic health is linked to the presence and abundance of certain microbes in the gut microbiome, suggesting that the latter could be a promising target for therapies against cardiovascular disease and aging processes.",2024-06-15T06:00:00Z,"Scientists have characterized the way age and metabolism can present in the microbiome.  Researchers in China developed an age-related and metabolism-related microbial signature based on findings from investigations in a cohort of over 10,000 Chinese people, and verified it on a cohort of over 9,000 Chinese people.  They then looked at the impacts these signatures had on cardiovascular disease risk.  The researchers published their results in Nature Medicine. The gut microbiome is the population of bacteria, viruses and other microbes, playing a role in digestion, but also in other processes, including nerve signaling, immune response and hormones.  Yoshua Quinones, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan, NY, not involved in this research, explained to Medical News Today: “The microbiome affects cardiovascular disease risk by producing metabolites like TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide) and SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), modulating inflammation and immune responses, influencing lipid and glucose metabolism, regulating blood pressure, and altering cholesterol absorption […] As we age, changes in our immune system, diet, lifestyle, and gut function alter the gut microbiome. This leads to fewer different types of bacteria and changes in how they work, affecting our overall health and risk of diseases.” First, the researchers looked at a cohort of 10,207 Chinese participants, collecting information on 21 metabolic parameters to classify individuals into five “metabolic multimorbidity clusters” clusters. These were: They then looked at the impact of being in one of these clusters on overall cardiovascular disease risk over an average follow-up of 11.1 years. They discovered that people in the obesity and hyperglycemia clusters were 75% and 117%, respectively, more likely to develop cardiovascular disease when compared to the healthy cluster. The MC1, MC2, and MC3 clusters were all linked to “healthy” parameters, while MC4 and MC5 were associated with “unhealthy” parameters. These results were then validated in a cohort of 9,061 individuals, with a 10-year follow-up.  Researchers then looked at the gut microbiome of 4,491 participants from the original cohort, and sequenced the genomes of the microbes found there, to identify the presence and abundance of particular species.  They discovered that the microbiomes of people they assigned to the metabolic multimorbidity clusters had certain overlapping characteristics. They also characterized the species that were found in the microbiome of younger people and older people. They then plotted the presence of 55 age-related microbial species against age to develop a gut microbial age metric, which they then validated using existing cross-sectional data from Israel, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom and United States.  The microbiomes of younger people were associated with lower levels of Bacteroides species and older people had higher levels of Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae species.  The study authors also pointed at microbial variation between individuals in different countries, and stated this could be an area for further research. Further analysis showed that a younger microbial age was associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk.  The authors have argued this could mean the microbiome could be a target for cardiovascular disease prevention in older adults who are not metabolically healthy. Catherine Rall, RDN, a registered dietitian based in Denver, CO, and certified nutritionist at Happy V, who was not involved in the research, told Medical News Today that: “The results of this study show a strong correlation between poor gut microbiome health and an increased risk of morbidity-related conditions like cardiovascular issues. This suggests that a healthy gut microbiome can help to limit the impacts of aging on the body, becoming even more important in helping people stay healthy as they age.“ “While there is some merit to the idea that microbiome health can correlate effectively with someone’s biological age, our gut microbiomes are also highly changeable through prebiotic and probiotic supplementation and potentially even more extreme measures like fecal transplantation,“ she noted. “I wouldn’t say that this represents our ability to reverse aging, but it can definitely help to improve health outcomes in people as they age,” said Rall. The findings of this research are backed up by evidence from other studies, which have shown that gut dysbiosis — imbalance of bacterial populations in the gut — is associated with a range of inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematous, but also cardiovascular disease. There are also links between those conditions, including IBD, and cardiovascular disease.  The authors of this study looked at heart attack, stroke, and death related to cardiovascular events, but other studies have linked gut dysbiosis to a range of cardiovascular risk factors, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. However, the core question remains: Does dysbiosis cause these problems or do these conditions cause dysbiosis? "
8,Jessica Freeborn,"Statins may help prevent some forms of cancer, study finds",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-statins-help-prevent-cancer,"A recent study found that using the statin pitavastatin may assist in blocking a particular protein's action to suppress chronic inflammation. The findings suggest that statin therapy could potentially prevent inflammatory-related cancers, particularly pancre…",2024-06-08T18:25:28Z,"Cancer prevention is a major field of research, and experts are continuing to learn more about what factors may contribute to cancer development.  One area of interest is how chronic inflammation in certain areas of the body may contribute to cancer risk. A recent study published in Nature Communications examined some of the pathways involved in developing chronic inflammation.  The results suggest the statin drug pitavastatin could help suppress chronic inflammation and prevent pancreatic cancer development. If future research confirms the findings, this drug could be a preventive measure in clinical practice.  Statins are typically prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels in people whose “bad” cholesterol levels are too high.  Statins can be used in combination with lifestyle changes to help keep cholesterol in a healthy range. For example, people may minimize their saturated fat intake and increase their physical activity levels. Non-study author Dr. Robert Salazar, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann, explained the following to Medical News Today: “Statins are typically used to manage high cholesterol in patients at elevated risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD.) Generally speaking, a statin is started when a patient’s individual risk of heart attacks, strokes or peripheral arterial disease is high. Statin medications are also started when measured blood cholesterol levels are high or after a stroke or heart attack. The effectiveness of statin drugs is then checked using a follow up blood cholesterol level to ensure an adequate response.” Alternative uses for statins for other health conditions are an ongoing area of research. Researchers of the current study note that chronic inflammation contributes to cancer development.  Several inflammatory conditions contribute to an increased cancer risk. For example, chronic pancreatitis (an inflammation of the pancreas) raises the risk of pancreatic cancer. The researchers of the current study note that interleukin 33 (IL-33) is one protein that helps initiate cancer-prone chronic inflammation. They wanted to understand more about the underlying mechanisms involved in this relationship and whether there was a way to alter it. Researchers utilized mice, human tissue samples, and cell lines. They induced chronic inflammation in mice on the skin and in the pancreas. They found that IL-33 was highly expressed in the inflamed skin and pancreas. Based on further analysis, they identified that inflammation induction activated a specific signaling pathway called TLR3/4, suggesting that this pathway may cause the IL-33 expression that occurs in chronic inflammation. They further identified another cellular mechanism, TBK1-IRF3, regulating IL-33 expression in chronic pancreatitis and dermatitis in mice. Researchers then tested the use of pitavastatin to block IL-33 expression. Their work suggests that pitavastatin may successfully block IL-33 expression and, thus, the related chronic pancreatitis. While looking at human tissue samples, they further confirmed that the IRF3-IL-33 signaling axis is active when the pancreas is inflamed and in cases of pancreatic cancer. Finally, researchers looked at electronic health records from over 200 million people to look at the use of pitavastatin and the risk for pancreatic cancer. Researchers found that people taking pitavastatin were at a decreased risk for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Study author Shadmehr Demehri, MD, PhD, explained the key findings of the research to MNT: “15–20% cancer death worldwide relate to cancers that develop in the context of chronic inflammation. We set out to determine what factor initiates the development of chronic inflammation in various organs. Based on our discovery that an immune factor, called interleukin 33, is the driver of cancer-prone chronic inflammation, we investigated the cellular mechanism that regulates the expression of this immune factor. Our findings, reported in the current publication, reveal this mechanism and demonstrate how [a] statin drug can block this immune factor expression in experimental models and prevent chronic inflammation and cancer in them. Interestingly, we find statin use by patients (to treat high cholesterol) associates with reduced risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas) and reduced risk of pancreatic cancer.” The study demonstrates another potential use for statins in the future. Salazar noted the following: “This study and its findings are quite compelling in demonstrating additional benefits from statin drugs that are independent of cholesterol levels. In particular, lowering inflammation further protects patients from negative outcomes including heart attacks, strokes, dementia, autoimmune disease, premature aging and cancer.” This preliminary research requires more research before these concepts can reach practical clinical application.  Since it relied on components like mouse models, it’s not perfectly clear how the data applies to humans. The research from patient health records was also from North America and Europe, so more diversity may be needed in this research area. “It is critical to examine statin efficacy for cancer prevention in chronic inflammation directly in patients through clinical trials,” Demehri said.  “We also aim to extend our work to encompass the array of chronic inflammatory diseases that render patients prone to cancer (e.g., ulcerative colitis and hepatitis) to help prevent cancer in all patients affected by chronic inflammation.” If future research continues to confirm the findings, it could benefit clinical practice. Non-study author Anton Bilchik, MD, PhD, surgical oncologist, chief of medicine, and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, noted the following to MNT: “The findings are very provocative because pancreas cancer is a deadly cancer with limited treatment options. If the anti-inflammatory effect of statins can reduce the chance of developing pancreas cancer particularly in high risk patients this will be practice changing and play an important role not only in reducing the risk of heart attacks but also in cancer prevention.”"
9,Tony Hicks,Heart health: Sugar substitute xylitol linked to higher risk of stroke,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/sugar-substitute-xylitol-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-attack-stroke,"Researchers say there appears to be links between the artificial sweetener xylitol, a type of sugar alcohol, and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke",2024-06-07T09:33:00Z,"An artificial sweetener known as sugar alcohol has never sounded like the healthiest thing for people. Turns out, it may not be. In a study published in the European Heart Journal, Cleveland Clinic researchers report that higher amounts of xylitol, a type of sugar alcohol, can increase risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular events. The researchers said they found the associations in a large-scale patient analysis, a clinical intervention study, and preclinical research models. Xylitol is a lower-calorie sugar substitute with a low glycemic index. Sugar alcohols are carbohydrates that don’t actually contain alcohol. Xylitol occurs naturally in small amounts in fibrous fruits and vegetables, corn cobs, trees, and the human body. It’s used as a sugar substitute because its taste is comparable to sugar but has fewer calories.  Xylitol is found in many products, ranging from sugar-free candy and gum to toothpaste. People also use it as a sweetener and for baking. The research team said over the past decade, sugar substitutes such as sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners have significantly increased in processed foods promoted as healthy alternatives.  The Cleveland Clinic team found a similar link between another sugar alcohol, erythritol, and cardiovascular risk last year. They said in a statement that xylitol isn’t as common as erythritol in keto or sugar-free products in the United States, but they noted it is common in other countries. “This study again shows the immediate need for investigating sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners, especially as they continue to be recommended in combating conditions like obesity or diabetes,” said Dr. Stanley Hazen, the chairperson of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences at Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute as well as the co-section head of preventive cardiology in the Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute, in the statement.  “It does not mean throw out your toothpaste if it has xylitol in it, but we should be aware that consumption of a product containing high levels could increase the risk of blood clot related events,” Hazen added. In an analysis of more than 3,000 subjects in the United States and Europe, the researchers reported that high levels of circulating xylitol were associated with an elevated three-year risk of cardiovascular events. A third of subjects with the highest amount of xylitol in their plasma were found more likely to experience a cardiovascular event. The team conducted pre-clinical testing to confirm the findings. They discovered xylitol caused clotting in platelets and heightened risk of thrombosis.  The researchers also tracked platelet activity from subjects who ingested a xylitol-sweetened drink versus a glucose-sweetened drink. They found every measure of clotting ability significantly increased immediately following ingestion of xylitol but not glucose.  The team said the study had several limitations, including that clinical observation studies demonstrate association and not causation. They said more studies are needed to assess the long-term cardiovascular safety of xylitol. Dr. Cheng-Han Chen, an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the structural heart program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in California, told Medical News Today that people should consider avoiding large amounts of xylitol until its effects are better understood. “Based on this study, it is thought that xylitol affects the ‘stickiness’ of platelets in the bloodstream, potentially increasing the risk of forming a blood clot in the heart or in the brain,” said Chen, who was not involved in the research. Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar, a consultative cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told Medical News Today it’s important to remember the study was observational and doesn’t definitively prove xylitol directly causes cardiovascular problems. “However, the findings raise enough concern to warrant further investigation,” Tadwalkar, who was not involved in the research, said. “This new study adds another chapter to the evolving story of sugar substitutes and heart health. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness that these alternatives might not be as risk-free as once believed.” Tadwalkar added it’s also important to note erythritol is more prominent in the United States within keto and sugar-free products, whereas xylitol finds wider use in other countries as well as in some sugar-free candies and chewing gums. “This new research prompts consideration of the long-term cardiovascular safety of various sugar substitutes,” Tadwalkar said. “This new study on xylitol has significant implications for both consumers and healthcare professionals.” He added that xylitol may have this impact on the heart because, according to the study, xylitol may increase platelet activity and enhance blood clot formation. “This heightened activity could raise the risk of clots forming unexpectedly, potentially leading to cardiovascular events like heart attack or stroke,” Tadwalkar said. “It is important to note, however, that this is ultimately just a theory. More research is needed to definitively understand the exact biological processes at play. Dr. Bradley Serwer, a cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, which provides cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, told Medical News Today that problems with sugar substitutes go back more than a century. “Saccharin was first discovered in 1879 and widely introduced as an artificial sweetener in the early 20th century,” Serwer said. “There was notable concern that saccharin could cause cancer in the 1970s, but this was later clarified in the early 2000s when the National Toxicology Program removed saccharin from its list of potential carcinogens. Serwer said the health value of sugar substitutes depends on someone’s medical conditions. “Ideally, one would avoid them altogether and maintain a healthy balanced diet with a low glycemic index,” said Serwer, who was not involved in the research. “I would encourage patients to consider their desire for sweets over their overall health. The natural options such as monk fruit extract may be reasonable.”  “Take caution. Even products such as Stevia, which is derived from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, is mixed with erythritol, which may also increase the risk of platelet clumping and was associated with higher cardiovascular events,” he added."
10,Bob Curley,How stress can undermine cognitive benefits of an active lifestyle,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-can-affect-your-cognitive-reserve-what-that-means-for-dementia-risk,"Researchers say stress can impair a person's cognitive reserve and undermine the benefits of an active lifestyle and social interaction. Mindfulness and meditation can help relieve stress, experts note.",2024-06-07T09:08:00Z,"Stress can undermine lifestyle factors known to improve cognition among people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, according to a new research. In a study published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden report that the cognitive benefits associated with stimulating and rewarding life experiences can be reduced by physiological and psychological stress. “These results might have clinical implications as an expanding body of research suggests that mindfulness exercises and meditation may reduce cortisol levels and improve cognition,” said Manasa Shanta Yerramalla, PhD, a a lead study author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute’s Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, in a statement. “Different stress management strategies could be a good complement to existing lifestyle interventions in Alzheimer’s prevention.” Past studies have shown that strong cognitive reserve index (CRI) scores seem to have a protective benefit against cognitive decline among people with Alzheimer’s disease. These CRI scores are tabulated through cognitively stimulating and enriching life experiences as well as factors such as higher educational attainment, complex jobs, continued physical and leisure activities, and healthy social interactions. In the latest research, the association among CRI scores, cognition, and biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease in 113 participants from the memory clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital was examined alongside levels of perceived stress in combination with biomarkers for psychological stress, namely cortisol levels in saliva. The study concluded that while higher CRI scores were associated with better cognition, adjusting for cortisol measures reduced this beneficial association. Higher CRI scores also were associated with better working memory in individuals with healthier cortisol levels, but not among individuals with cortisol levels that indicated a high level of psychological stress. Dr. Logan DuBose, a resident physician at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and the chief operating officer at the elder-care company Olera who was not involved in the new study, told Medical News Today that “chronic stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors including caregiving responsibilities, can lead to elevated cortisol levels. This can damage the hippocampus — the center of the brain associated with memory formation — and negate the benefits of cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity, potentially worsening dementia symptoms.” A complex occupation such as a pilot, medical professional, or financial analyst might help build a cognitive reserve, noted Irv Seldin, the owner and chief executive officer of the eldercare company Visiting Angels, ”but the high levels of persistent stress from these professions can also lead to the increase of cortisol levels… which can implicate an increased risk of dementia.” “In order to maintain healthy cognitive functions, people in these complicated professions must maintain stress management strategies such as meditation, physical exercise or therapy in order to reduce the risk of furthering cognitive decline,” Seldin, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “Stress reduction is a well-known approach to management of symptoms and behaviors associated with Alzheimer’s disease. We teach our caregivers to create a quiet, tranquil environment to keep our clients calm.” “Engaging in mentally stimulating activities can help strengthen neural pathways and improve memory, problem-solving, and communication skills in people with cognitive decline,” added Angela Morrell, a speech-language pathologist at Georgetown University Hospital. “For example, language-based activities like storytelling, word games, or discussions on current events can be great tools… to use with memory clinic patients.” “The impact of stress on cognition is important to consider,” Morrell, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “Chronic stress can negatively affect memory and communication in people with dementia. As speech-language pathologists, we often incorporate stress management techniques into our therapy plans, such as relaxation exercises or mindfulness practices. Additionally, understanding how best to manage stress alongside cognitive stimulation programs would be valuable … in creating personalized treatment plans with the goal of improving the quality of life for people with dementia.” The new study was limited by its small sample size and the fact that lack of sleep — known to impair cognition — was not thoroughly controlled other than to ascertain whether participants took sleep medications."
11,"Paul Ian Cross, PhD",Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome occurs in 15% of cases,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/1-in-6-people-who-stop-antidepressants-face-withdrawal-symptoms,New research confirms that one in every six to seven people who discontinue antidepressant medication experience withdrawal symptoms and require support.,2024-06-10T16:00:00Z,"According to a systematic review and meta-analysis recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry, there is a 15% chance — or roughly one in six to seven people — of experiencing discontinuation symptoms, also known as withdrawal symptoms, when stopping antidepressants. The analysis also found that severe discontinuation symptoms, which might cause patients to drop out of a study or resume taking antidepressants, occurred in about 3% — or one in 35 — of those who stopped the medication. The researchers emphasize that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of antidepressants for many individuals with depressive disorders, either alone or in combination with other treatments like psychotherapy.  However, these medications do not work for everyone and can cause unpleasant side effects for some patients. For those who have recovered with the aid of antidepressants, doctors and patients may decide to discontinue their use over time. Therefore, it is important for both doctors and patients to have a clear, evidence-based understanding of what might occur when antidepressants are stopped. Their study confirms that many people will experience discontinuation symptoms when they stop taking antidepressants, with a few experiencing more severe symptoms. It should be noted that these discontinuation symptoms are not due to antidepressants being addictive. There is a critical need for individuals discontinuing antidepressants to be counselled, monitored and supported by healthcare professionals. However, their findings, which consolidate data from numerous studies, should reassure that the rates of discontinuation symptoms are not as high as some previous individual studies and reviews have suggested. Previous studies have estimated that more than half of patients experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping antidepressants, with half of these symptoms being severe. Yet many of these estimates are based on observational studies, which cannot reliably determine cause and effect. In contrast, well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where one group receives a placebo and the other group receives the medication, can more accurately identify symptoms directly caused by the medication versus non-specific symptoms influenced by patients’ or practitioners’ expectations. The aim of this study was to review all available evidence to determine the likely incidence of discontinuation symptoms directly caused by stopping antidepressants, the probable incidence of severe symptoms and the differences between various types of antidepressants. The researchers conducted a review and meta-analysis of 79 trials (44 RCTs and 35 observational studies), which included data from 21,002 individuals — 16,532 discontinuing antidepressants and 4,470 discontinuing from placebo. The average age of the participants was 45 years, with 72% being women. The analysis revealed that 31% of individuals who stopped taking an antidepressant experienced at least one symptom, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, insomnia or irritability. Severe symptoms occurred in about 3%, or one in 35 people. Stopping imipramine (Tofranil), paroxetine (Paxil or Seroxat), and venlafaxine (Effexor)/ desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) was associated with a higher risk of severe symptoms compared to other antidepressants. In randomised controlled trials, 17% of participants experienced discontinuation-like symptoms when stopping a placebo, suggesting that approximately half of the symptoms in those stopping antidepressants might be due to negative expectations — the so-called nocebo effect — or nonspecific symptoms that could occur in the general population. Joao L. de Quevedo, MD, PhD, a psychiatrist at UTHealth Houston, not involved in this research, spoke to Medical News Today about its findings. He noted that “understanding this topic is crucial for enhancing patient care, as symptoms due to discontinuation of antidepressants are not a rare occurrence in practice, usually triggered by patients discontinuing their medications by themselves without making their providers aware.” “The incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms is approximately 15%, affecting one in six to seven patients who discontinue their medication. Knowledge of potential withdrawal symptoms can guide physicians and patients in determining the optimal times to start, adjust, and discontinue medications.” – Joao L. de Quevedo, MD, PhD De Quevedo also pointed out that “antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS) can last not only 1-2 weeks as thought before, but also months.” It is also “clinically helpful to understand which antidepressants are more likely to cause severe withdrawal symptoms, allowing for more informed and careful management of medication discontinuation,” de Quevedo explained. David Merrill, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist and director of the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Pacific Brain Health Center at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, also not involved in the study, similarly noted that this is an important topic to cover. “It’s helpful to be able to tell patients that discontinuation symptoms are possible but not inevitable, and even less likely to be severe. So if stopping a drug becomes an issue, they should let their doctor know so they can help figure out what to do,” Merrill said. “It’s often possible to lessen discontinuation symptoms by temporarily resuming the discontinued drug and the re-attempting the process of stopping the medication. Ideally, the second time stopping can be done more gradually over a longer period of time to lessen or prevent side effects from re-emerging.” – David Merrill, MD, PhD De Quevedo added that “awareness of withdrawal symptoms is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of antidepressants, as well as recognizing that these symptoms, if they occur, are a normal part of the process.” “This understanding can help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health treatment and encourage more individuals to seek help when needed,” he said. “Although studies show no difference between tapering the drug and abruptly stopping it, tapering is likely safer,” de Quevedo explained. “Desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine, and escitalopram were associated with higher frequencies of discontinuation symptoms, and imipramine, paroxetine, and either desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine were associated with a higher severity of symptoms. Understanding antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS) symptoms can also prevent the abrupt cessation of medications.” – Joao L. de Quevedo, MD, PhD Merrill agreed, noting that the study “calls out certain ‘usual suspects’ more known to cause side effects when stopping.” “It may be especially important to warn patients about the risks of stopping these drugs and to do so under the guidance of an experienced provider,” he added."
12,Tony Hicks,"Healthy aging: How moderate exercise, adequate sleep can help",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-sleep-moderate-exercise-can-encourage-healthy-aging,Researchers say people who exercise even moderately and get 7 hours of sleep per night have a significantly higher chance of aging in a healthy manner than people who are more sedentary,2024-06-11T07:39:00Z,"Getting enough sleep and doing moderate-to-vigorous exercise can help with healthy aging, according to a study published today in the journal JAMA Network Open. The study’s recommendations may sound like common sense, but the research adds more weight to the idea that a combination of movement and good sleep, even into later years, helps make for a longer, healthier life.  The study authors said more vigorous physical activity is associated with increased odds of healthy aging. They added that sleep duration has an inverted U-shaped association with healthy aging, with seven hours of daily sleep associated with the highest odds of healthy aging. However, they caution that in modern society, vigorous physical activity accounts for only about 4% of adults’ waking time whereas sedentary behavior occupies approximately 60% of adults’ waking time and has significantly increased over time. The cohort study looked at 45,176 females from the ongoing Nurses Health Study, which started in 1976 and is funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study examined nurses 50 years and older who didn’t have major chronic disease in 1992. Scientists followed up with them for 20 years. The data was analyzed from January to May 2022.  The scientists defined healthy aging as living to at least 70 while maintaining four health domains (mental health, physical function, no major chronic diseases, and no impairment in subjective memory).  The researchers used an isotemporal (in the same time frame) substitution model to evaluate the potential impact on healthy aging by replacing one hour of one behavior with the equivalent duration of another. The mean age of subjects was 59 years, with a range of 50 to 72 years. After 20 years of follow-up, 3,873 women (8%) achieved healthy aging. By age 50, that baseline number was 18%; At 55 it was 9%. At 60 it was 4%. And by 65 years old, it less than 1%.  Of those possessing the four domains of healthy aging, 18,696 women (41%) didn’t have any of the 11 chronic diseases; 7,250 women (16%) reported no impairment of physical function; 19,937 women (44%) reported no mental health limitations, and 23,465 women (52%) had no impairment of memory function. The study found sedentary behavior was associated with reduced odds of healthy aging, but light physical activity increased the odds of healthy aging. Researchers reported that the study subjects who replaced time spent watching television with light physical activity as well as those who did moderate to vigorous physical activity or got at least seven hours of sleep were all associated with better odds of healthy aging.  The researchers concluded that sedentary behaviors – especially prolonged television watching – were associated with decreased odds of healthy aging.  In comparison, light physical activity was associated with significantly increased odds of healthy aging and moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with even higher odds of achieving healthy aging.  “These findings complement previous evidence on the association between these behaviors and mortality and provide important evidence for promoting active lifestyles for achieving optimal health at older ages,” the study authors wrote. Researchers pointed out that aging is an important public health issue. In fact, about 10% of the world’s population is more than 65 years old. That number is expected to hit 16% by 2050. The study authors said aging is usually accompanied by adverse health conditions, including cognitive decline, chronic diseases, psychological disorders, and limitations in physical function.  They said the effects of aging causes “a huge burden on individuals, families, and society” and “approaches to achieve healthy aging, typically defined as being disease-free and physically, mentally, and cognitively healthy are urgently needed.” The authors noted only 10% to 35% of older adults achieve healthy aging and identifying modifiable behaviors can help increase that percentage. Ryan Glatt, CPT, a senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in California, told Medical News Today the study simply means promoting more movement and less sedentary time, especially for older adults, can improve certain aspects of health and quality of life. “To improve sleep and start exercising, maintain a regular sleep schedule and a relaxing bedtime routine,” said Glatt, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Ensure your sleep environment is cool, dark, and quiet, and limit screen time before bed.” “For exercise, try to incorporate aerobic exercise, resistance training, neuromotor exercises, mind-body exercises and/or more physical activity,” he added. “All of these modalities provide both shared and unique health benefits, which may also improve sleep. More relaxing modalities that incorporate breathing and stretching, such as yoga and tai chi, may be helpful prior to sleep.” Dr. Neil Paulvin is an anti-aging and longevity doctor in New York City. He told Medical News Today that combining enough sleep with the right amount of exercise has numerous benefits. “Sleep helps aging in many ways, including improved memory, improved heart health, better glucose control, less risk of Alzheimer’s and more,” Paulvin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said. “Exercise, due to the production of myokines, is so important for aging. It helps maintain cognitive health, decreases inflammation, builds muscle important for longevity, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers blood pressure, and much much more.”"
13,Eileen Bailey,Weight loss surgeries can help treat prediabetes and type 2 diabetes,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/type-2-diabetes-how-gastric-surgeries-can-help-people-with-prediabetes-and-obesity,Researchers say gastric surgeries can help people with prediabetes from developing type 2 diabetes. They add that these procedures can also help people with type 2 diabetes and obesity manage their weight over a long term.,2024-06-12T03:55:00Z,"Two studies on gastric surgeries and diabetes have been presented at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery’s 2024 Annual Scientific Meeting. In one study, researchers reported that people with prediabetes and severe obesity who had gastric surgery were much less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people with prediabetes who did not have bariatric surgery.  The other study concluded that type 2 diabetes could remain in remission after surgery for 15 years and most people who underwent the procedures sustained their weight loss for at least 20 years. The first study, which hasn’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, was a retrospective review of research. In it, researchers looked at 1,326 participants who had prediabetes and underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy between 2001 and 2022. More than 80% of the participants were female with an average age of 45 and a mean body mass index (BMI) of nearly 47. The mean follow-up period was about 7 years. The researchers reported that the participants who had obesity and prediabetes and who underwent bariatric surgery were 20 times less likely to develop type 2 diabetes over 15 years than those who did not undergo surgery. During follow-up, the scientists also found that: In comparison, 31% of those with prediabetes who did not have metabolic surgery developed type 2 diabetes within 5 years. In addition, 51% of participants with prediabetes who didn’t have the surgery developed type 2 diabetes within 10 years with 68% developing diabetes within 15 years. The researchers also noted weight loss, indicating that those who had bariatric surgery lost an average of 29% of their body weight at 12 months and 27% at 36 months. “Prediabetes is diabetes,” said Dr. Christine Ren-Fielding, the chief of bariatric surgery at NYU Langone Health and surgical director of NYU Langone’s Weight Management Program in New York. “Some people think in terms of ‘it’s only prediabetes.’ But you shouldn’t wait until you have diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you should take it seriously.” “If you are working to manage your weight or blood sugar, having prediabetes means your treatment strategies aren’t working, and you should talk to your doctor about adjusting treatments,” Ren-Fielding, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. In the second study, which also hasn’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers reported that type 2 diabetes remained in remission for up to 15 years in participants who had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, which reduces the size of the stomach and reroutes the small intestine as well as limits food intake and calorie absorption. The participants also kept most of the weight off for up to 20 years. “Weight loss surgery is very effective, but it is underutilized,” said Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. “It has long-term benefits as soon as the 15-year remission. However, only 1 to 2 percent of people who would benefit from surgery get it. For health insurance coverage, people need a [body mass index] BMI of 40, which could be 35 to 40 if there are other medical conditions,” Ali, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. Researchers reviewed the remission rates and weight loss outcomes of 2,045 people who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery between 2001 and 2008 during a follow-up of up to 20 years. Participants were, on average, 46 years old with a BMI of nearly 48 before surgery. A total of 677 participants had pre-operative diabetes. The findings included: “People on insulin at the time of surgery probably won’t experience complete remission,” Ren-Fielding said. “You are better off having surgery during the early stages of diabetes before needing insulin. If you need insulin, your pancreas is already overworked. Surgery will help, but not as much as if it was done before insulin was needed.” Obesity affects about 42% of people in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. the condition can weaken the immune system, cause chronic inflammation, and contribute to cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. “The best therapy for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes remains surgery,” said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, the chief of bariatric surgery at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “Too few people are educated about surgery. My comment would be that medical therapy keeps you from dying, but probably [completed] surgical procedures keep you from aging as fast,” Roslin, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “For many reasons, the best operation for diabetes is not bypass or sleeve, but SADI-S or SIPS,” Roslin added. “The difference is that bypass has high glucose fluctuations and these do not. Sleeves do not alter intestinal mechanisms, which are key for sensing what is eaten and providing satiety. SADI combines a sleeve with an intestinal bypass. As a result, get the mechanical fullness signals initiated in the stomach and the lasting fullness that comes from food hitting the bottom portion of the intestine.” “Sleeve patients get full fast, but a year or two after surgery, they get hungry quickly,” he added. “Bypass is similar, but Sadi is more lasting and has no glucose swings.” "
14,Eileen Bailey,Weight loss: Bariatric surgery more effective than obesity drugs,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bariatric-surgery-better-for-weight-loss-than-glp-1-drugs-such-as-ozempic,Researchers say bariatric surgery is more effective and has longer lasting impacts for weight loss than GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and lifestyle interventions,2024-06-11T09:18:00Z,"Compared to GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, bariatric surgery provides the most significant and most sustained weight loss, according to a study presented at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery’s 2024 Annual Scientific Meeting. For their findings, which haven’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers completed systematic reviews of studies published between 2020 and 2024. They reported that bariatric surgery, also called metabolic or weight-loss surgery, provided better results — both in terms of weight loss and sustained time — than GLP-1 agonists. The scientists reviewed studies that included thousands of people from clinical studies and several randomized clinical trials. They reported that lifestyle interventions, including diet and exercise, resulted in an average weight loss of 7% of body weight. However, they reported that people typically regained the weight within about 4 years. They said that GLP-1 medications and weight loss surgery were superior to lifestyle interventions. “Diet and exercise do not work for the vast majority of people,” said Dr. Christine Ren-Fielding, the chief of bariatric surgery at NYU Langone Health and surgical director of NYU Langone’s Weight Management Program in New York.  “Genetic makeup is often to blame,” Ren-Fielding, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “The perception of people who are obese is that they are lazy and don’t care. That usually isn’t true. They need options other than diet and exercise.” The researchers studied a number of treatments for obesity. They reported that 20 weeks of weekly injections of GLP-1 semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) resulted in a 10% body weight loss and 36 weeks of weekly injections of tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) resulted in a 21% body weight loss. They also reported that: When looking at the results of weight loss surgery, the researchers found a total weight loss of nearly 32% for gastric bypass and 29% for sleeve gastrectomy one year after surgery. Study participants maintained weight loss of about 25% up to 10 years after surgery. “Metabolic and bariatric surgery are the most effective and durable treatment for obesity, said Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California.  “Diet and exercise are only effective for 1 to 2 percent of people who are obese,” Ali, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “Not only is it the most effective for weight loss, but it is also the most effective for sustaining weight loss. Surgery is very underutilized, with only about 1 to 2 percent of people who could benefit from it getting the surgery. These surgeries have long-term benefits with remissions lasting 15 years or more.” Another expert agrees with Ali’s assessment. “The best therapy for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes remains surgery,” said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, the chief of bariatric surgery at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “The results are lasting as the control mechanism is part of you.” “In comparison, the GLP medicines have half as much weight loss in diabetics, as those without,” Roslin, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “Stated differently, these medications have been approved for diabetes for approximately 10 years. Numbers have only increased and few have had lasting weight loss similar to these studies.” “Too few people are educated about surgery,” Roslin added. “My comment would be that medical therapy keeps you from dying, but surgical procedures probably keep you from aging as fast.” However, experts note that lifestyle changes are important, even with surgery. “No matter how a person chooses to lose weight, diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes are still essential to maintain weight loss,” said Anne Danahy, a registered dietician and nutritionist who was not involved in the study. “Bariatric surgery has the potential for the most significant and longest-lasting weight loss, but because it alters your digestive tract and limits what and how much you can eat, it also requires a commitment to permanent diet and lifestyle changes,” she told Medical News Today. “Without those long-term changes, it’s very possible to regain much of the weight after the surgery.” GLP-1 agonists such as Ozempic and Wegovy are used to treat obesity and diabetes. They work by lowering glucose levels and managing hunger. The medications are typically injectables, with many taken once a week. Semaglutide is available as a daily tablet. “I think the GLP-1 medications are more in demand right now,” Ali said. “They offer a weight loss solution that is lower risk than surgery. For some people with underlying medical conditions, surgery is not an option, and the medications provide an alternative.” “Insurance coverage can be an issue. Most companies require a BMI [body mass index] of 30 without other medical conditions and a BMI of 27 if other medical conditions are present,” Ali added. “Some insurance companies do not cover the medications and if someone is paying out of pocket, they can cost $1,000 or more per month.” Another issue is that people can gain half their weight back when they stop taking the medications. “The medications control hunger and when they are stopped, the hunger returns,” Fielding said. “Think blood pressure medications. Your blood pressure is controlled while you are taking the medications and as soon as you stop, your blood pressure goes up.” “These medications are wonderful and very effective if you want to lose 30 pounds,” Ren-Fielding said. “But if you want to lose 100 pounds, they aren’t as effective. Surgery is the best option in those cases.” With so many choices, picking the best option can be difficult. “Determining the best weight loss strategy — bariatric surgery, diet and lifestyle changes, or a GLP-1 drug, like semaglutide or tirzepatide — depends on your health conditions, weight loss goals, and health history,” said Tatiana Ridley, a wellness expert, holistic nutritionist, and health coach who was not involved in the study. “Some clients in our Medical Weight Loss Program at ReBalance NYC require weight loss before undergoing bariatric surgery. To help them achieve their pre-surgery goals, we integrate diet and lifestyle plans, often with GLP-1 medications,” she told Medical News Today. Ridley lists several things to consider when selecting a weight loss plan: “Considering these factors and working with healthcare professionals, you can determine the most appropriate and effective weight loss strategy for your needs,” Ridley said. According to the World Health Organization, obesity is a chronic disease characterized by excessive fat deposits that can impair health. The condition can lead to type 2 diabetes and heart disease, increase the risk of some cancers, affect bone health and reproduction, and negatively influence the quality of life. It can also cause inflammation and weaken the immune system. Obesity is measured using BMI. For adults, a BMI equal to or greater than 25 is considered overweight. A measurement equal to or greater than 30 is considered obese. The researchers noted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that obesity affects 42% of people living in the United States."
15,"Paul Ian Cross, PhD","Weight loss: How intense exercise may backfire, leading to weight gain",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/intense-exercise-may-cause-weight-gain,New research shows intense exercise may unexpectedly contribute to weight gain by reducing subsequent physical activity and lowering body temperature. This effect may be linked to disruptions in the circadian rhythm of the stress hormone corticosterone.,2024-06-13T17:29:59Z,"Exercise involves taking part in physical activities that elevate heart rate above resting levels. Physical activity plays an essential role in maintaining physical and mental well-being and is frequently recommended as an effective strategy for weight loss. Whether individuals opt for light activities like walking or more intense exercises such as uphill cycling or weight lifting, regular physical activity offers a wide array of benefits for the body and mind. Engaging in daily exercise of any intensity is vital for preventing various diseases and health problems. However, a recent mouse study, published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suggests that intense exercise sessions may lead to reduced subsequent physical activity and lower body temperature, which may contribute to weight gain. The researchers also evaluated how circadian rhythm, the body’s natural sleep and wake cycle, played a role in activity by examining the stress hormone corticosterone, which regulates the circadian rhythm.  While exercise has numerous health benefits, its impact on weight loss can sometimes be less than anticipated. This could be due to a decrease in physical activity following exercise, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Corticosterone, which follows a circadian rhythm — is lowest at bedtime and peaks around the time we wake up —regulates both physical and mental activity levels. In this study, researchers hypothesized that even a single session of high-intensity exercise could disrupt this rhythm, leading to decreased physical activity, lower heat production and diminished weight loss effects. To test this hypothesis, mice were divided into three groups: high-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise and rest. Their physical activity and core body temperature, indicators of heat production, were monitored before and after exercise. The researchers also noted a disruption in the synchrony between physical activity and body temperature. They confirmed a positive correlation where relatively low blood corticosterone levels during wake times were associated with reduced physical activity. These findings indicate that a single session of high-intensity exercise can disrupt corticosterone’s circadian rhythm, leading to decreased physical activity, lower body temperature and weight gain. This study underscores the importance of considering not just the calories burned during exercise but also the subsequent activity levels and circadian rhythm when designing exercise regimens for effective weight loss. Lead researcher Takashi Matsui, PhD, from the Institute of Health and Sport Sciences at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, explained the key findings to Medical News Today: “Our study found that while exercise is a powerful strategy for weight loss, a single session of high-intensity exercise that induces heavy sweating can significantly reduce subsequent physical activity and core body temperature, leading to weight gain. Interestingly, this weight gain occurs despite no changes in food intake.” Matsui added that “these phenomena are likely due to disruptions in the circadian rhythm of the stress hormone corticosterone and disturbances in the synchronization between physical activity and body temperature.” “Therefore, it is important to consider not only the energy expenditure during exercise but also the subsequent activity levels and circadian rhythm when setting appropriate exercise intensity for effective weight loss,” Matsui said. Ryan Glatt, CP, senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, pointed out that “this animal study questions the benefits of vigorous exercise for weight loss, suggesting it might actually cause weight gain by reducing activity levels afterward and disrupting body temperature.” “The research, conducted on mice, shows that high-intensity workouts may have complex effects on metabolism that aren’t fully understood,” Glatt said. Mark A. Anton, MD, medical director at Slimz Weightloss, also not involved in this research, described the study as fascinating. “It’s important to recognize that while vigorous exercise has its benefits, it can also lead to reduced activity levels outside of exercise sessions and potentially impact body temperature regulation. This can sometimes counteract weight loss efforts if not managed properly,” Anton explained. Matsui highlighted that the research “adds new evidence to the emerging theory that animals, including humans, tend to compensate for the energy expenditure of exercise (especially a single bout of high-intensity exercise) by reducing energy use in other activities.” “Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the beneficial effects of maintaining an active lifestyle beyond just exercise,” Matsui noted. Glatt agreed, saying that, “overall, this study suggests rethinking the focus on intense exercise, considering the potential benefits of more moderate and consistent activity for weight loss.” However, “It’s important to note that these results are from animal studies and may not directly apply to humans,” Glatt highlighted. “For weight loss and weight management, I recommend a balanced approach that includes a mix of moderate-intensity aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking or cycling, combined with resistance training. This combination helps to burn calories, build muscle, and maintain a higher metabolic rate. It’s also crucial to incorporate rest and recovery to prevent burnout and ensure sustainable progress.” — Mark A. Anton, MD “To fully benefit from exercise, it is important to engage in moderate exercise that does not hinder overall daily activity and to perform this exercise regularly rather than sporadically,” Matsui said.  “This approach would ensure that the benefits of exercise are sustained and do not inadvertently lead to weight gain,” he concluded."
16,Jeanna D. Smiley,Multiple sclerosis: Can dietary choices influence risk?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/healthy-diet-once-weekly-fatty-fish-intake-may-help-keep-ms-at-bay,"A recent study has found a link between following a healthy, Mediterranean-type diet, and a lower risk of multiple sclerosis. But how generalizable are its findings?",2024-06-13T16:53:16Z,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory illness of the central nervous system (CNS) with rising prevalence. It is a progressive condition, which means that it will likely worsen over time. MS is the most common debilitating neurodegenerative disease among young adults. Symptoms often appear between the ages of 20 and 40, but they can present at any age. Some experts believe that genetic and environmental factors, such as smoking, obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light may increase the likelihood of MS onset. Scientists at the Università del Piemonte Orientale in Novaro, Italy scoured the vast UK Biobank for clues linking diet and lifestyle factors with the condition. Their findings appear in the journal Nutrients. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease which causes the immune system to attack myelin, a substance that coats nerve fibers. The illness is marked by lesions in the central nervous system, or CNS, which can cause physical or cognitive impairment. Such issues can lead to sensory disturbances, visual impairments, lack of coordination, and paralysis. Disease subtypes include clinically isolated syndrome, primary progressive MS, relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Female MS patients outnumber male counterparts two to one. Researchers have been studying this condition for a long time, continuously looking for interventions that could help people lower their odds of developing MS. One lifestyle factors that researchers have been looking at in relation to MS risk has been diet. Prior research conducted by some of the present study’s authors had suggested that gut health may influence the CNS. In their current paper, they state that “the existence of a gut–brain axis supports the importance of considering diet as an important modulator of gut homeostasis and, consequently, of CNS health.” The scientists further note that a pro-inflammatory gut environment may elevate neuroinflammation and MS risk. The study’s authors used data from the UK Biobank, one of the largest biomedical databases currently available. They did so to address “a paucity of large-scale prospective studies regarding […] dietary exposures that are focused on the general population,” as they explain in the paper. At its start, this study cohort included 502,507 residents of the United Kingdom aged 40–69 years. The presence of MS was determined by hospital admissions with MS diagnoses or self-reported diagnoses of MS. At the study’s baseline, in 2006, all participants answered a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), through which they reported their usual consumption of 29 different food groups and alcohol over the previous year. Participants answered questions about their daily intake of cooked vegetables, raw vegetables, fresh and dried fruits. They also reported their weekly intake of fatty fish, processed meats, beef, lamb, poultry, cheese, salt added to food, and other foods. A subsample of participants also completed online interviews that recalled the previous 24 hours of dietary choices. The results were based on investigating 200 different foods and beverages. “Since it [the online interview tool] automatically calculated the energy and nutritional contents of the reported food items, we were able to evaluate the impact of single micro- or macronutrient intake on the disease risk,” the study authors write. They also used the dietary data to calculate the participants’ Mediterranean Diet scores. After exclusions due to participant retractions or missing information, the final cohort included 499,563 people. The present study also considered the role that additional lifestyle factors may play in MS onset. The authors combed through data on body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity. An average of 12 years of follow-up data identified 478 MS cases developing among the study cohort. This indicates a prevalence rate of 7.78 MS cases for every 100,000 person-years. People who face an increased MS risk included those who smoked, had a vitamin D deficiency, or who had a history of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Genetic determinants for obesity and for obesity during childhood were also linked to an elevated MS risk. The study’s authors observed an inverse correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean diet type and MS onset, suggesting that a healthy, plant- and whole-food-rich diet that included moderate fatty fish consumption may help protect against this chronic condition. To the study authors’ knowledge, their work is the first to observe a “slightly protective” effect of moderate fish intake. Eating fatty fish once weekly appeared to be more protective than more frequent consumption. Medical News Today discussed the study findings with Kelsey Costa, MS, RDN, and Sarah Hormachea, MS, RD, BC-ADM, CDCES, both of them registered dietitians not involved in this research. Costa commented that “[a] key strength of this study is its use of the UK Biobank database, a comprehensive resource that offers a vast amount of data from a large cohort.” However, both dietitians expressed concerns about the study’s limitations. Hormachea noted that “[t]he UK Biobank cohort consists of volunteers [including mostly white and high-income individuals], which may not be representative of the general population.“ She cautioned that: “Participants who choose to join such studies often have different health behaviors and socio-economic statuses compared to those who do not participate.” Costa also said that ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in the Biobank database, which may limit the generalizability of the study’s findings to those populations. The potential for recall bias also stood out to Hormachea, as study participants might not have accurately remembered or reported their food intake. In turn, Costa felt that the small number of MS cases “may reduce the statistical power of the analysis.“ “In other words,“ she said “it can be hard to accurately observe small effects unless you have very large sample sizes.” Potential confounding factors, such as the nutrient density of the participants’ diets, might have influenced the findings, Costa remarked. She pointed out that “the study did not assess cooking methods, food processing, and the nutrient composition of specific food items or types of alcoholic beverages.” Lastly, she cautioned that due to the study’s observational nature, causality cannot be established. Hormachea furthermore suggested that reverse causality could be an issue, as people diagnosed with MS might have changed their eating habits subsequently. MNT asked Costa if she has seen positive results from dietary adjustments among people with MS. She noted that different types of diets are likely to have different effects ion people living with this condition: “Broadly speaking, hypercaloric diets can be problematic for multiple sclerosis, and conversely, low-calorie diets and diets high in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods may improve signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis.” Nevertheless, she hypothesized that a Mediterranean diet may be able to help lower the risk of MS, especially compared to a typical Western diet. The study’s authors believe that their “validated approach” of using 24-hour recall data has provided novel insights “insights into the role of complex dietary patterns, instead of single foods, in disease onset.” Their data forms a basis for more specific studies which may help formulate evidence-based protocol for MS prevention and management. Considering the various disease subtypes and phenotypes, they say, “may lead to new insights useful for personalizing dietary approaches in the context of precision nutrition.”"

Research indicates that Mediterranean and MIND diets may protect against Alzheimer’s, potentially due to lower intake of inflammatory saturated fats and sugars and higher consumption of vitamins, minerals, omega-3s, and antioxidants. Since Alzheimer’s is associated with elevated oxidative stress, increased antioxidant intake might be especially beneficial. Antioxidants counteract free radical damage, possibly mitigating disease effects. A recent study published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia explored urolithin A, a natural compound produced by gut bacteria when they process certain polyphenolic compounds found in pomegranates. Urolithin A has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, along with other potential benefits for brain health. Researchers treated various Alzheimer’s mouse models with urolithin A for 5 months to assess long-term effects on brain health. The results showed that urolithin A could enhance learning and memory, reduce neuroinflammation, and improve cellular cleanup processes in Alzheimer’s disease mice. Although animal studies do not directly translate to humans, experts believe urolithin A may have potential as a future preventive or therapeutic agent for Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark conducted a study to understand the benefits of long-term urolithin A treatment in Alzheimer’s disease.  Using three mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they combined urolithin A treatment with behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and bioinformatic experiments. After five months of urolithin A treatment, they observed improvements in memory, protein build-up, cell waste processing, and DNA damage in the brains of Alzheimer’s mice.  Additionally, important markers of brain inflammation were reduced, making the treated mice more similar to healthy ones. The study revealed that urolithin A treatment lowered the excessive activity of microglia, a type of immune cell in the brain.  The researchers also suggest that urolithin A: The mitophagy effects from urolithin A may be similar to those seen with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) supplements in Alzheimer’s disease. Some of the researchers in this study have connections to several companies, including ChromaDex, which is known for its NAD supplement. It’s unclear how these ties might influence the present study’s results. Medical News Today spoke with Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.  He noted that, in the present mouse model study, urolithin A “treatment positively impacted several aspects of brain health, such as improving memory function, reducing harmful protein build-up, decreasing brain inflammation, enhancing cellular waste removal, and preventing DNA damage in key brain regions.”  “Collectively [the results] mean that [urolithin A] can act as a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent to help clear [amyloid beta, which] prevents the onset of cognitive deficits associated with the pathological [amyloid beta] deposition [and can] regulate cellular energy homeostasis and cell death.” — Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS In other words, urolithin A may have multiple mechanisms of action contributing to its positive effects on the brain.  Specifically, Urolithin A may help protect against cognitive decline by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress and promoting the clearance of harmful proteins and damaged mitochondria from the brain. MNT also spoke with Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT, a registered dietitian, certified gastrointestinal nutritionist, and owner of Nutrition Resolution in Phoenix, Arizona, who was not involved in the study. She noted the study’s strengths and weaknesses: “While the study provides important insights into urolithin A’s potential benefits for Alzheimer’s, it is limited by its reliance on animal models and its narrow focus on specific pathways, possibly overlooking broader systemic interactions. However, its strengths lie in the thorough assessment of multiple pathological mechanisms and investigation of long-term treatment effects, which significantly advances our understanding of urolithin A’s therapeutic role in Alzheimer’s.” “The research indicates that urolithin A treatment shows potential as a new intervention for Alzheimer’s disease by addressing various pathological mechanisms like neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal dysfunction, and DNA damage, potentially slowing down the progression of the disease,” Simpson added. However, “[w]hile research on urolithin A offers promise for Alzheimer’s intervention, additional studies, particularly clinical trials, are required to validate its efficacy and safety in humans,” she cautioned. Holland agreed but highlighted challenges in determining urolithin A’s outcomes and optimal dosage through randomized controlled trials.  He explained that controlling for diet, gut microbiota, and individual health conditions is difficult, and these factors can influence urolithin A absorption and utilization in the body.  Additionally, Holland said that if subjects consume other polyphenol-rich foods, it complicates isolating the effects of the administered urolithin A from that produced naturally through diet.  More research is needed to determine the best urolithin A doses, and the potential risks of long-term supplement use since both of these are unknown.  “There could be risks associated with trying urolithin A pills for Alzheimer’s intervention since there is limited research on their safety and effectiveness,” cautioned Simpson. Promoting the body’s urolithin A production through diet may be a more natural and safe approach. Holland explained that urolithin A is a natural compound produced by gut bacteria when exposed to certain polyphenols, like ellagitannins and ellagic acid, which are present in many fruits and nuts.  Holland and Simpson highlighted some of the best food sources of these polyphenols, including: Both experts stated that pomegranate seeds (arils) and peels are especially abundant in polyphenolic compounds that can be converted to urolithin A. However, Simpson noted that the bioavailability and effectiveness of urolithin A from pomegranate and other foods might vary due to individual differences in gut microbiota, “influencing the extent of potential benefits.” Holland supported this, remarking that this study’s “findings reiterate the importance of having a diverse and robust gut microbiota to ensure optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients and polyphenols.”  “Although the work was done in mice and cannot be directly generalized to humans, it builds upon previous research and emphasizes that the foods we consume are crucial for brain health,” he concluded."
18,Finn Cohen,IBD: Scientists find major cause that drives excessive inflammation,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/scientists-find-new-major-cause-inflammatory-bowel-disease,Scientists have identified a new genetic mechanism that drives the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions.,2024-06-14T06:38:00Z,"Scientists at the Francis Crick Institute in London have identified a genetic mechanism underpinning the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions and identified existing drugs that could target this pathway. Previous genome-wide association studies into IBD, and some other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, had identified variants on a region of the genome as being linked to these conditions. The role they played in these diseases was unclear as this part of the genome was a “gene desert” which contained non-coding regions of DNA. There, they found a section of DNA that enhances the number of proteins that nearby genes make; this enhancer was translated only in macrophages, an immune cell with significant function in IBD. It essentially raised the volume on a gene called ETS2, a gene quite a long way away from this section of DNA, which scientists found was essential for almost all inflammatory functions in macrophages, including several that directly contribute to tissue damage in IBD. An increased amount of ETS2 activity in macrophages made them resemble inflammatory cells in patients with IBD. The findings were published in the journal Nature. There are no drugs that directly block ETS2, but the researchers found that MEK inhibitors — drugs that can be used to treat cancer — targetted other parts of this pathway and reduced inflammation in macrophages and gut samples from patients with IBD.  This development could help to identify drugs and drug targets to treat IBD, which has historically proved challenging. Irritable bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to a range of symptoms including pain, diarrhea, and less commonly constipation, weight loss, and problems absorbing nutrients. An estimated 6 million people worldwide have IBD, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that there are about 3 million people in the U.S. who have it. The root cause has not been identified, but a recent study suggests a connection between genetics, diet, and gut microbiota that could lead to developing IBD. Only about 10% of the drugs to treat such inflammatory or autoimmune diseases that enter the clinical development stage become fully approved for treatment, which the researchers for this paper say reflects a poor understanding of how these diseases work. This prompted their research, which was intended to explore how genetic pathways could contribute to these diseases.  Ruslan Medzhitov, PhD, sterling professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, told Medical News Today that the researchers’ findings represent very important advances in the identification and targeting of genetic variants that can cause IBD and other medical issues. “Studies that look for genetic associations with a particular disease often find signals (genomic variants) that do not match any specific genes. This makes it very hard to figure out how these variants impact on the disease development. In this case, such a genetic variant was mapped to a region of a part of the human genome where a long stretch of DNA is devoid of genes (so-called ‘Gene Desert’),” Medzhitov said.  “In this study, researchers were able to discover that this genetic variant, known to be associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affected a piece of DNA that controlled the expression of a gene (called ETS2) located far away from the variant. This is the first major finding — connecting an ‘anonymous’ mutation to a specific gene. Secondly, they demonstrated that elevated expression of ETS2 in macrophages promotes their inflammatory functions, which would explain how it contributes to IBD development.”— Ruslan Medzhitov, PhD Şebnem Ünlüişler, genetic engineer at the London Regenerative Institute, told Medical News Today that while the research is a step forward to understanding how inflammatory or autoimmune diseases operate, a broader test of the findings needs to be performed. “The study highlights the significant role of the ETS2 gene in mediating inflammation in macrophages, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). By identifying a specific enhancer within a gene desert that regulates ETS2, the research provides a deeper understanding of how genetic variations can contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions,” Ünlüişler said.  “One potential flaw is that the study’s experiments were mostly done in controlled lab settings, which might not fully replicate the complex environment in a living organism. More diverse and larger sample sizes could help confirm the findings,” she added. “IBD is a complex disease, with many genes making contributions to different degrees. This particular pathway may be relevant for a subset of IBD patients,” Medzhitov said. “But a broader implication is that the approaches used here can be applied to other cases where genetic variants have unknown mechanistic connection to a disease (and not just IBD).” Ünlüişler said that with more expansive application of the researchers’ findings, the ability to attack autoimmune diseases could be greatly increased. But she cautioned that the delicate nature of such diseases — and their pathways in the body — can complicate treatments. “If these results apply broadly, they could lead to new treatments targeting ETS2, potentially reducing inflammation more effectively and with fewer side effects than current treatments. However, targeting ETS2 precisely might be challenging and needs careful development to avoid unintended effects on other bodily functions,” she said."
19,Hannah Flynn,Anxiety: Mice study finds link to synthetic estrogens in birth control,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/synthetic-estrogens-birth-control-pills-linked-anxiety-rats,"Researchers found that rats given synthetic estrogen exhibited more behaviors associated with anxiety, compared to a more natural estrogen used in a more modern form of the contraceptive pill.",2024-06-07T15:02:42Z,"Rats given synthetic estrogens used in birth control pills exhibited greater signs of anxiety than those given natural estrogens, researchers have found. The study showed synthetic estrogens were associated with lower steroid hormone levels when compared to natural ones. The findings, which are not yet published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, were recently presented at ENDO 2024, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in Boston, MA.  The natural estrogen used in this study was similar to the one used in NOMAC-E2, a combined oral contraceptive formulation known as Zoely, which is produced by the pharmaceutical company Merck. The synthetic estrogen used in most combined hormonal contraceptive pills on the market is a highly potent synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol.  Researchers had been looking for natural estrogen to use in combined hormonal contraceptive pills since its inception 60 years ago, but these had not been potent enough for those pills to be an effective form of hormonal contraceptive. This changed in 2011 when Zoely was introduced to the market.  Abigail Hegwood, MS, who carried out the study, told Medical News Today she wanted to investigate the new, natural estrogen on the market as she had become aware there was little epidemiological data on the side effects of specific progestins and estrogens.  “I wanted to know [whether there is] a difference between these two estrogens. They just released this natural estrogen on the market. Does this possibly give us an opportunity to find a difference between formulations in terms of behavioral side effects?” — Abigail Hegwood, MS, study author Three groups of 12 female rats were given either ethinyl estradiol a synthetic estrogen with dienogest, a progestin often combined with it in oral combined hormonal contraception, or estradiol valerate a natural estrogen with dienogest, or a control, delivered via a subcutaneous pump for 28 days.  The researchers tested the rats’ spatial awareness and anxiety in a maze test between days 20–28 and collected serum samples on day 28.  The researchers discovered that the rats had similar spatial memory across all three groups.  However, rats that were given the synthetic estrogen had a different response to the spatial memory task in the maze test, which is believed to be associated with anxiety-like behaviors in these animals. Serum samples also showed that both types of estrogen reduced circulating testosterone. The authors note levels of estradiol in blood serum were below the detection limit in over half of rats given ethinyl estradiol. Previous research has shown that higher levels of testosterone and E2 reduce anxiety-related behaviors and improve spatial memory, the authors noted.  They propose that the results they have seen are due to the effect of synthetic estrogens on the brain.  “Ethinyl estradiol and estradiol valerate have different effects on hormone-binding globulin. And hormone-binding globulin can bind and render steroid hormones in the blood unavailable for use by the body. And so we know that ethinyl estradiol increases hormone-binding globulin, which increases the amount of bound steroid hormone in the blood,” Hegwood said. “So my hypothesis would be that because ethinyl estradiol is having this greater effect on the availability of steroid hormones, it would have a greater effect on the actions that these steroid hormones have on the body, including the brain,” she added. Hegwood’s supervisor Alesia Prakapenka, PhD, an assistant professor in the Biomedical Sciences program at Midwestern University in Downers Grove, Ill, told MNT: “Another potential outcome is there’s the feedback loop that’s being halted by the contraceptive treatments between the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the gonads.” Naturally-produced circulating estrogen was below the level of detection in many of the rats given ethinyl estradiol. “What we actually saw is that with the synthetic ethinyl estradiol group, more than half of the samples in that group had 17-beta estradiol levels that were actually below the limit of detection. And so it could be that even if it’s not the hormone itself from the contraceptive, it may be changing something within the feedback loop that then could be having that effect,” Prakapenka explained. Prakapenka said there hasn’t been much focus on the behavioral effects of hormonal contraception. “I think bringing this to attention is exciting because now we can start to look at it more and then combine it with additional factors that are across the lifespan could be impacting females, including pregnancy, including menopause,” she said. “There’s a lot of development that’s happening with different options for menopausal hormone therapy. So maybe taking those strategies, applying them to contraceptive use as well, kind of across the board, what a female can go through and how we can inform them of this. These are your options. These are kind of the individual changes that you may experience and how to adjust based on that individual woman, as opposed to women as a whole or females as a whole.”— Alesia Prakapenka, PhD While it was possible that combined hormonal contraception could affect the brain and, therefore, behavior, Jonathan Schaffir, MD, vice chair of Education in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, who was not involved in the research, said this effect would likely be small. “There are receptors for estrogens as well as other steroids in the human brain, and we know that providing exogenous hormones can influence mood and behavior to some degree. That said, I think that the influence of oral contraceptives is usually small, and it’s a small percentage of women who have any significant side effects that affect mood,” he told MNT.  “I think that you know, rat behavior is a far cry from human behavior, so looking at more appropriate measures of mood and behavior in humans would be appropriate. But I guess my other takeaway from this study is that it’s always important to examine the components of medications that we use, and to try to include, particularly in the setting of hormonal treatment, the versions of hormones that have the fewest side effects and the best physiologic response.”  — Jonathan Schaffir, MD “We should also strive to create new medications with better response and fewer side effects,” Schaffir concluded.

20,Elizabeth Pratt,Planetary Health Diet linked to 30% lower risk of premature death,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/planetary-health-diet-linked-to-lower-risk-of-death-from-cancer-heart-disease,"Researchers say the Planetary Health Diet, which emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and plant-based sources of protein, reduces the risk of premature death from cancer, heart disease, and lung disease",2024-06-10T04:47:00Z,"Closely following the Planetary Health Diet may reduce the risk of premature death by 30%. That’s according to research published today in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In their study, researchers say the Planetary Health Diet reduced the risk of every major cause of death, including heart disease, cancer, and lung disease for research participants. They add the plant-based diet can also help the environment. “Shifting how we eat can help slow the process of climate change. And what’s healthiest for the planet is also healthiest for humans,” Dr. Walter Willett, a co-author of the research and the chairman of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts, said in a press statement. “The findings show just how linked human and planetary health are. Eating healthfully boosts environmental sustainability — which in turn is essential for the health and wellbeing of every person on Earth,” he added. The Planetary Health Diet emphasizes plant-based foods as well as foods that are sustainable for the environment. A plate of food that follows the diet is made up of about half a plate of fruits and vegetables. The other half of the plate includes whole grains, unsaturated plant oils, plant protein sources, and optional modest amounts of protein from animal sources. “These foods provide abundant essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids that our body needs to stay healthy and prevent chronic disease. The diet also limits consumption of red and processed meat due to the higher environmental impact of these foods and their association with conditions like colorectal cancer and heart disease. By endorsing this diet, we can promote both human and planetary health,” Anna Arthur, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Dietetics and Nutrition at the University of Kansas Medical Center, told Medical News Today. “I do believe the Planetary Health Diet is a promising path forward to reduce the burden of chronic disease,” added Arthur, who was not involved in the study. “However, it is still important to consider individual preferences, cultural values, and nutritional needs when it comes to making dietary recommendations and adjusting the pattern accordingly. People interested in following this diet may benefit from working with a registered dietitian nutritionist who can guide them in adopting the diet while ensuring individual dietary needs and preferences are met.” In undertaking their study, the researchers examined data from more than 200,000 people involved in the Nurses’ Health Study I and II as well as the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. The participants in the studies had no major chronic diseases at the beginning of the study period. They completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for up to 34 years. The diets were then given a score based on their intake of food groups such as vegetables, whole grains, poultry, and nuts. Those in the top 10% who most closely adhered to the Planetary Health Diet had a 30% lower risk of premature death compared with those in the lowest 10% with the least adherence to the diet. Along with the health benefits, high adherence to the Planetary Health Diet was also found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29% as well as lowering cropland use by 51% and reducing fertilizer needs by 21%. Dana Hunnes, PhD, an assistant professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and author of “Recipe for Survival” says she believes planet-based diets are the wave of the future. “I endorse this diet whole heartedly because of its health properties and environmental benefits and wish the Dietary Guidelines for Americans by the USDA and those of other countries would follow suit,” Hunnes, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “I believe the planetary health diet is the way forward,” she added. “The faster we can get there as a society, the better off we are health-wise, longevity-wise, cost-wise, and environmentally. This type of diet costs less than medication, is good for us, and it’s good for the planet. I call this a win, win, win. Does it take more time to do than opening a package? Yes, it does. But, the cost-savings on your life and your cost of medication and health care over your life will be huge.” The American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and the American Diabetes Association all endorse a diet that emphasizes fruits and vegetables as well as limits intake of processed foods. The Planetary Health Diet shares similarities with diets such as the Mediterranean diet, pescatarian, vegetarian and DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diets. Christopher Gardner, PhD, is the chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee as well as a professor of medicine at Stanford University in California. He argues one of the benefits of the Planetary Health Diet is that it may provide an additional motivating factor for some people. “What I find challenging is motivating people to make substantive changes in their diet for the sake of their own health – many people are willing to postpone or delay making healthy diet improvements when they think that the only one they are impacting is themselves with these choices,” Gardner, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “The Planetary Health Diet actually provides a different kind of motivation,” he added. “It helps to make it clear that our personal dietary choices have an impact on our neighbors, community, state, nation, and world when all of those food choice decisions are considered collectively. The opportunity is here to make use of this Planetary Health Diet information to align personal health with planetary health, and perhaps to help motivate someone to make a change and sustain that change for the sake of not only themselves, but for society as well. In our research we have found this is an important potential motivator for meaningful dietary change.”"
21,Jessica Freeborn,Can vigorous exercise help lower cognitive impairment risk?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vigorous-exercise-may-protect-cognitive-health-in-people-with-hypertension,New research has found a link between regular vigorous exercise and more stable cognitive functioning in people with high blood pressure who are at risk of cognitive impairment.,2024-06-11T15:30:00Z,"Impairment of cognitive function can affect all aspects of a person’s life, including quality of life and day-to-day activities. Multiple factors can contribute to someone’s risk of developing problems in cognitive function, including high blood pressure, or hypertension. Researchers are interested in finding potential protective actions that people with high blood pressure can take. A new study published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association examined the relationship between vigorous physical activity and risk for mild cognitive impairment among people with high blood pressure. Researchers found that participants who engaged in one or more sessions of vigorous physical activity each week were at a lower risk for mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia. The results suggest that vigorous exercise may help preserve cognitive function among certain individuals. High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood pressing against blood vessel walls gets outside of a certain range. It can lead to damaged blood vessels and increase people’s risk for heart problems and stroke. A normal blood pressure reading is less than 120/80 millimeter of mercury (mmHg), and doctors may diagnose someone with high blood pressure when a systolic reading 130 mmHg or more or when a diastolic reading is 80 mmHg or more. Previous research has also linked high blood pressure in midlife with a higher risk for cognitive disorders. The authors of the current study note that people with high blood pressure are at a higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. José Morales, MD, a vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the current research, explained to Medical News Today that: “Hypertension damages the small blood vessels in our brain and also causes them to malfunction. This results in progressive damage to the brain, which in turn leads to cognitive impairment.” The researchers who conducted the current study wanted to evaluate if vigorous exercise helped with the risk for mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia. This study was a post hoc analysis using data from the SPRINT MIND STUDY, which formed part of the SPRINT trial. This trial involved over 9,000 adults in the United States who had high blood pressure. At enrolment, participants were asked about the frequency of participating in vigorous physical activity. Vigorous physical activity was defined as activities that induced sweat, increased heart rate, or increased breathing. Participants could pick their level of vigorous physical activity from the following categories: In the analysis, researchers divided participants into a low-vigorous physical activity group and a high-vigorous physical activity group. The low-vigorous physical activity group had less than one vigorous activity session a week, and the high-vigorous physical activity group had one or more vigorous activity sessions a week. All participants also underwent cognitive assessment tests, and covariates included components like age, education, smoking, use of antihypertensive medication, body mass index (BMI), and alcohol use. The researchers excluded participants who had limited physical function or missing cognitive assessments, allowing them to include 7,670 participants in their final analysis. The average follow-up time with participants was 4.5 years, and over this time, there were identified cases of mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia. Overall, participants in the high vigorous physical activity group were at a lower risk for mild cognitive impairment and probable dementia. The association was stronger among participants less than 75 years old at baseline, and Black participants. The association also appeared stronger in participants with prior cardiovascular disease. Study author Richard Kazibwe, MD, from Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, NC, noted to MNT that: “Engaging in vigorous physical activity at least once a week may help slow cognitive decline in individuals with hypertension. This level of physical activity may offer protection against both dementia and mild cognitive impairment. The study is unique because it focuses on individuals with high-risk hypertension, a population more likely to develop cognitive impairment. Previous studies have not specifically addressed this group.” According to Morales, “[t]his is an interesting study that demonstrates what many people with uncontrolled hypertension find counterintuitive.” “Exercise helps to regulate our autonomic nervous system and reduces the impact of these vascular risk factors on our health,” he explained. “People should be encouraged to see the impact lifestyle changes can have on modifying the consequences of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, as well as preserve brain health and functioning,” added Morales. Despite the intriguing findings, this study does face some specific limitations. First, some of the data came from participants’ self-reports, which means it can be inaccurate. Then, almost 65% of participants were white, and about 35% were women, indicating the need for greater diversity in future research and a limited ability to generalize the results. The findings also cannot be generalized to groups with certain conditions not represented in the SPRINT study, such as those with diabetes. The exclusion criteria of the current analysis could also have impacted the results.  The authors further acknowledge that their study “likely lacked the adequate statistical power to detect the benefit of [vigorous physical actvity] on the risk of probable dementia.” There is also a potential confounding risk, and researchers only looked at baseline data for vigorous physical activity. Changes in vigorous physical activity could have impacted cognitive outcomes.  Moreover, the researchers did not look at how moderate physical activity or the potential negatives of sedentary behavior could affect cognitive status. Finally, mild cognitive impairment “at the time of enrolment was not adjudicated,” which could have impacted the results. Future research can allow for longer follow-up times to confirm the findings of this research. Kazibwe noted that future research could include “[s]tudies using device-assessed physical activity in large and diverse populations are needed to investigate the benefits of vigorous physical activity for protecting against cognitive decline.”"
22,Tim Newman,"Dementia: Viagra may reduce risk, help prevention",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/viagra-shows-promise-in-boosting-brain-blood-flow-for-dementia-prevention,"Sildenafil (Viagra) may improve brain blood flow and blood vessel function, and help reduce the risk of vascular dementia, a new study suggests.",2024-06-13T14:59:14Z,"According to a recent study published in Circulation Research, sildenafil — more commonly known as Viagra — may reduce the risk of vascular dementia. After participants took the drug for three weeks, the scientists measured positive changes in the behavior of blood vessels in the brain. The study, called the OxHARP trial, lays the foundation for future clinical trials. Viagra, first designed to treat angina, rose to fame in the late 1990s as an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction. Because it is a relatively safe drug and affects a number of organs, such as the heart, liver, kidney, and brain, it is a good candidate for drug repurposing. For instance, scientists have already investigated whether sildenafil might help treat conditions including chronic pain, cancer, depression, kidney disease, and more. The latest study asks whether Viagra might help reduce the risk of developing vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a form of dementia caused by impaired blood flow or damaged blood vessels in the brain. It often occurs after a stroke. As the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia accounts for 15–20% of dementia cases in North America and Europe. Medical News Today spoke with José Morales, MD, a vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA.  Morales, who was not involved in the new study, told Medical News Today that “there are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.” However, “There is no cure,” so identifying risk factors and ways to reduce those risks is important.  Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is one such risk factor. CSVD is an umbrella term for a number of conditions that affect small blood vessels in the brain.  MNT reached out to one of the study’s authors, Alastair Webb, MSc, a consultant neurologist at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom. He provided an outline of CSVD: “Small vessel disease is chronic damage to the small blood vessels deep inside the brain, resulting in them becoming narrow, blocked, and leaky. This damage occurs to some extent in most people as they get older, but it is much more severe in some, often due to having high blood pressure for a long time.”  “The resulting damage may further reduce blood flow to the deep part of the brain resulting in strokes and dementia,” he explained.  In the recent study, the scientists recruited 75 people with neurological signs of CSVD. Every participant received 3-week regimens of sildenafil, placebo, and cilostazol — a treatment for vascular disease. Each course of drugs was separated by a “washout” period of at least 1 week. Testing all three drugs on all participants is called a crossover trial. These studies are powerful because each participant acts as their own control. They also require fewer participants to achieve statistically meaningful results. The researchers focused on the following measures. MNT asked Webb why they decided to investigate sildenafil: “It causes blood vessels to open up, to increase blood flow and the responsiveness of blood vessels,” he said. “As such, it had the right type of action to improve the blood flow problems seen in our patients, but it was unclear whether it worked in the brain in the same way.” The researchers found that sildenafil did not improve cerebral pulsatility compared with placebo. Although Webb “had reason to believe that it would reduce pulsations,” the team was not overly surprised that it did not work in this way. Importantly, though, sildenafil did improve cerebrovascular reactivity and resistance, and cerebral blood flow compared with placebo. Compared with cilostazol, Viagra performed similarly but produced fewer side effects, such as diarrhea. The authors conclude: “Overall, the improved cerebrovascular dynamics with sildenafil provide a new potential treatment to prevent progression of [cerebral small vessel disease] that needs testing in clinical trials.” Although it is still early days, this is a step toward understanding how to reduce the risk of vascular dementia.  MNT spoke with Rakesh C. Kukreja, PhD, professor of internal medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond, who was not involved in the study. On why Viagra might help reduce vascular dementia risk, Kukreja said: “Sildenafil is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which breaks down the powerful vasodilator molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).” “By preventing the breakdown of cGMP, sildenafil promotes the relaxation of blood vessels and improves blood flow. Therefore, the enhanced cerebral blood flow and reduced vascular resistance from sildenafil treatment might influence the risk of dementia,” he said. It is worth mentioning that this study’s results line up with earlier research. For instance, a study using a rodent model of vascular dementia found that Viagra improved cognitive ability and memory. Other rodent studies produced similar findings. Also, studies in a human population concluded that Viagra usage was linked with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Similarly, Kukreja outlined another study involving “insurance claim data for 7.23 million individuals.”  In this study, he explained, “sildenafil was associated with a 69% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.” While further research is needed into Viagra and vascular dementia, there are lifestyle factors that can make a difference to an individual’s risk. MNT spoke with Dr. Tim Beanland, head of knowledge at the Alzheimer’s Society who was not involved in the study. He outlined some lifestyle risk factors for vascular dementia: “We know that what’s good for the heart is good for the brain, so a healthy diet and lifestyle, including not smoking or drinking too much alcohol, can help to lower your risk of dementia and other conditions like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers.”  For individuals who already have dementia, he told MNT that “there is growing evidence to suggest that regular exercise, looking after your health, and keeping mentally and socially active can help to reduce the progression of dementia symptoms.”  The results of this study suggest that sildenafil may help reduce the risk of vascular dementia in people with CSVD. However, it only measured changes to aspects of cerebral blood flow over a relatively short period of time. To get a clearer picture of whether Viagra and similar drugs truly can reduce risk, scientists will need to follow people for years to assess whether their risk is reduced. Webb plans to continue this line of investigation: “It is very important to follow up on this work. We need to do some further studies to work out the best dose of the drug, and the best drug from this group of drugs to take on further,” he told MNT. “We are aiming to test it in a much larger trial to understand if it not only improves blood flow to the brain but also to test whether this reduces the risk of stroke and dementia,” he added."
23,Robby Berman,Dementia: What’s the link between depression and memory decline?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/depression-may-worsen-memory-decline-older-adults,"A new study demonstrates that depression may worsen memory decline, but one condition may also exacerbate the other. Experts note the pathology of depression and memory loss overlap within the brain.",2024-06-14T15:39:06Z,"A new study demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between depression and memory loss.  Scientists have long known that mood and memory are connected, but this is the first study, its authors say, that specifically investigates the relationship between the two. The study found that people with greater depressive symptoms experienced accelerated memory loss. The researchers note the reverse was also true: Significant memory loss resulted in a higher level of depressive symptoms. In other words, each condition exacerbated the other. The researchers analyzed 16 years of data from 8,268 participants, each of whom was examined in alternating years from 2002–2003 through 2018–2019. These were community-dwelling English adults aged 50 or older, with a mean age of 64 at the start of the study. Of this cohort, 55% were female. “The novel element of our work is that we established that the relationship between memory decline and depression is bidirectional,” senior investigator Dorina Cadar, PhD, a lecturer in neuro-epidemiology and dementia at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom, told Medical News Today. The study is published in JAMA Network Psychiatry. Viewing the two conditions as two sides of the same coin suggests new hope for those living with depression, memory loss, or both. David Merrill, MD, PhD, director of the Brain Health Center at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute, CA, not involved in the study, told MNT that prior to this study, researchers had looked at depression and memory loss independently, “trying to parse them apart as though they’re separate.” But Merrill noted it has long been understood that memory and mood are strongly linked. “If you’re studying memory, you need to control for mood,” Merrill said. “The substrate of the creation of both phenomena is coming out of the same thing,” he added, noting the similarities between depression and dementia. Merrill said the activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are similar in both conditions. When there’s a decrease in frontal lobe activity — as is seen with depression — there is a reduced ability to hold things in working memory, Merrill explained. “The circuitry and the cells and the synapses involved in memory formation have a profound overlap with the circuitry involved in moods, mood regulation, and mood formation,” Merrill said.  Cadar explained that depression and memory have chemistry in common, including the “dysregulation of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which play crucial roles in mood regulation and cognitive abilities.” “In depression, the imbalance of these neurotransmitters can impair synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory formation,” Cadar said. “Serotonin is involved in the modulation of mood and cognition, and its deficit can lead to reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory consolidation.” The growth and survival of neurons in the hippocampus, Cadar continued, can also be threatened by high cortisol levels that often accompany depression. “Prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels can lead to hippocampal atrophy, which is already commonly observed in older individuals with major depressive disorder,” Cadar said, adding that harmful inflammatory responses may result from depression.  “Depression is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines… that can alter neurotransmitter metabolism, reduce synaptic plasticity, and damage brain structures involved in memory such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Inflammation-induced neurotoxicity can, therefore, contribute to cognitive deficits observed in depressed individuals.” — Dorina Cadar, PhD, senior study investigator Finally, depression — especially in older people — can cause insomnia, depriving the brain of the critical memory consolidation that occurs in deep sleep, Cadar noted. Dementia may cause mood and behavioral changes, while depression may lead to forgetfulness, which may cause some confusion around these two very distinct — albeit related — conditions. “Depression, has historically been called ‘pseudo dementia’ in older adults, as it’s been appreciated as sort of a reversible cause of dementia,” Merrill said. Unlike neurodegenerative dementia, which involves the irreversible death of brain cells, “pseudo dementia” stems from depression that causes brain cells to be less active. In depression, less active brain cells could still be reactivated.  “The decrease in brain activity [that occurs with depression] really leads to decreased capacity to form memories,” Merrill said. In addition to all the physiological factors, when a experiences loss in memory capacity, Cadar noted “this cognitive impairment can lead to increased frustration, stress, and feelings of isolation.” “These can trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms and associated loneliness that is equally detrimental for mental abilities,” Cadar said. The findings of this study, have “significant implications for future treatment approaches for both conditions and highlighting the need for integrated treatment approaches rather than treating them in isolation,” Cadar said. Treatment might address both conditions simultaneously, and healthcare providers might develop new early screening programs that monitor older people for both mood and memory. Merrill noted this would require a new interdisciplinary approach, bringing together psychologists and neurologists.  For now, Merrill said it’s imperative for the individual to aim to change one aspect of their mindset, given the nature of depression, if they hope to feel happier and restore memory function. “The problem is depression really robs you of motivation,” he added. According to Merrill, physical activity may be the best course of treatment for both conditions. “Exercise is probably the best single intervention for the aging body and the aging brain,” he said. Merrill proposed a future therapy that could involve consulting with your doctor and getting a prescription for physical therapy (PT). This could provide a helpful structure from which to begin digging your way out of depression while also improving memory. “You have a scheduled appointment with the therapist and you have a trainer who’s happy to see you. All those things are just really activating,” he envisioned. The value of this plan, Merrill said, goes beyond the body and brain health benefits. “You develop friendships, and you develop relationships and bonds. A huge part of depression is this social isolation of losing connectedness,” he noted."
24,Eileen Bailey,Bariatric surgery: Using weight loss drugs beforehand can help,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/obesity-losing-weight-with-medications-such-as-ozempic-can-help-before-bariatric-surgery,Researchers say people with extreme obesity who use weight loss drugs such as Ozempic before bariatric surgery have better outcomes from those procedures,2024-06-14T07:21:00Z,"People with extreme obesity who are considering bariatric surgery may benefit from losing weight with a combination of GLP-1 agonist medications such as Ozempic before their procedure. That’s according to research presented at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery’s 2024 annual scientific meeting. The study, which hasn’t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, included 113 participants with more than 70 of them attempting to lose weight before bariatric surgery through various ways.  Those methods included: The researchers reported that those on multiple medications for between 6 months and 12 months had the most significant weight loss, losing an average of 13% of body weight. Participants taking a single GLP-1 had the second most weight loss (8%), and those using diet and exercise had the least (6%). “I do agree and prefer patients lower their BMI [body mass index] to be in the 50s before surgery,” said Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. “We can’t always use GLPs as they aren’t always covered by insurance and they can be too expensive without the insurance. “In those cases, we have the patient work with a diet counselor,” Ali, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. “Sometimes, we recommend a liquid diet. Losing weight before surgery can be quite helpful. It can provide a jump start to weight loss that continues after the surgery.” “Overall, metabolic surgery is safe – safer than gall bladder surgery, which is considered safe and routine,” Ali added. Researchers said that weight loss before bariatric surgery can lower the risk of complications. The scientists indicated that people with a BMI higher than 70 had the greatest risk of complications. Lifestyle or first-generation medications hadn’t significantly lowered potential complications. “Combining anti-obesity medications may achieve much greater pre-surgery weight loss than other methods for those with extreme obesity,” said Dr. Phil Schauer, the director of the Metamor Metabolic Institute at Pennington Biomedical in Louisiana, said in a press release. “Many patients who would otherwise be considered ‘too sick for surgery’ may now qualify.” Body mass index (BMI) is a ratio of a person’s height to weight that can help estimate body fat. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 and above is considered having obesity. BMI does not account for age, gender, or ethnicity. It also does consider muscle mass. According to Yale Medicine, someone with a high level of muscle and very little fat can have the same BMI as a person with obesity. An athlete or someone who is active can show up in the overweight or obese range when measuring only BMI. Medical professionals using BMI as an overweight/obesity indicator should take into consideration factors such as different ethnicities before using it. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance for using BMI for Asian populations. For example, people in this population with a high risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease show the risk at a substantially lower BMI than white European populations. BMI should be used in conjunction with other risk measurements, such as visceral fat, body adiposity, body composition, genetic factors, and metabolic factors, according to Yale Medicine. In 2022, there were nearly 280,000 metabolic and bariatric surgeries in the United States. This was only about 1% of those who met eligibility for the surgery based on their BMI. Obesity affects about 42% of adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Excess weight can potentially weaken or impair the immune system and increase chronic inflammation. People with obesity are more at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. “More studies are needed to determine the optimal role of GLP-1s before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery among different patient groups,” Dr. Marina Kurian, ASMBS president and a clinical professor in the Department of Surgery, Division of Bariatric Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York who was not involved in the study, said in a press release. “Obesity must be viewed like other chronic diseases where sometimes more than one therapy is necessary over time and for different reasons.”"
25,Erika Watts,Can garlic help lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels?,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/garlic-cholesterol-blood-sugar,A recent meta-analysis of existing studies suggests that garlic consumption could have beneficial effects on a person's cholesterol and blood sugar levels.,2024-06-12T08:00:00Z,"People may face many health issues throughout their lives, and some of the common ones include coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. With both the rise in these diseases and the cost of treatment in mind, researchers are trying to find ways to prevent and treat these diseases in a more cost-effective manner.  This led the scientists in the current study to conduct a meta-analysis of past studies that examined what health impacts garlic can have on blood glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism. The researchers, based in China, extracted data from 29 trials to see how garlic impacts cholesterol, blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and triglycerides.  Their study appears in the journal Nutrients. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes affects millions of people per year. Approximately 11.6% of people in the United States have diabetes.  The CDC also reports that around 86 million adults 20 years and older in the U.S. have elevated cholesterol levels. This can lead to developing heart disease or having a stroke.  One way medical professionals monitor these conditions is by checking blood levels. During a routine checkup, healthcare providers often order blood tests that check the patient’s cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and triglyceride levels.  Depending on the results of these tests, the provider gets an idea of whether someone is in the process of developing a health condition such as diabetes or high cholesterol. For people who are at risk or have developed a condition, doctors can put in place interventions to reduce the chances of developing the disease or treat it with medications and lifestyle changes.  The researchers in the current study were curious whether garlic could impact lipid levels and blood glucose levels.  Garlic has a compound called allicin, which a previous review study reported to have properties such as being antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral. A prior study also showed that allicin was effective at lowering cholesterol in an animal trial.  To see whether garlic can improve blood glucose and lipid metabolism, the researchers analyzed 22 studies meeting their criteria, which included 29 trials to focus on for their meta-analysis. These trials involved a total of 1,567 participants from different countries and age groups.  To qualify for inclusion, trials needed to use garlic as an intervention for more than 2 weeks and report on HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides.  The researchers also only considered studies with participants ages 18 and older and studies with control groups.  The researchers in the various trials administered garlic in different forms: Depending on the trial, some participants consumed 300 to 22,400 milligrams (mg) of garlic powder per day, while other preparations ranged from 800 to 4,200 mg daily. At the end of those trials, the researchers collected information on the participants’ blood levels to compare to their baseline levels.  The researchers conducting the current meta-analysis used all these data to see whether garlic consumption could improve metabolic markers.  The meta-analysis found a significant association between garlic intervention and improvement in different metabolic markers.  Garlic supplementation lowered fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol — also referred to as “bad cholesterol.” Additionally, the garlic intervention increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, also known as “good cholesterol.”  “Elevated fasting blood glucose and HbA1c are characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus,” note the authors, highlighting the significance of these findings. The researchers also said that the longer the garlic intervention trial lasted, the more improvement participants saw in their fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.  While the researchers found improvements in other blood markers, they did not find an impact on triglyceride levels.  The study findings show that garlic interventions may have the potential for use in either preventing or managing some cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.  “The intervention of garlic is beneficial to control blood glucose and blood lipids in humans,” write the authors. Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, discussed the research — in which he was not involved — with Medical News Today. “This meta-analysis included many different trials that studied the effects of garlic,” said Chen. “However, these studies varied quite a bit in their designs, and thus do not allow us to pinpoint the exact active compounds that could be responsible for garlic’s beneficial effects.”  Chen further noted that experts believe “garlic has beneficial effects on blood sugar control and cholesterol levels through its sulfur-based compounds, such as allicin, alliin, and diallyl disulfide,” but that more research is necessary to learn exactly how it works.  “This study is unlikely to change our specific dietary recommendations, but it should be noted that garlic would be considered a nutritious and healthy addition to any diet,” he told us. Edwin Bosa-Osorio, MD, a faculty member in the Family Medicine Program at the Brodes H. Hartley, Jr. Teaching Health Center at Community Health of South Florida, also spoke with MNT and discussed the study’s strengths and weaknesses. Bosa-Osorio was not involved in the current research either. “While the findings are interesting and bear further study, this is not what we would call a ‘high-powered’ study given the low sample numbers and limited durations,” he explained. Bosa-Osorio pointed out that many of the trials included in the study meta-analysis had a low participant level, saying that “[of]f those 22 studies, many had low sample sizes, the highest being below 200 persons studied, and others numbering only a hundred or so.” He also did not foresee any changes to dietary recommendations in the near future: “If these indications are truly valid, pending further studies, there could be an impact on dietary recommendations. But right now, when it comes to primary prevention for heart disease and type 2 diabetes, we already have proven very highly effective treatments and primary preventative methods.”"
26,Jessica Freeborn,Heart disease: Millions may no longer get preventive statin therapy,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17-million-us-adults-may-no-longer-receive-statin-therapy-for-heart-disease,"The American Heart Association recently updated its risk equations for predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease events, which means that millions of Americans may soon no longer qualify for preventive statin therapy.",2024-06-14T15:27:58Z,"Doctors have to make tough choices about prescribing medications, weighing the potential risks and benefits. They typically use official recommendations from governing bodies and relevant medical organizations to help guide their clinical practice recommendations. Groups update these guidelines based on components like newly available data. Researchers want to understand how these guideline changes affect clinical practice and medication recommendations. A study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicinelooked at two equation sets to measure 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk and how they affected primary prevention statin therapy recommendations. Researchers used a weighted sample of 3,785 adults. The results indicated that using the one equation set, PREVENT, greatly reduced the average estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The researchers calculated that using PREVENT equations could also decrease the number of adults who meet eligibility criteria for primary prevention statin use from 45.4 million to 28.3 million. The results suggest major changes could occur in the number of people prescribed statins if the PREVENT equations are used. As noted by the American Heart Association, “atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is caused by the buildup of plaque within the arteries, limiting the flow of blood to important organs.” Several atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related conditions can lead to serious bodily harm, such as heart attacks and strokes. Sometimes, doctors may prescribe statins to people who are at particular risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins are also sometimes prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels. Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, not involved in the current research explained to Medical News Today that “[s]tatins are commonly used in clinical practice in two scenarios: In people who have already suffered a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke, or in people with risk factors for developing heart disease.” “For people who have already had a heart attack or stroke, we recommend a ‘high-intensity’ statin, such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin,” he told us. “For everyone else, the decision to start a statin depends on our evaluation of their risk for developing cardiovascular disease in the future. This includes an assessment of their risk factors for heart disease, such as a high blood pressure and/or diabetes. To help us decide whether to start someone on a statin, we will frequently use a risk calculator to estimate someone’s 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease.” – Cheng-Han Chen, MD The researchers who conducted the current study explain that the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology initially developed pooled cohort equations (PCEs) in 2013. These equations helped calculate a person’s estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, these equations may not be entirely accurate, particularly for groups that were underrepresented in the initial cohorts that derived the PCEs. In 2023, the American Heart Association Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Scientific Advisory Group developed a new set of equations to predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This set of equations, the PREVENT equations, does not include race but instead adds in other measurements like kidney function, the social deprivation index, and statin use. The current cross-sectional study looked at how the PCEs and PREVENT equations differ in risk prediction and recommendations for primary prevention statin therapy. Researchers used data from the United States’ National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). They included adults aged between 40 and 75 who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The sample size, 3,785 adults, was representative of the U.S. population. Researchers analyzed the data using both equation groups — PCEs and PREVENT equations — to examine 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. However, they did not include data on the social deprivation index because this was unavailable through the survey data. They used the 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines to determine primary prevention statin therapy eligibility criteria. These guidelines recommend statin therapy for adults between forty and seventy-five who have diabetes, high cholesterol levels, or an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of 7.5% or more. They were then able to calculate the number and proportion of U.S. adults who would experience changes in statin recommendations based on the PCEs to PREVENT equation differences. The study found that the estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease went from 8% using PCEs to 4.3% using PREVENT equations. They observed the most drastic difference for Black adults, whose risk went from 10.9% to 5.1%, and adults between 70 and 75, whose risk went from 22.8% to 10.2%. Thus, the use of PREVENT equations could lead to a general shift into lower-risk categories for a number of individuals. Researchers further estimated that the statin recommendations for U.S. adults would drop from 45.4 million to 28.3 million with a change from PCEs to PREVENT equations. They also noted that many adults eligible to take statins based on PREVENT equations were not taking statins, equating to 15.8 million adults. This research does have some limitations. First, data from NHANES relies on self-reporting, and not everyone responds to the survey, which can lead to errors. Data collection also did not note the dosage of statin medications, medication adherence, or changes in HDL cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the researchers did not stratify atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk by other risk enhancers, or examine the use of other lipid-lowering therapies. The researchers did include individuals with certain outlier values for both calculators, even though clinical practice usually excludes these individuals. Another issue was that the authors were not able to look at LDL cholesterol levels separately in their primary analysis although they did take it into account in sensitivity analyses. Thus, they could have underestimated statin eligibility at the population level. The researchers note that they could not determine which risk score is most accurate in today’s practice, so more studies are needed to determine the most helpful risk-assessment equations in clinical practice. They further note that doctors could consider moving away from precise treatment thresholds and towards better risk communication with people. Chen commented that it could also lead to changing risk thresholds. He explained to MNT that: “Depending on how future guidelines are written, this could result in fewer patients being recommended statin therapy. As statins are known to be very helpful in preventing cardiovascular disease, any future guidelines may need to adjust the risk thresholds we use for starting statin therapy.” Regular use of PREVENT equations could also mean doctors utilize additional tests to make recommendations.  Michael Broukhim, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, also not involved in the current research, emphasized that “[t]he potential clinical implications are there may be an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events if less patients are treated for hyperlipidemia.” “Utilizing additional testing, such as coronary artery calcium scoring or lipoprotein a testing, may be more important to decide whether patients would benefit from statin therapy,” he advised."
27,Bob Curley,Lung cancer: Why non-smokers don't respond to treatments,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-many-people-with-lung-cancer-who-have-never-smoked-dont-respond-well-to-treatments,Researchers have honed in on two genetic mutations they say may be responsible for the treatment-resistant tumors in people with lung cancer who have never smoked,2024-06-13T08:27:00Z,"Non-smokers who develop non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be unusually resistant to treatment for the disease. Researchers say they think genetic mutations may be the cause. Their findings were published today in the journal Nature Communications. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, but not all people who get lung cancer are smokers. In fact, 10% to 20% of people who get lung cancer have never smoked, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The causes of lung cancer among people who have never smoked remain unclear, but experts suspect a combination of environmental, genetic, and lifestyle-related factors play a role.  Lung cancer among non-smokers is the fifth leading cause of death in the world, according to Dr. Eric Singhi, an assistant professor of thoracic head and neck medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “All you need to be at risk for lung cancer is to have lungs,” Singhi, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. Targeted treatment is available for non-small cell lung cancer. However, researchers from University College London, the Francis Crick Institute, and drugmaker AstraZeneca found that the combination of two genetic mutations may explain why standard treatment is often ineffective among non-smokers. Targeted treatment fails in 10% to 15% patients, depending upon what kind of NCSLC is being treated, Dr. Manmeet Singh Ahluwalia of the Baptist Health Miami Cancer Institute who was not involved in the study told Medical News Today In their new study, researchers reported that a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) — present in up to half of non-smokers with NCSLC — combined with a mutation in the p53 gene resulted in the development of drug-resistant tumors. Researchers said that the only about a third of people with stage IV NSCLC and an EGFR mutation survive for up to three years. EGFR enables cancer cells to grow more quickly, whereas the p53 gene plays a role in tumor suppression.  Typically, NSCLC is treated with drugs called EGFR inhibitors, but the study found while tumors in people with just the EGFR mutations got smaller in response to treatment, some tumors actually grew after treatment among those with both the EGFR and p53 mutations. Lab and animal studies found that these growing, drug-resistant tumors had more cancer cells that had doubled their genome, giving them extra copies of all their chromosomes. In addition, cells with both the double mutation and double genomes were more likely to multiply into new drug-resistant cells. “We’ve shown why having a p53 mutation is associated with worse survival in patients with non-smoking related lung cancer, which is the combination of EGFR and p53 mutations enabling genome doubling,” said Charles Swanton, PhD, a study co-author and a professor at the UCL Cancer Institute and deputy clinical director at the Francis Crick Institute, said in a statement. “This increases the risk of drug-resistant cells developing through chromosomal instability.” “While whole genome doubling itself may not always cause cancer, it can contribute to cancer growth and disease progression in various ways,” added Singh. Researchers noted that while non-small cell lung cancer patients are tested for EGFR and p53 mutations, there is no test currently available that can detect this dangerous genome doubling. Work on such a test is under way, however. “Once we can identify patients with both EGFR and p53 mutations whose tumors display whole genome doubling, we can then treat these patients in a more selective way,” said Crispin Hiley, PhD, a study co-author and an associate professor at the UCL Cancer Institute. “This might mean more intensive follow-up, early radiotherapy or ablation to target resistant tumors, or early use of combinations of EGFR inhibitors, such as (AstraZeneca’s) osimertinib, with other drugs including chemotherapy.” “Treatment strategies such as combination therapies (targeted therapy plus another treatment) have begun to emerge, aimed at preventing the emergence of resistance to a treatment,” said Singhi. He noted that these include using osimertinib in combination with conventional chemotherapy or amivantamab, an bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, a gene that manufactures a protein involved in cellular signaling, growth, and survival. “These trials are looking to prove whether two types of treatments together and upfront, offer better clinical outcomes for our patients than one targeted therapy alone,” he said. “A very valid concern, however, is that combination therapies tend to be more toxic for our patients, and it can be difficult to discern which patient would benefit more one therapy versus another.” Dr. Shuresh Ramalingam, an executive director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Georgia and a non-small cell lung cancer expert who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that new therapies can be tailored to address NSCLC cases where EGFR inhibitors are ineffective. “When targeted treatments stop working, it is not uncommon for physicians to conduct molecular testing to determine if there are new mutations in the tumor,” said Ramalingam, who is currently working on a new intervention for treating Stage III NSCLC tumors that cannot be removed surgically. “This knowledge informs appropriate interventions that could overcome the resistance mechanism. For example, for patients with EGFR mutation, a known resistance mechanism with targeted therapy is a new mutation known as the C797S mutation. There are new experimental drugs that are capable of overcoming this specific resistance mechanism in clinical trials.” The proportion of lung cancers occurring in individuals who have never smoked has increased in the past several decades, particularly among women and in younger age groups, said Ahluwalia.  “Approximately two-thirds of [these] cases occur in women, making women who have not smoked more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer than men who have not smoked,” he said."
28,Katharine Lang,Colorectal cancer: How Metformin could help slow cancer cell growth,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/metformin-slows-colorectal-cancer-cell-growth,A new cell study has shown the common type 2 diabetes medication metformin alters levels of microRNAs that target genes to slow down the growth and multiplication of colorectal cancer cells. The researchers say their findings could lead to new RNA therapeutic…,2024-06-14T15:46:11Z,"Metformin is a common treatment for type 2 diabetes, either alone or in combination with other drugs.  This widely prescribed medication helps regulate blood glucose and has other beneficial health effects. These may include: A recent study published in Cancers examined metformin’s anti-cancer properties. Using colorectal cancer cells, researchers found molecular pathways that may explain metformin’s anti-cancer effects. The researchers treated HCT116 colorectal cancer cells — a highly aggressive type of cancer cell line — with a sub-lethal dose (2.5mM) of metformin. Using several different techniques to analyze the drug’s effects on the cells’ RNA, they found that metformin altered the activity of some microRNAs (miRNAs, which are short, single-stranded lengths of RNA that regulate genes). Some were upregulated, meaning their activity increased; others were downregulated. “In this particular study, there is some suggestion that metformin may play a role in the downregulation of genes specific to colon cancer,” Nilesh Vora, MD, board certified hematologist and medical oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, told Medical News Today.  It’s a novel mechanism that may have implications in other cancers. Since metformin is a relatively harmless and low-cost drug, this may have a tremendous impact on other cancers,” Vora noted. Metformin is a widely available therapy for type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of which is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045. The medication helps the body respond to insulin — the hormone that controls blood glucose. It also decreases the amount of sugar that the liver produces and that the intestines or stomach absorb. However, studies have not yet uncovered the precise mechanisms underlying these effects. , surgical oncologist, and the chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John’s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, explained to MNT: “Metformin is typically used to treat type 2 diabetes and although it has been shown to have an anti-cancer effect the mechanism has not been well understood. This study provides a possible mechanism through micro RNAs inhibiting cell growth and proliferation. This is particularly important since it opens the potential to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting these micro RNAs.” Two upregulated miRNAs — miR-2110 and miR-132-3p — directly targeted a gene signaling pathway often disrupted in human cancers. This slowed down the rate at which the cancer cells grew and multiplied.  Another two miRNAs — miR-222-3p and miR-589-3p — targeted another pathway, which resulted in suppressed cell growth and delaying of the cell cycle. If similar effects are seen in tumors in people and not just cells, these findings with metformin could potentially lead to alternative treatments for some cancers. “Metformin has been available for a long time and is relatively inexpensive,” Bilchik said. “There is potential for its use to be extended to other cancers, but more important, this study provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic agents.”  The researchers caution that their findings were in isolated cells that were cultured in a high-glucose medium, which does not exactly mimic the conditions found in the human body.  However, they recommend that their experiments be repeated using cells cultured in media that more closely resemble the physiological nutrient levels found in tumors. RNA therapeutics are a new approach to cancer treatment. Research shows that noncoding RNAs (which include the microRNAs in this study) are dysregulated in many types of cancer, including:  Some miRNAs increase the likelihood of cancers, others decrease it, and the same miRNA can have different effects on different cancers. MiRNAs have two advantages over other cancer treatments — they are naturally occurring molecules in cells and they target several genes in one pathway. This means that they can cause a broad, but specific response. Currently, several studies are investigating the use of miRNAs as cancer therapeutics, particularly how they can be delivered into cells. This study provides new insights into metformin’s effect on the molecular mechanisms inside cells and why it reduces proliferation of cancer cells, emphasising the role of miRNAs in colorectal cancer.  The authors suggest their findings highlight the potential for developing RNA therapeutics for cancer prevention and treatment and possibly for targeted interventions. Although there are several challenges in the field of miRNA therapeutics, this study could signal another step in their development as potential cancer treatments."
