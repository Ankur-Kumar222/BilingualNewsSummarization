If you’re just a casual follower of the dumb phone market, the announcement might come as something of a surprise. After all, the Light Phone II is still selling briskly, even remaining back-ordered at some retailers an impressive five years after its initial release. (Regarding the II, the company says, “Planned obsolescence remains an outrage to us,” and that they will “continue to sell, support, and service our older models.”)  The Light Phone III is available for pre-order now and expected to ship in January 2025. Designed to “make going light even easier,” it comes loaded with a few added features that many Light Phone users are sure to find compelling. A chunkier, bulkier metal frame adds to the phone’s durability, backing up the brand’s vow to design products that last virtually forever.  Plus, LPIII pivots from e-ink to a larger matte AMOLED display to improve performance while still restricting distraction. They’ve also added a camera with a “genuinely fun” dedicated shutter button and further future-proofed the design with a USB-C port, fingerprint ID, 5G, and an NFC chip to support digital payments. With QR codes still swarming restaurant menus (hate), cashless POS taking over cafes, and endless group chats continuing to be inescapable features of modern life, these are significant improvements to be sure. But according to Will Stults, co-founder of dumbwireless , the Light Phone II will still attract its fair share of devotees: “The E-ink aesthetic is what a lot of people adore about the current Light Phone.”  So, I guess the question now is: how light do you want to go? Light Phone III is available for pre-order now. It’s currently priced at $399, which is expected to go up to $799 after July 15, 2024. If you’re interested, we’d recommend getting yours before then, for obvious reasons."

The hope is to give a “gentle push” to the nearly “70 percent of people who want to get married” but aren’t “actively joining events or apps to look for a partner,” one government official told Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun. Tokyo’s government isn’t taking matchmaking lightly: The app will entail a scrupulous registration process, in which users will have to provide documentation to prove they are “legally single” and willing to get married.  Alongside this, potential procreators will be required to produce 15 pieces of personal info—including height, occupation, and educational background—all of which will be visible to other users. And, just to make things extra romantic, an official tax certificate to verify their annual salary. The city has already invested $1.28 million into the app, which is due to be launched this summer. It comes amid a population crisis that Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called the “gravest crisis our country faces.” Births have fallen for the eighth year in a row to 758,631, a drop of around 5 percent.  In 2023, Japan had more than twice as many deaths as it did new babies. The country is now one of the world’s oldest societies, with population projected to fall by another 30 percent to 87 million by 2070, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. The primary cause of this rapid decline is thought to be lower marriage rates. In Tokyo, marriage rates are lowest of all, at 32 percent for men and 24 percent for women. In a press briefing earlier this year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that the next few years “will be the last chance to reverse the trend.” “If there are many individuals interested in marriage but unable to find a partner, we want to provide support,” a Tokyo government official told The Asahi Shimbun. “We hope that this app, with its association with the government, will provide a sense of security and encourage those who have been hesitant to use traditional apps to take the first step in their search for a partner.” Government-sanctioned Tinder may not sound like a meet-cute, but it does have a pretty big advantage: Commercial dating apps aren’t actually “designed to be deleted”—finding a long-term partner removes you from the customer base. Sorry to burst your bubble, but all those times you sadly re-downloaded Hinge were all part of the business model. Tokyo’s app really does have people’s best baby-making interests at heart."
2,"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper",The Pioneering Cyber Detective Who Cracked a 30-Year-Old Cold Case,https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg59dk/tent-girl-cold-case-cyber-detective-todd-matthews,"In the 1990s, Todd Matthews used the internet to help solve the “Tent Girl” mystery, one of the first cases of its kind.",2024-06-13T18:15:57Z,"Todd Matthews was one of the first “cyber detectives.” An amateur sleuth who used the internet to solve the decades-old Tent Girl mystery, he later launched the Doe Network, a nonprofit that works with law enforcement to solve missing persons cases. A few years ago, VICE interviewed Matthews about his work in the 1990s, which inspired thousands of amateur detectives to go online to investigate missing-person cases and unsolved crimes worldwide.  Matthews was only 17 when he started his first case, seeking the identity of “Tent Girl,” a young woman who’d been found dead wrapped in a canvas sheet. “I first heard of the story ‘The Tent Girl’ in 1987,” he said, noting that his future wife had just moved to Tennessee from Kentucky. “It was near Halloween, so we were telling ghost stories. She explained how her father had found a body on the side of the road wrapped in a canvas tent wrapper and how a grave had been created with her image on it.” “No name,” he continued. “Just ‘Tent Girl.’ That just stuck with me.” Matthews’s brother and sister had passed away when they were infants—no stranger to tragic loss, he felt ‘Tent Girl’ deserved to be identified. “I think it was really obsessive right from the get-go,” he said. “The process of trying to find out who she was immediately began.” From there, he scoured newspaper and magazine articles to discover any sliver of information that might help him further the case.  “Some of the biggest obstacles in the story were getting information,” he said. “Everything was hard copy.” Back then, much of the research had to be done in person: visiting Tent Girl’s grave, picking up hard copies of articles, and interviewing sources—including his father-in-law, who remembered things differently than the news articles. “The newspaper described her as pretty much a child, but he said he actually saw her, and he felt that she was possibly older,” Matthews said. “So there were some data conflicts immediately.” “It was more than an obsession. It felt like an obligation.” –Todd Matthews Matthews told VICE that the story became so haunting that he even experienced vivid dreams of the missing woman. Though he began researching this case when he was only a teenager, his dedication to solving the mystery persevered for several years. “By this point in time, it was having an effect on my marriage,” he said. “Racking up telephone bills that were difficult to pay. Arguments that were difficult to win. Rationalizing doing this with no results. “At what point do you say ‘enough’s enough’?” he asked. “It was more than an obsession. It felt like an obligation.” He heard of the internet around the mid-90s and recognized it as a tool. In 1997, he created a website, which you can still visit on the Internet Archive, including all the information he’d collected about her and her case over the last decade. Because he had a family at this time, he did most of his research at night while everyone was asleep, explaining that he “snuck off to my little office.” Eventually, while searching “missing sister, missing this, missing that,” he found several databases—one relevant to the case. “I did find a note where a lady in Arkansas was looking for her missing sister, last known to be in Lexington, Kentucky—a very short distance away—in December of 1967,” he said. “It was very clear at the time that that’s who I was looking for.” The Tent Girl ended up being Barbara Hackmann Taylor. She had remained unidentified for nearly 30 years after her body was found. However, thanks to Matthews, her family and loved ones were able to gain some closure. “After the resolution of the Tent Girl case, the cybercommunity lit up,” Matthews told VICE in the documentary. “I heard from missing persons advocates from all over the world, and I helped in the development of the first database for missing and unidentified persons.” Through his nonprofit, Matthews and other volunteer internet sleuths worked with law enforcement to reach resolutions and connect missing persons cases with John/Jane Doe cases. “I was blinded by trying to find what I needed that I didn’t realize that some foundational work was being done,” Matthews revealed. “That time I spent wasn’t just time wasted. There was success in what I was trying to do, and in fact, it left a footprint. It repurposed the use of the internet.”  Matthews passed away earlier this year at the young age of 53. However, his contributions to the cyber detective community will live on forever."
3,"VICE Staff, Kev Kharas",The College Student Who Lived a Secret Double Life as a Millionaire Crypto Bandit,https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy39xj/the-college-student-who-lived-a-secret-double-life-as-a-millionaire-crypto-bandit,"Joel Ortiz, a socially isolated teenager, stole millions of dollars in crypto by hijacking his victims’ mobile phones.",2024-06-14T13:31:02Z,"In May 2018, Darren Marble was attending a cryptocurrency conference in New York City when he discovered he had become a victim of a new and financially devastating form of crime. The first sign that something was amiss was when Marble, an executive producer for a streaming series, started having issues with his mobile phone. He couldn’t connect to email, or send a text. It wasn’t until later that night when he got back to his hotel room, logged into the wifi and investigated further that his worst fears were realized. His crypto wallet had been drained. “I'd lost $100,000 of cryptocurrency instantaneously,” he said. “I just remember thinking, ‘This can't be real.’” Marble called his wife in a panic, feeling a sense of hopelessness and shame as he explained what had happened. The money was gone, he could see it had been transferred into other people’s wallets, but he couldn’t tell who those wallets belonged to, because the whole point of cryptocurrency was its anonymity. “I just remember having this sinking feeling in my heart. I felt guilty, I felt ashamed, I felt naive, and I felt embarrassed,” he said. “Then I wondered, ‘What's gonna happen next?’ Who do you call when you get hacked for cryptocurrency?” Marble didn’t know it yet, but he was the victim of a new and growing form of cyber crime called “sim swapping,” that’s been linked to huge crypto heists in which millions of dollars have been stolen. Chart the rise and fall of Joel Ortiz in our brand new documentary – The Crypto Bandit: The technique involves a hacker tricking or bribing a cellphone carrier employee to redirect the victim's phone number to a different phone, giving the hacker access to all their calls and messages, allowing them to reset their passwords and, ultimately, empty their accounts. The hacker holding the phone that was used to steal Marble’s crypto was Joel Ortiz: an 18-year-old college student who, from his mother’s Boston apartment, would go on to steal more than $7.5 million in this way. Ortiz, an isolated teen whose only social connections were online, would go on to splurge large amounts of the money he stole from high-value crypto investors on a lavish luxury lifestyle, a world removed from his modest upbringing as the son of a disabled, immigrant solo mother. The story of Ortiz’s remarkable crime wave, and the team of investigators who would eventually bring him to justice, is told in The Crypto Bandit – a new documentary in VICE’s Cowboy Kings of Crypto series. “Ortiz was a brainy guy,” said Erin West, deputy district attorney in Santa Clara County, California, where Ortiz would eventually be charged, becoming the first person sentenced for “sim swap” offending in the US. “He graduated as valedictorian of his class and got a scholarship to UMass. And we know that he had skills that were really usable in this way. He exploited a vulnerability that I don't think the rest of the nation was really thinking much about.” Known online by the handle @0, Ortiz operated as part of a hacker ring, working with online associates to pull off his audacious crimes. Investigators say he and others in the gang targeted individuals publicly associated with the crypto world, drawing up lists of rich potential targets in the hope of catching a “whale.” With one victim in particular, Ortiz and his fellow hackers would hit the jackpot. Saswata Basu is a Silicon Valley-based founder of a company that raised capital from the crypto market, who would also find himself a victim of Ortiz’s scams. Like Marble, he would discover he was being hacked when his phone started displaying messages about his passwords being changed. But the scale of the theft from Basu would dwarf Marble’s losses. “There was one wallet... which was hacked,” he told VICE. “The amount was about $5 million.” Ortiz flaunted his new wealth on social media: buying Gucci outfits and designer goods, and renting luxury mansions in Los Angeles to party in. “If you're an 18-year-old kid and you just stole $5 million, what would you do with that money?” said Samy Tarazi, a criminal investigator in the Santa Clara district attorney’s office. Tarazi was a member of REACT, an elite taskforce that had been formed in California to tackle this kind of cybercrime. “The answer is always something dumb. He had traveled from Boston to Hollywood and had rented out Airbnbs.” Ortiz’s habit of posting his wild lifestyle on social media would only help investigators, and he was eventually arrested at LAX airport, as he prepared to board a flight to Europe. In April 2019, he was given a 10-year sentence after pleading no contest to eight counts of identity theft and computer crimes. He is currently serving his sentence at Centinela Prison in California, and is due to be released in 2028. But the bulk of the stolen millions in crypto remains unaccounted for, having been laundered by his gang in a process that makes the funds virtually untraceable. Tarazi and West said that, when arrested, Ortiz showed them about $250,000 in cryptocurrency, and had probably blown about the same amount in his excessive spending. “There was a huge gap between what he could account for and what we knew he took,” said West. For Marble, there was an unexpected silver lining. Long after the theft, he received an unexpected email from the High Court in Ireland, informing him that one of Ortiz’s co-conspirators–a Dublin-based hacker named Conor Freeman–had been arrested, and the money that had been stolen from him recovered. Freeman was sentenced in November 2020 to two years and 11 months in prison. “It was another, just surreal moment,” said Marble, who was returned $90,000 of the stolen crypto. “I was basically made whole right there.” But most victims weren’t so lucky. The whereabouts of millions of dollars stolen by the hacker gang remained a mystery, said Tarazi. “We don't know if they gave it to trusted third parties we haven't identified, [or] they have it buried in a forest somewhere and they'll get it when they get out of prison,” he said. “I don't know.”"

Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, the list goes on. For weed smokers in the UK, the martyr right now is a 54-year-old pothead called Gary Youds. Youds owns a cannabis cafe called the Chillin’ Rooms on Holt Road in Liverpool—a stone’s throw from Anfield football stadium—where members are encouraged to chill, smoke weed, and have a laugh. For operating this service, Youds has been sent to prison four times. In February this year, he was released from a three-year prison sentence related to the running of the cafe. And now, he’s at it again. “The potheads have been discriminated against for too long,” Youds tells VICE. “All revolutionaries go to jail. But cannabis brings community together, that’s why I’ve always gone back to it. I want to build a golden bridge so the authorities can retreat from the war on drugs.” His trailblazing crusade started in 2002, when he first applied to Liverpool council to convert a former taxi office into a “private members’ club” for cannabis smokers. When councillors rejected his proposals, the former property developer did it anyway, opening the Amsterdam-style coffee shop in 2005 and selling cannabis grown by himself and other locals. It quickly garnered around 400 regular members, who would hang out, play pool, attend jam nights, and “stay medicated and live the dream” as a sign inside read. On some days, Youds sold more than 1KG of weed, raking in more than $13,000. The utopia didn’t last long, though. “We are doing nothing wrong, all we want is tolerance,"" Youds told the Liverpool Echo in 2005, when he first received heat from the authorities. In April 2006, he was raided by police for defying a council closure notice—it would be the first of around 20 raids on his property over the following years. Youds was sentenced to a year in prison and, in the courtroom, the nickname the “cannabis martyr” stuck. The Chillin’ Rooms remained closed for nearly a decade afterwards, but Youds relaunched his holy war permanently in 2015, inspired by cannabis legalisation across the U.S. that he believes has shown him to be a pioneer.  He spent two more stints in jail, plus a few weeks for a probation violation, until his most recent release this year. Youds (right) at a UK Cannabis Social Club event. Photo: Supplied by interviewee His martyrdom motivations aren’t driven solely by a desire to get high. He medicates with cannabis for his arthritis, and has supplied cancer patients with cannabis free of charge to ease their pain. Before he was sentenced to his latest jail term, Youds told the judge he’d been “saving the city by producing the fruits of the earth for the people.” In fact, Youds says his most recent arrest took place while he was delivering cannabis oil to a terminal cancer patient in Birmingham. Police then raided his house and found what the Merseyside police force estimated to be around £7,000 worth of cannabis. Youds said in an interview with La Vida Liverpool that the police even arrested his mum on one occasion. On other occasions, he claims to have been manhandled out of the cafe by officers during violent police assaults, causing physical and emotional trauma. “They jump out of hire vans, like 20 [officers],” he says. “I’ve been through that many raids you wouldn’t believe it. The last time they came in here they actually sprayed me with mace and carried me out upside down and smashed my glasses. They’ve kidnapped me in the middle of the night and put me in Walton [prison] because I had a flat battery [on his tag].” Youds says he has been treated despicably by the authorities, but that he wants to move on and focus on the positives. “I’ve given people jobs and reduced crime,” he said in an interview. “Why make me an evil person in the eyes of the law when I work hard and enjoy a smoke,” he said. “I am a good father of two, a good person in society … It is ridiculous, unfair and illogical to demonise cannabis.” Since reopening his refurbished premises on April 20, the most important day in the stoner calendar, the father-of-two has been doing things by the book, thanks to the 2018 legalisation of medical cannabis that enshrined the legality of vaporising prescribed flowers in public. Recently, legal medical cannabis lounges have sprung up on UK high streets, providing a potential blueprint for bona fide public toking. “They’ve got to have a medical prescription,” Youds says of his patrons. It marks a departure from his previous free-for-all, but how can you blame a man for wanting to avoid a fifth prison stint? Business is slow since he stopped selling cannabis, and visitors must now sign up via The Cannabis App. Locals are also wary of outing themselves as weed-carrying stoners in the establishment too, since previous raids have seen dozens of Chillin’ Rooms clients given police cautions. Youds is now only bringing in cash from beverage and snack sales, plus the £5 entry fee, and must close early when it's only him on shift as he is wearing a police tag again. Youds visiting the House of Lords in the UK. Photo: Supplied by interviewee But he’s not too concerned. “I’m happy just meeting the people and providing a safe space,” he says. “Just being in there, it's out of this world. The lighting, the mood, I just love being there. It's a kind of paradise: I’m planning to run it for the rest of my life.” The reverence in which the UK cannabis reform community holds Youds is real. A #FreeGaryYouds song was recorded by a Liverpool rapper during his most recent prison sentence, and fellow cannabis campaigners have spoken out in his defence, along with his family. “Millions of pounds have been wasted persecuting, prosecuting, and imprisoning Gary and others like him,” wrote podcaster Simpa Carter. “The world and the British public’s attitude towards cannabis have evolved and changed over the two decades Gary [Youds] has been trying to lawfully open and operate ‘The Chillin Rooms.’” Another supporter recently said of him: “He’s the Phoenix, he’s Rocky, he just keeps on coming back.” Judge David Swinnerton was less than impressed, though, asserting in 2023 that Youds had “deliberately chosen to flout the law time after time”. Swinnerton acknowledged that Youds partly did all this out of a genuine belief in the medical properties of cannabis – not just greed and a desire for money – but urged him to campaign in legal ways. “You are wasting your life going to prison,” said Swinnerton. “You are just going to end up going back to prison. It is not helping anybody.” There are still risks in running legal medical cannabis lounges, thanks to the police’s apparent inability to accept that the right to vaporise prescribed cannabis in public is enshrined in law. In April, Smokey Joe’s Medicinal Cannabis Consumption Lounge in Kidderminster, Worcestershire – which aims to provide medical cannabis consumers with “a safe, judgement free space to medicate” – was raided by police and a man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis. Many town centres in the UK are shadows of their former selves, with boarded-up shops and tumbleweeds aplenty. But legalising cannabis, which Germany just did, following other EU states Malta and Luxembourg, could create a multi-billion-pound windfall for the legal economy, according to Youds. “I want to bring the ‘high’ back to the high street, in partnership with nature,” he says. Whether Youds will join the pantheon of eternal martyrs who changed the world remains to be seen. But he has already changed his home city, Liverpool, and written himself into the story of the UK’s continuing journey towards legal cannabis. “I’ve been constantly terrorised by the police, always worrying about undercover cops, but I will never give up, and now I’ve won.” @matthamundo"
5,"Melanie A. Davis, Duncan Cooper",Weekly Horoscope: June 9 - June 15,https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvjk7w/weekly-horoscope-june-9-june-15,Guard your emotions extra closely this week.,2024-06-10T15:31:49Z,"The celestial traffic jam in the 9th House of Philosophy continues this week. But as the waxing Moon flies further away from the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter, it will form tense squares that can bring up negative feelings and conflict. It might be wise to guard your emotions extra closely this week and consider how your words affect others.  Classifying our emotional needs as secondary might be tempting, particularly in a society that prioritizes logistics devoid of sentimentality. However, as several signs’ cosmic alignments show, our internal environment affects virtually every aspect of our external one—including how we perceive it. Emotional regulation is critical for overall stability.  How will your sign fare this week?  Emotional and mental clutter isn’t that much different from physical clutter. Both hinder our ability to move forward and make space in our homes—or, in the former’s case, our hearts. As your ruling planet, Mars, forms an auspicious trine with a first-quarter Moon toward the end of the week, the urge to release old habits and feelings will peak.  As painful of a process as this can be, try to focus on the positives. Think of the extra room you’ll have for new friendships, relationships, and other opportunities when you’re no longer wading through the mess of past grudges and insecurities. The discomfort of the transition is temporary, but the benefits of making it are long-lasting.  There’s only so much pushing back against the tide of the universe you can do before the cosmos will make the change for you. Would you rather wait for that moment to arise or handle it on your terms? Rest assured that digging in your heels and ignoring the facts laid out plainly before you won’t make this problem go away.  For someone as self-sufficient as you, it might be alluring to rebel against reality. But just because something seems more appealing doesn’t mean it’s the option worth pursuing. The card deck is closed, Taurus. It’s time to play the hand you were dealt.  Despite what your people-pleasing tendencies try to tell you, not every relationship is worth keeping. The stars urge you to look at your inner circle this week and consider how these individuals make you feel. Do you leave your interactions with them empowered and enlightened or frustrated and put down?  If it’s the latter, then perhaps it’s time to reconsider your relationship—or, at the very least, how much of your time and energy you choose to dedicate to them. You still have options if you’re unwilling to let them go, but the best ones will involve difficult conversations around accountability. Only you can decide if it’s worth the effort.  Don’t underestimate the ability of your external environment to impact your internal well-being. When you’re constantly distracted by work and other stressors, it can seem all too easy to compartmentalize everything. However, we can manufacture only so much separation between our surroundings and our mental and emotional state.  Prepare for events early in the week to highlight the dissonance between these two realms of being. Your cosmic alignment suggests a need for balance, and unfortunately, that might mean making some changes to your external life—think friends, locations, etc.—before you can start to feel like yourself again.  No one gets it right one hundred percent of the time, not even you, Leo. A tense square between your ruling celestial body, the Sun, and a first-quarter Moon late in the week suggests tension between your philosophy and reality. It’s far easier to learn to be flexible with the universe’s ebb and flow than to try and have it bend to your will.  Luckily, you have some extra star power from a conjunction between Venus and Mercury lining up with the Sun. You don’t have to handle your problems in the dark. Don’t be afraid to talk it out, reach out to a trusted friend or family member, or do a bit of investing and experimenting. A change in mindset can be a challenge, but it’s certainly not impossible. Endings are scary but inevitable. The fear you associate with these changes doesn’t mean you’re making a mistake or should continue to suffer in this current state just to avoid the temporary pain of moving on. Entering the unknown will inevitably stir up a few butterflies in your stomach. What’s important is that you keep moving past these feelings.  Trust your instincts this week. As difficult as this process might feel, someone as pragmatic as you has likely known the changes you needed to make for weeks. It’s time to rip off the bandaid and get the tough part over with so you can start the more important healing process. The sooner you start, the sooner you can move on, Virgo.  In a perfect world, the fairest and most just outcomes would consistently prevail. But as you’re well aware, a perfect world this is not, and sometimes we have no other option but to accept the least favorable solution to a problem. The stars indicate that the current position you find yourself in is leaning toward the latter reality. Rather than exhausting yourself trying to bend this situation into something more palatable, the cosmos urge you to focus on remaining flexible. The limber sapling survives a storm, not the rigid oak. The universe has a way of balancing itself out. The negative you’re forced to reconcile with now will be counteracted by positivity further down the road.  Your star sign and ruling celestial body, Pluto, faces two significant oppositions this week. The one that will likely be the most tangible is a direct face-off between Haumea retrograde and Mars under your star sign and Taurus. During this time, prioritizing your needs and wants over external pursuits may be more challenging than usual.  Meanwhile, Pluto and a waxing crescent Moon oppose one another in the 5th House of Pleasure and 11th House of Friendships. This cosmic alignment indicates a need to reassess your relationships, hobbies, and passions. Do they still serve you positively? Do they make you as happy as they did when they first started? If not, perhaps it’s time to make some changes.  This week, communication is the name of the game, Sag. Whether it concerns finances or a close relationship, it will be absolutely critical to speak clearly and not leave room for misinterpretation. Ask questions, get all the details you can, and then make your decision. Acting in haste will open the door to errors, missteps, and regrets.  Fortunately, this shouldn’t be a problem, as you’re typically an excellent communicator. However, you might need to help those around you in this endeavor. Be patient as you go through this process. It might seem like a lot of grief right now, but it will benefit you in the long run when those around you learn how to communicate better, too.  It’s time to stop ignoring your subconscious feelings and bring them to the surface, Cap. Time has proven that pretending the problems aren’t there won’t make them go away. The longer you put off this effort, the more entangled and confusing this problem will become. All cosmic signs point to an urgent need to face this obstacle head-on.  A peak in the tension is most likely to occur when your ruling planet, Saturn, directly opposes a first-quarter Moon toward the end of the week. While it will be difficult, try to keep a level head through the conflict. Getting flustered won’t help you sort through the multiple layers of this issue. Don’t get hung up on the difficulty of it all—focus on the growth potential. One day of tough times can reveal far more about a relationship than years of smooth sailing. Turmoil may not be the most desirable option, but in certain scenarios, these challenges can be a cosmic blessing. Pay attention to those around you while you make your way through this obstacle. Are they helping or hurting your progress forward?  Listen to your internal emotional signals and, even more importantly, believe someone when they reveal who they truly are to you. Fairweather friends can be good company, but the people you can trust to stick by your side in the worst storms are the people worth keeping around. Allow this week’s hurdles to reveal who’s who in your life.  Habits are often seen as individual, personal phenomena, but these recurring patterns can form in interpersonal relationships, too. A standoff between your ruling planet, Neptune, and a first-quarter Moon at the end of the week will signal you to some shared tendencies that could be adjusted or dropped altogether.  If the relationship can’t survive without these habits that no longer serve you, then that might be a sign that the entire connection is faulty. For both of your growth journeys, the cosmos urges you to leave behind bonds that keep you rooted in the same place. Stagnancy might be comforting, but it can also quickly breed contempt. "
6,"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper",Thousands of Suspected Gang Members Moved to El Salvador’s ‘Mega Prison’,https://www.vice.com/en/article/3akwpj/thousands-of-suspected-gang-members-moved-to-el-salvadors-mega-prison,President Bukele’s anti-gang state of emergency has entered its second year.,2024-06-13T18:07:56Z,"El Salvador’s press office recently released a video showing the transfer of over 2,000 suspected gang members to a maximum-security prison. The inmates, who were accused of alleged involvement in gangs in El Salvador, were moved to the CECOT mega-prison (the Spanish acronym for the Counter-Terrorism Confinement Center) in Tecoluca. The country has been under an anti-gang emergency decree for over two years. The original state of emergency began in March of 2022 after a major spike in gang violence, which left 62 individuals dead in just one day.  As of April 2024, nearly 80,000 people have been arrested for presumed gang affiliations. According to many rights groups, these sweeps have been arbitrary, with suspects arrested due to location and appearance alone. In fact, many have been released due to a lack of evidence. Their conditions in prison have been heavily criticized, with one group claiming that dozens of inmates have died in prison as a result of torture. Since President Nayib Bukele began his crackdown on gang activity, El Salvador reportedly has a homicide rate of only 2.4 per 100,000 people—an extreme decline from 8 years ago, when it was 103 per 100,000. Today, El Salvador has the lowest homicide rate in Latin America, with a rate notably lower than the United States. As the transports of the inmates began over a year ago, Gustavo Villatoro, the government’s minister for justice and peace, stated that the arrested suspects “are never going to return to the communities, the neighborhoods, the barrios, the cities of our beloved El Salvador.” In the new video, the inmates were cuffed at their hands and feet, wearing nothing but white cotton shorts as authorities loaded them onto buses to transfer them to the new mega-prison. Many are concerned about the risk of human rights violations there. According to a recent report by Amnesty International, “Among the gravest consequences [of the anti-gang policy] are deaths in state custody. Many others are the result of inhumane conditions of imprisonment or denial of medical care and medicine.”"

He had been living with his mother in the Bronx, but then she got very sick and there wasn’t anything anyone could do. He stayed in her empty house eating orange sherbet directly out of the plastic tub, pouring orange soda from a two-litre bottle into the scooped-out divots till it all turned to slush. He’d do this all night: days and weeks doing just this, all alone. Sometimes he’d have a girl come over and they’d do lines of cocaine together off the black plastic top of a DVD player. Sometimes he’d watch the Yankees. Mostly he’d play internet billiards with strangers. This is the immobilising power of sadness, the purple-black tidal wave, the poisonous squid dragging you by your tendons to the darkest bottom of the ocean. The bar in question. Photo: Author's own When the money ran out he moved into a low-income housing complex in town and that’s how he found the bar. He didn’t have a car, he walked everywhere, miles and miles if he had to, and by the time he made it into work his cheeks and forehead would be lit-up red by the sting of winter air. He’d make fried plantain chips and a chicken parmesan that was so good you’d want to close your eyes. He’d play Dean Martin songs in the kitchen through his cellphone as it sat in an empty can of bread crumbs to amplify the sound while he hosed off the dishes. Sometimes he’d sing along so loud that the people sitting at the bar could hear him, and they’d say, What the hell is that, but they would all sort of be singing along too. Grimy men with stretched red faces; round lunatics in oil-spotted shirts; men with powdery patches of psoriasis on their elbows; men who smelled like mint and cigarettes every time of day; men with serious problems and malaises who just couldn’t help it when it came to anything, pummelled by decades of grand and minor scale calamity. But now here was an interlude and there was an amazing kind of life in their eyes. Tommy would rumble out of the kitchen in his busted sneakers, with the rubber soles peeling and dangling askew off the bottom like the tongues of old horses, and he’d slap his meaty palms on the bar again and again and again, his mouth wide open as they all roar the “ohhh, ohhh, OHHH” part in “Volare”, and tonight he is home again, he is home like he was born in this room, like all his ancestors were born here going back to the prehistoric times and they were seated before him now, the outside world a barren, frozen planet but here inside a fire 10 feet high. Here, he was a man of great renown, a man with solutions, and now the people at the bar were thinking they might stay a little longer. Those were good times. You’d have to say that all that booze had something to do with it.  But there was something else going on in there too, a kind of silent agreement – with each other, with the bar itself and with good God above, that all of your memories, your lusts, your victories and your most divine bullshit could play in here like the truth. Your tragedies were real tragedies and your miracles were real miracles, and no one could say otherwise. Here, you were free from interrogation, speculation; you were spreading your towel out in some distant oasis whenever you wanted. There was a guy who came in once who worked construction; he was tan, muscular but his torso was hunched and constricted and bent in odd directions. He was holding a bottle of Budweiser. He told me that in the summer when he was younger him and this girl would go down to the marina at night to get drunk in random boats, bobbing there in the dark in this sort of open-air hotel room they’d hijacked for themselves, and when he said sometimes they'd fuck in those boats too his voice took off and he clapped his hands so hard a cloud of sheetrock dust flew off him. Sunset from the backdoor of the bar. Photo: Author's own There was another man who would come in to use our cordless phone. He’d go behind the building to make calls, out on the concrete steps that led down to the dumpsters and below that to a hideous-looking river that storks with stained feathers would creep along the shores of. I imagined that these were vacations for him, a beach carved out of 15 minutes, the tiny mercies in an otherwise grey march to wherever he was going. When it was warm sometimes we’d have a beer back there and there was a generator that hummed loud enough that we didn’t feel strange just standing there not talking. These were not quite travellers, but they were always sort of preparing for something. There was always a discussion about going somewhere, coming from somewhere, a friend at some other bar, a call they were waiting on, some big news that had just come across the wire, and whoever was in here half-watching the limp and lazy middle-innings of a Wednesday afternoon baseball game was going to make it real and juicy by listening to you talk about it. A girl they knew in Costa Rica; a guy they knew who just bought a jet ski; a picture their friend had just texted them of Keith Hernandez at a casino steakhouse. They had a certain dignity. They didn’t go places for leisure or indulgence, they ended up there for work, or the Marines. Somewhere they followed a girlfriend to, somewhere in Pennsylvania or Tennessee, seven years working for her dad’s roofing company, which they would share not with shame or bitterness but a voice of triumph and love in their hearts, something that came from them and is of them, a proof of a life at all. They were out there threading the remnants of one day to the rumours of glory that may wait in all the rest of them, one after another, and that alone was a testimony, evidence of a tremendously powerful spirit. I had never been to Tennessee but this was my postcard, received in real time. There was a guy who told me he once took a shit in a port-a-potty in the middle of an Aerosmith concert in New Jersey. Imagine that? Tommy. Photo: Author's own On Saturday afternoons there was a group that would come in to drink beer and play music on the jukebox, we called it the matinee. They’d eat our stale tortilla chips and salsa we poured from a gallon jug into little plastic cups. Someone would play that Stevie Nicks song with Don Henley. It was early enough that this horrible old bar still had the smell of chemicals from the cleaning crew that came in overnight, and for these moments it was a Fresh bar, a disinfected bar. We’d watch out the front window as cars tried to parallel park, lurching and coming to sudden angled halts as traffic whipped by, some panicked face in the driver’s seat trying to figure it all out. Someone was talking about DIY methods to get rid of the flies that were laying eggs in his shower drain. Someone was talking about the absurd and let’s face it irresistible melodrama of Don Henley’s voice. Someone was talking about how far a drive it was to Wisconsin, what was Wisconsin like, and he would say that it was beautiful there, that he drove there once with his ex-boyfriend, and then that would be what I said whenever I met anyone who mentioned Wisconsin. I would say, I heard it’s beautiful there, in a tone like that was a surprising detail, my valuable dispatch to share from a foreign land. And then two years ago I was in Wisconsin for a wedding, at a vineyard that was on the other side of a gentle sloping hill, and my girlfriend was wandering through the rows of grapes as the sky was turning this diluted shade of Vitamin Water pink. It was October and it was late but no one was wearing jackets. In every picture she is uncoiled and warm looking, putting on a show, smiling crazy—it can be like that in October, even in Wisconsin, which you maybe wouldn’t think—and in the rows of grapes I thought about Saturday afternoons, drunk with my brothers. I thought, it’s beautiful there, it’s true what they say. @RBUAS"

On paper, this kicked off the “Monday Night Wars,” that period of the late 1990s when pro wrestling became a television juggernaut. But things didn’t really heat up until May of the following year.  In 1996, Turner Entertainment Network president Brad Siegel had the idea of extending Nitro from one hour to two. This would give the show a leg up over Raw, which was still only one hour at the time. Plus, the network could sell more advertising and thus increase overall revenue.  For Nitro’s executive producer and announcer, Eric Bischoff, the prospect of expansion was daunting. A two-hour show would strain the company creatively, and they’d need more talent. And the debut two-hour edition of Nitro would need to be big—done correctly, it could kickstart the new era and draw both attention and excitement to the updated product.  Luckily for Bischoff, the chips were falling in his favor. Four-time Intercontinental Champion and one of the most popular performers on the WWF roster, Scott Hall, recently had his WWF contract expire. The Bad Guy was now WCW-bound.  While Hall had found success in the WWF as Razor Ramon, he was never positioned as the “top guy” in the company. The opportunity to reach a new level of stardom in WCW—and to make more (guaranteed) money while working fewer dates—was simply too good to pass up.  Hall’s WCW debut went down on May 27, 1996, in what is now one of the most celebrated segments in Nitro history. It provided the exact big bang moment Bischoff needed to send Nitro skyrocketing into the pro wrestling stratosphere.  Because WWF owned the rights to the Razor Ramon name, WCW had faced a daunting task: coming up with a fresh monicker for their newest superstar. They decided to keep it simple. He’d have no ring name, just going by Scott Hall eventually—a move that would only add to his effortlessly cool persona.  And instead of airing weeks of fancy video packages hyping Hall’s debut, or having him appear in a one-sided squash match, WCW did something different. They had Hall walk to the ring through the crowd, unannounced, with no entrance music, in the middle of a match that didn’t even involve him.  While the awestruck commentators acknowledged his presence—as did the wrestlers in the ring—they didn’t call him by any name, building the intrigue around him to previously impossible heights. Hall grabbed a microphone, sauntered into the ring, and with a smirk, delivered the iconic line: “You know who I am… but you don’t know why I’m here.”  The concept of Hall’s first storyline was that he was “invading” WCW from the WWF. Not using his name, playing entrance music for him, or even having him wrestle in a match on that first night were strokes of creative genius. It was a simple, well-executed concept that pro wrestling companies have tried to replicate for years without the same level of success.  It’s also worth mentioning that all of this was happening while the internet was still in its infancy. Without the spoiler-ridden “dirt sheets” of today, Hall’s WCW debut was a surprise to fans, giving an already massive moment an even greater impact.  A few weeks later, Hall’s partner in crime at the WWF, Kevin Nash, also jumped ship to WCW. The duo, dubbed “The Outsiders,” began a “hostile takeover” storyline that provided the centerpiece around which the entire Nitro show revolved. What followed in the next few months was not only a high point for WCW creatively but also the start of the 1990s “wrestling boom.”  After weeks of teasing a “third man,” the trio was finally completed in July. Jaws all across the country dropped as “The Immortal” Hulk Hogan revealed himself as a founding member of professional wrestling’s newest phenomenon, the New World Order (nWo). Hogan had been in WCW for a few years and was doing his traditional “Hulkamania” character. Rather than the standing ovations of years past, however, Hogan’s Marty Stu persona had begun to draw boos from a mid-90s audience who craved an edge to their idols.  Though it risked decades of work honing his image as a shining hero, Hogan took the plunge, reinventing himself as a “bad guy” and changing the trajectory of WCW forever.  Together, Hall, Nash, and Hogan would run roughshod over WCW—both on-screen and behind the scenes—for the next few years. Hogan’s creative control clause in his contract gave him the power to ensure that he, and the nWo, were always near the top of the card. Sadly, the nWo’s seemingly limitless popularity would eventually sour as the group overstayed its welcome, stifling WCW’s creative plans entirely by the middle of 1998.  Before the nWo—and WCW as a whole—began its downward spiral, however, Hall, Nash, and Hogan set the standard for main event entertainment. From Sting’s rise to WCW’s savior from the nWo in 1997 to Goldberg’s legendary championship win over Hogan in 1998, the group was a key figure in many of the company’s greatest moments.  The nWo’s success was so great that it transcended WCW, forcing the WWF to change course as well. Formerly colorful and cartoony storylines morphed into a gritty, risqué product, with stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock hauling the WWF past WCW in every important metric by 1999.  The nWo would disband for good in 2000 and, less than a year later, WCW shut its doors entirely. Many would argue that the main stars of the nWo—including Scott Hall—played a major role in the company’s eventual demise. The trio seemed far too focused on what was best for them, and not for the company overall, which didn’t help things when it came to WCW’s survival.  However, it’s impossible to deny that Hall’s debut set in motion the events that would become the biggest boom period in the history of professional wrestling.

9,"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper",Why Did America Abandon Route 66?,https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3m7y9/route-66-road-trip-abandoned,A road trip down its iconic path to the West Coast to see what’s left.,2024-06-14T18:59:08Z,"Established in 1926, Route 66 was a highway that connected Chicago to Los Angeles, spanning nearly 2,500 miles across eight states. Once known as “the Mother Road,” its iconic path to the coast was eventually replaced by newer highways, and it was officially decommissioned in the 1980s.  Still, portions of the original Route 66 exist today, hanging onto that old spirit of the open road. In 2016, for VICE TV’s Abandoned, skateboarders Rick McCrank and Frank Gerwer road-tripped it as best as they could, starting in California and stopping in each state Route 66 passed through.  “We’re gonna start this story at the end,” Rick said. “The end of the road”—California’s Santa Monica Pier.  Before heading out, he spoke with Ian Bowen, owner of a Route 66 gift shop on the pier.  “[Route 66] is the part of old-fashioned America that should be preserved,” Bowen said. “The culture, the conversation, the way people care. The way the old road was built, it went right through the main street of every town. It’s why it’s known as the ‘Main Street of America.’” In the 1950s, new interstates offered quicker travel, with few exits connecting to Route 66. As major highways began to attract all the traffic, Mother Road lost most of its business. And though Route 66 was was included in the National Register of Historic Places after it was decommissioned, as Rick and Frank learned, some of the route’s historic attractions aren’t so, well, attractive.  In Arizona, the Apache Skate Crew showed the duo their least favorite roadside stops in the ghost town of Twin Arrows. “Route 66 just cut right through the middle of the Navajo Reservation up here in northern Arizona,” said Apache Skateboards’s Douglas Miles.  He pointed out several landmarks in the area. “There’s a bunch of cheesy, stereotypical, weird, semi-racist-looking kind of structures here now,” he said. “That’s why these places are falling apart too, in a way, because I think people over time realized this place is whack."" “I’m embarrassed what the American people who came here have done to the Native Americans,” Frank admitted. “I felt embarrassed for the white man, basically, for fucking blowing it for all those years … I felt guilty.” The Apache Skate Crew thanked the two for their acknowledgment of the issue and willingness to call it out. “Not a lot of people would have the guts to say that,” Douglas said. “We respect that.” As Rick and Frank continued down the Mother Road, they found some lingering signs of life—including one of the lat remaining motels on a stretch in New Mexico. Built in 1939, the Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari was still well-maintained and bustling with guests during the summer months. “We have people almost banging down the door [during the summer],” said Cameron Mueller, motel manager. “We have people from all over the world.” “Route 66 is definitely thriving in some ways,” he continued. “There’s a lot of people who want to experience what America was like before cellphones and tablets and computers. They want to see Americana. They don’t want to just look at it on a computer screen. This is the best way to do it: a trip down the Mother Road.” While certain parts of Route 66 were still alive and semi-well, others were completely abandoned. Take Texola, Oklahoma, for instance. Located right near the border of Texas along Mother Road, the ghost town boasted a population of just 43 people in 2020. The only sort of movement in the area was a lone tumbleweed, and even that was slow-moving. “I guess that’s the mark of a good road trip: it ends before you want it to.” Speaking of tumbleweed, the only business in Texola was called Tumbleweed Grill, which was then temporarily closed. Masel Zimmerman, the restaurant’s owner, said she was attempting to maintain the town by purchasing any properties that were for sale and fixing them up.  However, despite her attempt to revive the once-bustling town, she said, “The way that it was, it will never be like that again. Not here in this town. It will never be like that again.” With access to far more convenient interstates today, not many people travel the Main Street of America anymore. However, those who do can enjoy a slower alternative to living—and countless historical attractions, abandoned yet charming towns, and loyal communities.  By the time Rick and Frank reached the end—or, really, the beginning—of Route 66 in Chicago, Illinois, they reflected on their travels with a newfound appreciation. “I guess that’s the mark of a good road trip: it ends before you want it to,” Rick said. “Because even when you’re driving down a dead highway full of ghost towns, rotten tourist traps, and tumbleweeds, even when you realize the nostalgia is bull—, there’s nothing like taking it slow with an old friend.”"

He might have fucking 11,” says pro skater Elijah Berle, “because it’s insane some of these stories I hear.""",2024-06-10T14:37:40Z,"Anthony Van Engelen is a skateboarding legend, renowned for an aggressive skating style that’s as intense as his personality. “When everybody’s grinding three feet, he’s grinding like 12 feet,” says videographer Aaron Meza. “He’s super powerful.”  His commitment to nailing big tricks meant he also became known for his epic meltdowns, captured in a series of iconic video appearances where he’s shown taking his frustrations out on his board. “It’s scary when [he] freaks out—you’re like, ‘Holy shit, he could probably just murder anybody’,” said the late pro skater Dylan Rieder, in an old interview. “He’s got that like intensity, it shows when he skates. That’s why he looks so awesome on a skateboard.” On the latest episode of Epicly Later'd, VICE speaks to the man known as AVE and his skating peers about his legendary career, and how his natural talents long threatened to be overshadowed by substance abuse. “Cats have nine lives. He might have fucking 11,” says pro skater Elijah Berle. “Because it’s insane some of these stories I hear… him using drugs and partying and not sleeping for three days and going to film tricks after.” Like most kids growing up in Southern California, Van Engelen got into skateboarding at an early age. But while he displayed a natural talent, even by his mid-teens his appetite for partying was already threatening to derail his burgeoning career. “By the time I was like 15, 16, I kind of started getting into partying and stuff, and wasn’t skating as much,” says Van Engelen, who is now 45. Over the next couple of years he drifted—missing school, partying too much and skating too little—until his life took an unexpected turn. His stepfather had moved to St Petersburg, Russia, to open a restaurant, and he gave Van Engelen an ultimatum in a bid to get his life on track. “He was like, ‘You’ve either got to go to school, get a job, or you can come over here.’ I thought about it and I was like, ‘Fuck it, I’ll go over there,’” he says. “It was insane. As soon as I got there, I was like, ‘Oh my god, this was a mistake’.” Van Engelen lasted just four months of a planned year in the chaotic post-Soviet St Petersburg of the mid-90s before returning home. But still, the break from his comfortable life in California proved to be just what he needed, and he returned to skating with a newfound passion. “I was grateful that I went there and had switched some gears in my head,” he says. “Because for a kid coming from Southern California, partying and skateboarding and whatever the fuck I was doing, it was a wake up call—life’s a lot different outside my reality. I had changed in that short amount of time,” he says. “I kind of re-fell in love with … skating.” Before long, Van Engelen crossed paths with Jason Dill, a pro skater a couple of years older than him, who noticed his obvious talent and took him under his wing. Soon Van Engelen was making a big name for himself as a professional. But the hard-partying lifestyle of a professional skateboarder repeatedly threatened to derail his career. “Anthony was terrible at drinking,” says Dill. “I still have a chipped bone … in this elbow because he tackled me on Sunset Boulevard.” And it wasn’t just alcohol, explains Dill, who shared his close friend and collaborator’s appetite for drugs before eventually cleaning up. “I couldn’t smoke crack with Anthony the way I could smoke crack with other friends,” he says. “It wasn’t fun … when I did it with Anthony. He just got too gnarly… It was dark.” Van Engelen realised he was squandering his talent, but his various attempts to clean up his act didn’t take. He recalls a trip he took to stay with fellow pro skater Anthony Pappalardo at his apartment in Barcelona, Spain, with the intention to knuckle down, focus on his skating and “get my shit together.” “I was fucked up and went there and… that was bad,” he says. Pappalardo—who had set up a room for Van Engelen to stay in, looking forward to a period of skating intensely together—recalls his disappointment when he showed up without his skateboard, and showed no sign of easing off his hard-partying ways. “On maybe the third day I saw him come out [of his room], he had like a leather jacket on, nothing underneath, like a rock star … just going to get dinner,” says Pappalardo. “I was trying to talk to him being like, ‘You want to maybe skate this trip or something?’” Van Engelen recalls with embarrassment his reaction to Pappalardo, who was drinking a glass of wine with a book by Charles Bukowski at his side. “I’m like, ‘You read about it, I live it,’ and I fucking left,” says Van Engelen. Pappalardo says the pair laughed years later about how much the trip had cost—more than $20,000 on flights and partying. “He didn’t step on a board once. It was kind of a bummer,” says Pappalardo. “I was looking forward to skating with him.” It would be years—involving failed attempts at rehab and interventions from friends—before Van Engelen would find sobriety, get fit, and fulfil his potential as a skater.  “Enough things weren’t working,” he says. “I kind of had a moment of clarity. It was just a realization of just: ‘Fuck man, I just need some fucking help. I’m not capable of running this show with or without alcohol and drugs.’” Now he’s been sober for a third of his life and remains an active professional skater, continuing to command the respect of younger generations, even into his mid 40s. In 2015, he was named skateboarding bible Thrasher magazine’s skater of the year.  “To me, Anthony is a hero,” said pro skater Donovon Piscopo. “He’s not just a skateboard legend, he’s a legend in just being a fucking human being.”"
