         Sacramento, Calif. — Proposed rules to protect California workers from extreme heat would extend to schoolchildren, requiring school districts to find ways to keep classrooms cool. If the standards are approved this month, employers in the nation's most populous state will have to provide relief to indoor workers in sweltering warehouses, steamy kitchens and other dangerously hot job sites. The rules will extend to schools, where teachers, custodians, cafeteria workers and other employees may work without air conditioning — like their students. ""Our working conditions are students' learning conditions,"" said Jeffery Freitas, president of the California Federation of Teachers, which represents more than 120,000 teachers and other educational employees. ""We're seeing an unprecedented change in the environment, and we know for a fact that when it's too hot, kids can't learn."" A state worker safety board is scheduled to vote on the rules June 20, and they would likely take effect this summer. The move, which marks Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's latest effort to respond to the growing impacts of climate change and extreme heat, would put California ahead of the federal government and much of the nation in setting heat standards. The standards would require indoor workplaces to be cooled below 87 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present and below 82 degrees in places where workers wear protective clothing or are exposed to radiant heat, such as furnaces. Schools and other worksites that don't have air conditioning could use fans, misters, and other methods to bring the room temperature down. The rules allow workarounds for businesses, including the roughly 1,000 school districts in the state, if they can't cool their workplaces sufficiently. In those cases, employers must provide workers with water, breaks, areas where they can cool down, cooling vests or other means to keep employees from overheating. ""Heat is a deadly hazard no matter what kind of work you do,"" said Laura Stock, a member of the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board. ""If you have an indoor space that is both populated by workers and the public, or in this case by children, you would have the same risks to their health as to workers."" Heat waves have historically struck outside of the school year, but climate change is making them longer, more frequent and more intense. Last year was the hottest on record and schools across the U.S. closed sporadically during spring and summer, unable to keep students cool. Scientists say this year could be even hotter. School officials in Vicksburg, Mississippi, last month ended the school year early when air conditioners had issues. And California's first heat wave of the season is hitting while some schools are still in session, with temperatures reaching 105 in the Central Valley. Several states, including Arizona and New Mexico, require schools to have working air conditioners, but they aren't required to run them. Mississippi requires schools to be air-conditioned but doesn't say to what temperature. Hawaii schools must have classrooms at a ""temperature acceptable for student learning,"" without specifying the temperature. And Oregon schools must try to cool classrooms, such as with fans, and provide teachers and other employees ways to cool down, including water and rest breaks, when the heat index indoors reaches 80 degrees. When the sun bakes the library at Bridges Academy at Melrose, a public school in East Oakland with little shade and tree cover, Christine Schooley closes the curtains and turns off the computers to cool her room. She stopped using a fan after a girl's long hair got caught in it. ""My library is the hottest place on campus because I have 120 kids through here a day,"" Schooley said. ""It stays warm in here. So yeah, it makes me grouchy and irritable as well."" A 2021 analysis by the Center for Climate Integrity suggests nearly 14,000 public schools across the U.S. that did not need air conditioning in 1970 now do, because they annually experience 32 days of temperatures more than 80 degrees — upgrades that would cost more than $40 billion. Researchers found that same comparison produces a cost of $2.4 billion to install air conditioning in 678 California schools. It's not clear how many California schools might need to install air conditioners or other cooling equipment to comply with the new standards because the state doesn't track which ones already have them, said V. Kelly Turner, associate director of the Luskin Center for Innovation at the University of California-Los Angeles. And a school district in the northern reaches of the state would not face the same challenges as a district in the desert cities of Needles or Palm Springs, said Naj Alikhan, a spokesperson for the Association of California School Administrators, which has not taken a position on the proposed rules. An economic analysis commissioned for the board provided cost estimates for a host of industries — such as warehousing, manufacturing, and construction — but lacked an estimate for school districts, which make up one of the largest public infrastructure systems in the state and already face a steep backlog of needed upgrades. The state Department of Education hasn't taken a position on the proposal and a spokesperson, Scott Roark, declined to comment on the potential cost to schools. Projections of a multibillion-dollar cost to state prisons were the reason the Newsom administration refused to sign off on the indoor heat rules this year. Since then, tens of thousands of prison and jail employees — and prisoners — have been exempted. It's also unclear whether the regulation will apply to school buses, many of which don't have air conditioning. The Department of Industrial Relations, which oversees the worker safety board, has not responded to queries from school officials or KFF Health News. Libia Garcia worries about her 15-year-old son, who spends at least an hour each school day traveling on a hot, stuffy school bus from their home in the rural Central Valley community of Huron to his high school and back. ""Once my kid arrives home, he is exhausted; he is dehydrated,"" Garcia said in Spanish. ""He has no energy to do homework or anything else."" The California Federation of Teachers is pushing state lawmakers to pass a climate-resilient schools bill that would require the state to develop a master plan to upgrade school heating and air conditioning systems. Newsom last year vetoed similar legislation, citing the cost. Campaigns to cool schools in other states have yielded mixed results. Legislation in Colorado and New Hampshire failed this year while bills in New Jersey and New York were pending as of June 6. Last month, a teachers union in New York brought a portable sauna to the state Capitol to demonstrate how hot it can get inside classrooms, only a quarter of which have air conditioning, said Melinda Person, president of New York State United Teachers. ""We have these temperature limits for animal shelters. How is it that we don't have it for classrooms?"" said Democratic New York Assembly member Chris Eachus, whose bill would require schools to take relief measures when classrooms and buildings reach 82 degrees. ""We do have to protect the health and safety of the kids."" Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S. — deadlier than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. Heat stress can cause heatstroke, cardiac arrest and kidney failure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,600 heat-related deaths occurred in 2021, which is likely an undercount because health care providers are not required to report them. It's not clear how many of these deaths are related to work, either indoors or outdoors. California has had heat standards on the books for outdoor workers since 2005, and rules for indoor workplaces have been in development since 2016 — delayed, in part, because of the covid pandemic. At the federal level, the Biden administration has been slow to release a long-awaited regulation to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat exposure. Although an official said a draft is expected this year, its outlook could hinge on the November presidential election. If former President Donald Trump wins, it is unlikely that rules targeting businesses will move forward. The Biden White House held a summit on school sustainability and climate change in April, at which top officials encouraged districts to apply an infusion of new federal dollars to upgrade their aging infrastructure. The administration also unveiled an 18-page guide for school districts to tap federal funds. ""How we invest in our school buildings and our school grounds, it makes a difference for our students' lives,"" Roberto Rodriguez, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, said at the summit. ""They are on the front line in terms of feeling those impacts.""

         President Biden on Friday drew on the heroism of the U.S. Army Rangers who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc on D-Day in 1944, urging Americans to think of their nation's cause as greater than themselves and cautioning against isolationism.  The president spoke against the backdrop of the cliff, a heavily fortified German position captured by the Rangers during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. Mr. Biden drew a connection between the Allied powers' fight for freedom 80 years ago and supporting Ukraine amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.  ""Does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against Putin's aggression here in Europe today?"" Mr. Biden asked his audience. ""They stormed the beaches alongside their allies. Does anyone believe these Rangers would want America to go it alone today? They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the '30s and '40s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn't move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?""  Warning against isolationism and emphasizing the cost of not standing up to dictators has been a recurring theme this week for Mr. Biden. He's in France to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the massive seaborne invasion that put the allies on the road to ending World War II.  ""When we talk about democracy, American democracy, we often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,"" Mr. Biden said Friday. ""What we don't talk about is how hard it is. How many ways we're asked to walk away, how many instincts are to walk away. The most natural instinct is to walk away — to be selfish, to force our will upon others, to seize power, never give it up. American democracy asks the hardest of things — to believe that we're a part of something bigger than ourselves. ""So democracy begins with each of us, begins when one person decides there's something more important than themselves,"" the president continued. ""When they decide the person they're serving alongside of is someone to look after. When they decide the mission matters more than their life. When they decide that their country matters more than they do. That's what the Rangers at Point du Hoc did. That's what they decided. That's what every soldier, every Marine who stormed these beaches decided."" During the U.S. assault on the Omaha and Utah beaches on D-Day, U.S. Army Rangers scaled 100-foot cliffs and seized German artillery that could have targeted American troops as they landed. The operation's success came at a high cost — out of the 225 Rangers deployed on the mission, fewer than 75 were still in fighting condition by its end — but the assault resulted in a successful defense against Germany's counterattacks. ""All they could hear was the crack of bullets hitting ships, sand, rocks, hitting everything,"" Mr. Biden said. ""All they knew was time was of the essence. They had only 30 minutes, 30 minutes to eliminate the Nazi guns high on this cliff, guns that could halt the allied invasion before it even began.""  The World War II Pointe du Hoc Ranger Monument was built to honor those men.  ""The Rangers who scaled this cliff didn't know they would change the world, but they did. I've long said that history has shown that ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things when challenged,"" Mr. Biden said. ""There's no better example of that in the entire world than right here at Pointe du Hoc. ... They came to a shoreline that none of them would have picked out on a map. They came to a country many of them had never seen, for a people they had never met. But they came. They did their job. They fulfilled their mission, and they did their duty. ""I stand here today as the first president to come to Pointe du Hoc when none of those 225 brave men who scaled this cliff on D-Day are still alive, none,"" Mr. Biden continued. ""But I am here to tell you that with them gone, the wind we hear coming off this ocean will not fade. It will grow louder. As we gather here today, it's not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery on that day, June 6, 1944. It's to listen to the echoes of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us. And they're summoning us now. They ask us, what will we do? They're not asking us to scale these cliffs. But they're asking us to stay true to what America stands for."" Ukraine has been a key focus for Mr. Biden, both in his speech and as he meets with world leaders in France.  ""The price of unchecked tyranny is the blood of the young and the brave,"" Mr. Biden said in a speech at Normandy on Thursday. ""In their generation, in their hour of trial, the Allied forces of D-Day did their duty. Now the question for us is, in our hour of trial, will we do ours?"" Mr. Biden met Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was at Omaha Beach for an international event commemorating D-Day. ""The unity that defines history,"" Zelenskyy tweeted Thursday. ""Today in France, alongside our allies, we honored the bravery of the Allied forces who landed in Normandy 80 years ago. We remember. We thank them. We uphold the values of the defenders of life."" As they met Friday, Mr. Biden issued his first public apology to the Ukrainian people for the months of uncertainty over whether $61 billion in additional U.S. assistance for Ukraine's war effort would actually come. That aid was held up by conservative Republican members of Congress attaching domestic border issues to the foreign assistance package, which finally passed at the end of April and was quickly signed by Mr. Biden. The U.S. president also announced a new $225 million assistance package for Ukraine, which the State Department said in a statement would including ""urgently needed weapons and equipment"" to help Zelenskyy's forces repel Russia's offensive around the northeast Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.  The State Department said the package would include ""air defense interceptors, artillery systems and munitions, armored vehicles, anti-tank weapons, and other capabilities.""  ""We will move this new assistance as quickly as possible to bolster Ukraine's defense of its territory and its people,"" the State Department said. Mr. Biden assured Zelenskyy that the American people were committed to standing with Ukraine in the face of Russia's aggression for the long haul, telling him: ""We're still in. Completely. Thoroughly.""  ""It's very important that in this unity, United States of America, all American people stay with Ukraine like it was during World War II,"" Zelenskyy told the U.S. leader. ""How the United States helped to save human lives, to save Europe. And we count on your continuing support in standing with us, shoulder to shoulder."" Mr. Biden was expected to discuss the future of support for Ukraine with French President Emmanuel Macron later during his state visit to France.  Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.

         Hunter Biden's defense team called Naomi Biden, his daughter with ex-wife Kathleen Buhle, to testify Friday at his trial on charges related to his October 2018 purchase of a firearm. Much of the questioning focused on a trip Hunter Biden took to New York to exchange cars with his daughter, who had borrowed his truck for a few days during the window of time in October that Hunter Biden was in possession of the gun. Over the weekend or on Monday morning, Hunter Biden's lawyers will reveal whether he'll take the stand in his own defense. President Biden's brother, James ""Jimmy"" Biden was expected to testify Friday, but the court adjourned earlier than expected. If Hunter Biden testifies, prosecutors indicated they may call an additional witness.  Hunter Biden's lawyers asked Naomi Biden about her interactions with her father in August and October 2018. Naomi Biden, who is also a lawyer, testified about seeing her father in Los Angeles in August 2018, after not having seen him for an extended period of time. She said she and her boyfriend Peter Neal, who is now her husband, drove from Wyoming to see her father while he was in rehab for drug addiction. They met at the end of August in a coffee shop with his sober coach for lunch.  ""He seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died,"" she said. ""I told him that I was so proud of him and I was so proud to introduce Peter to him.""  She later described an interaction with him in mid-October 2018 in New York, when they exchanged Hunter Biden's truck for the Cadillac that belonged to her grandfather, Joe Biden, who was then the former vice president. Hallie Biden, who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden at the time, testified that she found the gun in his truck and discarded it on Oct. 23 — 11 days after he bought it. The messages exchanged between Naomi Biden and her father related to the car exchange in New York took place over three days, between Oct. 17-19, during the period when he had the gun in his possession. Naomi Biden and Neal had borrowed Hunter Biden's truck to help Neal move his belongings from Washington, D.C., so that he could join her in New York. Naomi Biden said the truck was in ""good condition,"" with no drug paraphernalia, and her father seemed great at that time.  But under cross-examination by prosecutor Leo Wise, Naomi Biden conceded, ""Yes, I knew that he was struggling with addiction,"" but said he never used illegal drugs in front of her. ""After my Uncle (Beau Biden) died, things got bad."" She acknowledged that she had never observed what her father looked like when he was using drugs.  Naomi Biden began speaking more and more softly as the cross-examination continued, but she maintained her composure, even when she was asked to review her text messages with her father from Oct. 18, 2018. Wise focused on this visit to try to establish that Hunter Biden was still an addict and the drug paraphernalia later found in the truck belonged to him. There were text messages coming from Hunter Biden late at night, and their schedules made it difficult for the two to meet, in part, Naomi Biden said later, because she had a law internship in Brooklyn. Wise read one text from Naomi Biden that said in part, ""I just want to hang out with you."" Hunter Biden allegedly replied with an apology for being unreachable. ""I'm sorry, I have been so unreachable, it's not fair to you,"" he wrote at about 10:30 p.m. on the evening of Oct. 18. Wise pressed her on whether she knew that at that time her father was meeting someone named Frankie (an alleged drug dealer) that night at his hotel and had given him access to his Wells Fargo account. She repeatedly replied, ""No.""  During these exchanges, at times Hunter Biden leaned forward on the defense table, his eyes on his daughter with his hand covering his mouth. The mood in the Biden family section where the first lady and other members of the Biden family were seated was notably tense during Naomi Biden's testimony.  When Naomi Biden was excused, she hugged her father and they exchanged a kiss on the cheek before she walked out. Once court adjourned for lunch, Hunter Biden reached for Jill Biden as he exited, taking her hand. She was walking slowly, letting go as he moved ahead.  Before Naomi Biden's testimony, Jason Turner, a former employee of StarQuest Shooters, and Ron Palmieri, the owner of the gun store, were the defense's first two witnesses. Turner testified about the gun sale and background check for Hunter Biden's gun purchase, and he acknowledged that he had added the supplemental ID information; it was shown in a court exhibit. Palmieri testified that he had approved the passport used as ID for the purchase and never interacted with Hunter Biden during the sale. The prosecution's last two witnesses Friday morning were a chemist for the FBI and a DEA agent.  Dr. Jason Brewer testified that he identified a ""minimal amount"" of cocaine from his analysis of the white residual powder on the leather pouch that was recovered with the gun. He said he wasn't authorized to test for fingerprints or the residue origins. During cross-examination by David Kolansky, the defense pointed to the timing of the forensic analysis — five years after its initial recovery by law enforcement. DEA supervisory agent Joshua Romig decoded some of the language in Hunter Biden's 2018-2019 text messages, in which he referenced ""baby powder,"" ""soft stuff"" and ""party favor."" Romig said all of these terms referenced some form of cocaine.  He testified on the origins, transport and distribution of cocaine and analyzed some of the drug paraphernalia, scales and measurements depicted in photos in Biden's text messages. During cross-examination, Hunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, again focused on timing, noting that texts and images referenced by the prosecution were exchanged before and after the October purchase of the firearm. Romig noted the exception of one October text in which Hunter Biden explicitly mentioned he was smoking crack cocaine. Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies stemming from his purchase of a revolver in October 2018. Two of the charges are related to accusations that he made false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use, certifying he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance during a period when prosecutors allege he was addicted to crack cocaine.  The other charge is for allegedly owning the gun unlawfully, possessing the gun for 11 days before Hallie Biden found and discarded the weapon. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Hallie Biden, who is also the widow of Beau Biden, Hunter Biden's brother, testified Thursday that she ""panicked"" when she found the gun, saying it was ""stupid"" but she was worried one of the children would find it.  She told the court she discovered it when she was clearing out his car, which she often searched for drugs and alcohol. Prosecutors introduced parking lot surveillance footage that showed her driving into a grocery store parking lot and tossing the gun into a dumpster, followed by another clip showing her returning to the store to search for the gun. While Hunter Biden's history of drug addiction is well known — he wrote about it in his memoir, ""Beautiful Things"" — Lowell has sought to raise questions about whether he knowingly omitted the information from the disclosure form. In his opening statement, Lowell said that many addicts are in ""denial"" about their drug use, and he also argued that Hunter Biden did not consider himself to be an addict when he purchased the gun. Prosecutors showed texts Thursday between Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden from Oct. 2018 — when he allegedly bought the gun — where Hunter Biden said he was ""buying,"" as well as another in which she said her son was sitting near a ""stem,"" or crack pipe, in her house.  Hallie Biden also told the court that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine during the time they were romantically involved.  ""It was a terrible experience that I went through and I'm embarrassed and ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,"" she said.  ABC News' David Muir asked President Biden in an interview on Thursday if he would rule out pardoning his son if he is convicted. Mr. Biden responded, ""Yes.""  Erica Brown covers investigative stories, often on politics, as a multiplatform reporter and producer at CBS News. She previously worked for BBC News and NBC News.

         Firefly fans who'd like to see lightning bugs year-round are out of luck.  The insect, which is a type of beetle, is usually seen only between spring and summer, with different species emerging at different times. The first fireflies of the season come out later in the year as you move farther north.  The fireflies people see glowing and flying around are adults, said Sara Lewis, author of ""Silent Sparks: The Wondrous World of Fireflies."" Their time aboveground before dying is brief, with fireflies actually spending the bulk of their lives living underground.  ""One of the very surprising things about fireflies is that the ones that we're used to seeing — the very charming, ethereal adults that are flying around in summertime — they have a backstory,"" Lewis said. ""They are really just the back end of a firefly life cycle."" During their brief time as adults, fireflies are focused on reproduction. Some are so focused on it that they don't even eat, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Most of the firefly species in the U.S. — there are around 170, according to Lewis — lay eggs in soil, moss or at the base of plants. They look for areas that are moist because the eggs are tiny, soft and dry out easily. It takes about two weeks for the firefly larvae to hatch.  ""If they dry out during that period, they're dead,"" Lewis said.  The eggs are about the size of a pinhead, according to Candace Fallon, senior conservation biologist at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, said. After the eggs hatch, the larvae burrow into the ground, where they spend the next one to two years, depending on the species. After the larvae stage, there's a brief stage as pupae before the adults emerge. Though juvenile fireflies glow, they're very different from the adults people are used to seeing. ""Adult fireflies are really just the tip of the firefly iceberg,"" Lewis said.  While adults aboveground are focused on reproduction, fireflies are similar to teenagers in their juvenile stage: focused on eating and growing, Lewis said. They eat snails, slugs and earthworms. They have sharp jaws and inject paralyzing neurotoxins into their prey. ""The larvae are incredibly voracious predators, they're really fierce,"" Lewis said.  When cold weather arrives, the larvae burrow down below frost level and don't move around until it warms up in the spring, when they burrow back up again, Lewis said.  The larvae also don't look like the adult fireflies people are used to seeing; they look more similar to pill bugs, commonly known as roly poly. After the larva stage, fireflies have a short stage as a pupa before emerging as adults. Adult fireflies in the southern U.S. start to emerge in March, April and May, while they begin coming out in June and July further north, Fallon said. There are three general types of fireflies in the U.S., Fallon said. There are daytime dark fireflies, which are active during the day and use pheromones rather than lights to communicate. There are also glowworms. Male glowworms, which generally don't light up, have enormous eyes. They look for flightless females giving off dim light on the ground. The there's the flashing species, which is the kind most people recognize. ""Those flashes are directly related to courtship in the adults. Each species has a species-specific flash pattern it uses,"" Fallon said. ""Typically the males will be flying around flashing a specific single, searching for a female. And if a female is interested, she'll have her own specific flash that she'll flash back to this male."" When not searching for a mate and focusing on reproducing, the fireflies might rest in the crevices of bark or in vegetation. They'll hang out in areas where they can get some protection from predators and in moist areas. Fireflies need moisture in each of their life cycles, Lewis said. It's not just the eggs that can dry out; larvae and pupae can also dry out and die if there's not enough moisture. Drought is one of the most serious threats faced by fireflies.  About 10% of the firefly species in the U.S. are not doing well, Lewis said. Some of the firefly species most vulnerable to extinction need very specific habitats to survive.  Light pollution is also a threat to fireflies. It can prevent male and female fireflies from finding each other so they can mate, reducing the population of the next generation of fireflies.  ""Love can be hard to find for even the brightest of fireflies,"" according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. ""Even the interfering light of a full moon can outshine their visual morse code, making it impossible for males and females to recognize each other. Light pollution from towns, factories and roads have been seriously killing the buzz for these insects"" Overuse of pesticides is also impacting lightning bug species everywhere. Fallon advises being conscientious of the fireflies when taking care of lawns. She suggests mowing less often or leaving the grass taller. If possible, leave some corner of the yard a bit wild so the fireflies — eggs, larvae, pupae and adults — have a safe space.  The advice applies year round, not just in the spring and summer when flashes of light are visible. ""So many just people just think about fireflies when they're these flashing adults for a few weeks in the summer, but the reality is that they're present all year long, we're just not noticing them or seeing them,"" Fallon said.

         Four Israeli hostages taken by Hamas militants from a music festival during the group's Oct. 7 terrorist attack were rescued alive Saturday during a raid on the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and 41-year-old Shlomi Ziv were all kidnapped at the Nova music festival. They were recovered after the IDF announced it was striking ""terrorist infrastructure"" in central Gaza. A joint statement said the hostages were rescued from two different locations during the operation, and that ""their medical condition is normal."" The rescue operation came amid a major Israeli air and ground offensive in central Gaza that has killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians, including at least 94 on Saturday. Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and captured around 250 others, including men, women, children and older adults. More than 100, mostly women and children, were freed in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last year. Over 36,700 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israeli authorities believe the militants are still holding around 120 hostages, with 43 believed to be dead. Survivors include about 15 women, two children under the age of 5 and two men in their 80s. Here is everything we know of the four freed captives. The 26-year-old Argamani has emerged as an icon of the agonizing hostage crisis that is still far from over. She appeared in a series of videos that captured the painful trajectory of their plight. In the first, filmed by the attackers, she is being forced onto a motorbike by several men after being seized with her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, whose whereabouts are still unknown. ""Don't kill me!"" she screamed with one arm outstretched, the other pinned down. In another video released by Hamas in mid-January, she appeared gaunt and spoke — almost certainly under duress — of other hostages being killed in airstrikes months into Israel's massive offensive. And then there was a third video, she was seen in family photos in the background as her mother, a Chinese immigrant to Israel who has stage four brain cancer, pleaded with her captors to release her only child so she could see her before she dies. ""I want to see her one more time. Talk to her one more time,"" Liora Argamani, 61, said. ""I don't have a lot of time left in this world."" Argamani's father told Army Radio the reunion with her mother ""very difficult"" as Liora was ""just unable to express her feelings and could not say what she was really waiting to say to Noa."" Argamani began dating Or about two years ago after they met while attending Ben-Gurion University in her hometown of Beersheba and were planning to move in together in Tel Aviv, his mother told Israel's Ynet news website. She said her son had majored in electrical engineering and had been hired by the international tech giant Nvidia. Yonatan Levi, a friend of Argamani, told The Associated Press that she is a smart, free spirit who loved parties and traveling and was studying computer science. He said he had met her at a diving course in the Israeli city of Eilat on the Red Sea, and that a few months before her abduction she had asked him for help navigating insurance claims for her mother's care. A 22-year-old from a small town near Tel Aviv, Meir Jan had finished his army service three months before the attack at the music festival, according to the Times of Israel, an English-language Israeli website. A forum set up by families of the hostages said he was supposed to start a job at a tech company the day after the attack. Meir Jan's aunt, Dina, said his father had died on Friday, hours before the operation. ""My brother died of grief, and he didn't get to see Almog return,"" she told Israel's Kan public broadcaster. The 27-year-old Kozlov was working as a security guard at the festival. He had immigrated from Russia to Israel alone a year and a half earlier, and his mother came to the country after Oct. 7, Israeli media reported. In a phone call with Israel's President Isaac Herzog after his release, Kozlov spoke a mixture of English and Hebrew. He joked that his Hebrew had gotten better in captivity, saying, ""I had a lot of practice with my new friends,"" referring to his fellow hostages. Ziv is from a farming community in northern Israel and was working as an usher and had gone to the music festival with two friends who were both killed, the Times of Israel reported. The Israel Hayom newspaper said the 41-year-old and his wife of 17 years had been trying to have children. Haley Ott contributed to this report. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Editor's Note: This story has been updated to correct the ages of Argamani, Meir Jan and Ziv, who marked birthdays in captivity. The army had earlier provided their ages when they were abducted.

Updated on:  June 8, 2024 / 8:09 PM EDT
          / AP
         President Biden said France was America's ""first friend"" at its founding and is one of its closest allies more than two centuries later as he was honored with a state visit Saturday by French President Emmanuel Macron aimed at showing off their partnership on global security issues and easing past trade tensions. Mr. Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements used to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion. But Macron and Mr. Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defense, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package. The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Élysées leading to the Élysée Palace, where the two held official meetings and delivered public statements. Later, there was a state dinner held at the palace for Mr. Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden. ""United we stand, divided we fall,"" Macron said in toasting Mr. Biden at the state dinner. ""Allied we are and allied we will stay.""   The American president followed Macron's toast by saying the U.S. and France have been ""unyielding as well as unwavering in our partnership,"" adding, ""That's what democracies do.""   Mr. Biden and Macron put the war in Ukraine at the top of Saturday's agenda, but it was the strength of the countries' long alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago but with roots far deeper, that was the centerpiece of the weekend. Calling himself a student of French history, Biden said the visit was a ""great honor"" and he noted that America's ties to France date to the Revolutionary War. ""France was our first friend,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It remains one of our best friends."" Macron praised Mr. Biden as not just the leader of a world power but also for bringing the ""clarity and loyalty of a partner that loves and respects the Europeans."" It appeared to be a subtle criticism of former President Donald Trump, whose ""America First"" foreign policy has shaken European leaders. They are now contending, gingerly, with the possibility of his return to power next year should the presumptive Republican nominee defeat the Democratic incumbent in November's election. Macron hosted Trump for Bastille Day in 2017, and the French president came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured. Despite disagreements over whether to send allies trainers onto Ukrainian soil to support the country's defense against Russia's invasion, Macron insisted that, ""I think we see eye to eye on this war raging in Ukraine. He tempered his previous concerns about U.S. commitment to Europe — which he has used to argue that the continent must do more to provide for its own defense — to praise Biden's leadership: ""Thank you for being at Europe's side."" Macron expressed hope that when the Group of Seven leaders meet this coming week in Italy they will agree to a $50 billion ""solidarity fund"" for Ukraine that will be backed by sanctioned Russian assets. The two leaders also celebrated the rescue Saturday by Israeli forces of four hostages taken by Hamas. ""We won't stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached,"" Biden said as Macron called out the Israeli government for not doing more to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Macron said he supported a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory and allow for the release of more hostages. The U.S. has said it is awaiting Hamas' formal response to the potential deal. The French leader raised the issue of U.S. trade practices that he has often criticized, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favors American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the U.S., like China, has ""decided not to respect the rules of global trade"" by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe's industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation. As the pair met outside the palace, Biden appeared to suggest to his host that that the U.S. and Europe could ""coordinate together,"" and he was heard telling Macron about his most recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was objecting to steep U.S. tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the COVID-19 pandemic receded. As the president's trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday's European Parliament election while Macron's pro-European Union movement is flagging.

          / AP
         Austrian-Canadian auto parts billionaire Frank Stronach was arrested on sexual assault charges spanning decades, police said. The 91-year-old was charged Friday with five crimes including rape, indecent assault on a female, sexual assault and forcible confinement, Peel Regional Police said. He was released with conditions and will appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton, Ontario, at a later date, the police statement said. Peel Regional Police Constable Tyler Bell said there is more than one accuser but declined to say how many. ""Obviously, this is a high-profile case. Our special victims unit is bound to protect the victims and in doing so that's why were are being vague,"" Bell said. ""There is more than one victim but we won't confirm that number yet."" Police allege the sexual assaults occurred from the 1980s to as recent as 2023. Bell said they are appealing for people to come forward if they have information or have been victims. Stronach didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. He has hired prominent Canadian defense lawyer Brian Greenspan. ""Mr. Stronach categorically denies the allegations of impropriety which have been brought against him,"" Greenspan said in an e-mail. ""He looks forward to the opportunity to fully respond to the charges and to maintain his legacy both as a philanthropist and as an icon of the Canadian business community."" Stronach, born in Austria, became one of Canada's wealthiest people by creating Magna in his garage in 1957 and building it into one of the world's largest suppliers of auto parts. He also founded The Stronach Group, a company specializing in horse racing. He made a brief foray into Austrian politics more than a decade ago and has been named to the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest honors. A Magna spokesperson said Stronach has had no affiliation with the company since relinquishing control in 2010. ""We have recently been made aware of the charges filed against Frank Stronach,"" Dave Niemiec said in an email Friday evening. ""Magna has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media."" Niemiec said the company would not comment further on the ongoing legal matter. In 2018, Stronach sued his daughter, two grandchildren and former business associate Alon Ossip for over $500 million in Ontario Superior Court alleging they mismanaged the family's assets which he wanted to take back control of. Belinda Stronach, a former Canadian Member of Parliament, countersued her father, saying in a statement of defense that he lost vast sums of money on pet projects. The case was later settled.

12,,Missing mother found dead inside python's belly in Indonesia,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/python-swallows-woman-whole-indonesia/,"When villagers cut open the python's stomach, ""Farida's head was immediately visible,"" an official said.",2024-06-08T17:58:00Z,"
Updated on:  June 8, 2024 / 6:45 PM EDT
          / CBS/AFP
         A woman has been found dead inside the belly of a snake after it swallowed her whole in central Indonesia, a local official said Saturday, marking at least the fifth person to be devoured by a python in the country since 2017. The husband of 45-year-old Farida and residents of Kalempang village in South Sulawesi province discovered her on Friday inside the reticulated python, which measured around five meters (16 feet). The mother-of-four had gone missing Thursday night and failed to return home, forcing a search effort, village head Suardi Rosi told AFP. Her husband ""found her belongings... which made him suspicious. The villagers then searched the area. They soon spotted a python with a large belly,"" said Suardi. ""They agreed to cut open the python's stomach. As soon as they did, Farida's head was immediately visible."" Farida was found fully clothed inside the snake. Graphic video published by TMZ appeared to show the snake being cut open in a wooded area while more footage posted by the Daily Mail appeared to show the woman's body being carried in a blanket past distressed villagers. Reticulated pythons grab onto their prey with dozens of sharp curved teeth and then squeeze it to death before swallowing it whole. They are widespread in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, and are known to eat monkeys, pigs and other mammals. Reports of humans being killed by pythons are extremely rare but several people have died in Indonesia in recent years after being swallowed whole by pythons. Last year, residents in Southeast Sulawesi's Tinanggea district killed an eight-meter python, which was found strangling and eating one of the farmers in a village. In 2022, a woman in Indonesia's Jambi province was killed and swallowed whole by a python, the BBC reported, citing local media. In 2018, a woman was found dead inside a seven-meter python in Southeast Sulawesi's Muna town. Officials said the victim, 54-year-old Wa Tiba, went missing while checking her vegetable garden near her village.    In 2017, a farmer in West Sulawesi went missing before being found eaten alive by a four-meter python at a palm oil plantation. A six-minute video obtained by CBS News showed villagers slicing open the python's carcass to reveal the legs and torso of the dead victim, named Akbar. Villagers said the victim was likely ambushed from behind. The reticulated python is the longest snake in the world, according to London's Natural History Museum. They are native to Southern Asia and can grow to be more than 20 feet long. The longest reticulated python ever found in the wild was discovered in 1912, according to the museum, and was measured to be nearly 33 feet long – ""more than half the length of a bowling lane and makes this snake longer than a giraffe is tall.""  Zoo Atlanta, which houses reticulated pythons, says the snakes ""have a reputation for being aggressive."" The snakes are occasionally kept as pets in the U.S. Last year, a 14-foot-long reticulated python was found dead on side of the road on Long Island, prompting a search for its owner. In 2022, a 16-foot albino reticulated python that slithered through a Texas neighborhood for months was finally rescued and returned to its owner.

Updated on:  June 8, 2024 / 7:17 PM EDT
          / AP
         Dornoch pulled off a major upset to take the first Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, hugging the rail and holding off Mindframe to win the Triple Crown finale at odds of 17-1. The horse co-owned by World Series champion Jayson Werth won the Belmont five weeks after a troubled trip led to a 10th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby. This time, Dornoch sat off leader Seize the Grey, passed the Preakness winner down the stretch and held on. It's the first win in any Triple Crown for trainer Danny Gargan and the second in the Belmont for jockey Luis Saez. ""He's one of the top 3-year-olds in the country, and we've always thought it,"" Gargan said. ""We let him run his race and he won. If he gets to run, he's always going to be tough to beat. It's the sixth consecutive year a different horse won each of the three Triple Crown races. Sierra Leone, the Derby runner-up who went off as the favorite, was third and Honor Marie fourth. ""When I rode this horse here in Saratoga for the first time (July 29), I told Danny, 'You have the Derby winner,'"" Saez said. ""Unfortunately, the Derby's a crazy race and we draw that No. 1 hole. Today, we have pretty good confidence that we could win this race."" Despite there not being a Triple Crown on the line, it's a historic Belmont because the race was run at Saratoga for the first time in the venue's 161-year history. It returns next year while Belmont Park undergoes a massive, $455 reconstruction with the plan for the Triple Crown to return to the New York track in 2026. The Belmont was run at the venerable track in Saratoga Springs for the first time in its 161-year history. Saratoga has become a summer horse racing oasis and was the natural choice for where to move the Triple Crown finale in 2024 and '25 while Belmont Park in New York undergoes a massive $455 million reconstruction project. Having it at Saratoga necessitated shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles from the usual ""test of the champion 1 1/2-mile distance that has been a hallmark of the Belmont for nearly a century. The temporary change contributed to getting more quality horses into the field who previously ran in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness or both.

         WNBA rookie Caitlin Clark will not be headed to Paris next month for the summer Olympic Games, according to multiple reports. The 22-year-old star was reportedly left off the Team USA roster, the Associated Press and The Athletic reported, citing sources. No official announcement has been made. The AP, which received the full roster from a person familiar with the decision, reported that while Clark won't be headed to Paris, the U.S. is expected to field a star-packed team as it seeks another gold medal. The U.S. women have won every gold medal in women's basketball since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Team USA is expected to take five-time gold medalist Diana Taurasi for a sixth Olympics. She will be joined by Phoenix Mercury teammate Brittney Griner, who will mark the first time playing internationally since she was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months in 2022. Griner said she would only play abroad for the Olympics. Joining the pair will be Olympic veterans Breanna Stewart, A'ja Wilson, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd and Chelsea Gray. Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, who helped the U.S. win the inaugural 3x3 gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021, will also be on the team. A number of first-time Olympians will be on the team with Alyssa Thomas, Sabrina Ionescu and Kahleah Copper. All three played on the American team which won the World Cup in Australia in 2022. Taurasi, who turns 42 before the Paris Games begin, will break the record for most Olympics played in the sport of basketball. Five players, including former teammate Sue Bird, have competed in five. The U.S. team will get together to train for a few days in Phoenix in July. Then it's off to London for an exhibition game against Germany before heading to France. The Americans will play Japan, Belgium and Germany in pool play at the Olympics. The men's basketball roster was announced in April.

18,,Iga Swiatek wins her third consecutive French Open women's title,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iga-swiatek-french-open-womens-title-defeating-jasmine-paolini/,The 23-year-old from Poland is the first woman with three trophies in a row in Paris since Justine Henin from 2005 to 2007.,2024-06-08T15:18:53Z,"

         Iga Swiatek won her third consecutive French Open championship and fourth in five years by defeating Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 in the final on Saturday. The top-seeded Swiatek trailed 2-1 early in Court Philippe Chatrier before taking the next 10 games to claim the opening set and go up 5-0 in the second. She stretched her winning streak at Roland Garros to 21 matches, and her career record at the place is now 35-2. The 23-year-old from Poland is the first woman with three trophies in a row in Paris since Justine Henin from 2005 to 2007. Swiatek also won the French Open in 2020 and the U.S. Open in 2022 and is now 5-0 in major finals. The 12th-seeded Paolini, a 28-year-old from Italy, was appearing in a Slam final for the first time. She had never been past the second round at one of the four most important tennis tournaments until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January. Paolini will play in the French Open women's doubles final on Sunday with partner Sara Errani against 2023 U.S. Open singles champion Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova. After a scare in the second round against Naomi Osaka, when Swiatek needed to save a match point, this represented a fifth straight lopsided win. Swiatek took every set in that span and only ceded a total of 17 games. On Saturday, a loud chant of ""Let's go, Jasmine! Let's go!"" arose from two rows of Paolini's supporters in the lower bowl of the stands, each one wearing a T-shirt in one of the colors of the Italian flag: green, white or red. They would reprise that song, in English, interspersing it with claps. During the coin toss, Paolini stood mostly still, while Swiatek went through her usual paces, shifting side to side and taking cuts of forehands and backhands. After Swiatek got the match's first point, a fan yelled in French, ""Jasmine, it's not over!"" And, actually, it soon looked as if they were right. That's because Swiatek went through a bit of a shaky stretch, failing to convert a break point in the second game, then getting broken to trail 2-1 after 13 minutes when she flubbed a forehand, sending it way long. That was Swiatek's seventh unforced error of the afternoon; Paolini had made only one by then. Might a true surprise be in the offing? Could Paolini not only make a match of this, but actually win it? Um, no. Swiatek immediately reset herself and began playing the sort of tennis that has kept her at No. 1 in the WTA rankings for nearly every week since April 2022. The instincts and footwork to get to almost any shot an opponent can offer. The intimidating, heavy-spin forehands. The prematch strategy and midmatch adjustments that can shift things her way. And once Swiatek got going, there was nothing Paolini could do to slow her down. Swiatek broke at love right away, capping the game with a return winner off a serve at 87 mph (140 kph). The following game began with a 25-stroke exchange that Swiatek ended with a backhand winner that Paolini did not even try to chase, and it quickly became 3-2. That was part of a stretch in which Swiatek earned 20 of the last 24 points in the first set. The one-way traffic continued in the next set, and after just 1 hour, 8 minutes of play, Swiatek was celebrating by dropping to her knees behind a baseline. Soon, she was sitting on the sideline and used her phone to snap a selfie while holding up four fingers to represent her haul of French Open trophies.

         A Disneyland employee died after she fell from a moving golf cart and hit her head at the theme park in Anaheim. The woman was identified as 60-year-old Bonnye Mavis Lear of Fullerton, according to Orange County coroner's spokesperson Sgt. Frank Gonzalez.   Authorities responded around 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 5, to the area of West Ball Road and South West Street in Disneyland's private Club 33 for a report of a crash. When police arrived at the scene, they discovered Lear fell off a moving golf cart and hit her head. She was taken to the hospital and died on Friday from her injuries, according to the Anaheim Police Department.  Ken Potrock, president of the Disneyland Resort, expressed his condolences and said the company was focused on supporting her family and coworkers. ""We are heartbroken by the loss of Bonnye and offer our sincere condolences to everyone who cared for her,"" said Ken Potrock, Disneyland Resort president. His statement continued to say, ""we are focused on supporting her family and our cast members through this tragic event and making sure they have the resources they need."" Lear worked in membership support services at Club 33, a members-only restaurant and lounge located in the New Orleans Square area of the park. Amy Maetzold is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

         Harvey Weinstein, 72, appealed his conviction for sexually assaulting a model actress in a Los Angeles hotel room more than a decade ago. His attorneys filed in the Second District Court of Appeal on Friday a year after indicating their intention for a new trial in the 2022 Los Angeles case. The model-actress is one of the four women involved in the case against Weinstein, who was found guilty of the sexual assault charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a Los Angeles courtroom in February 2023. Weinstein's attorneys   received a series of extensions over the past year from the court to allow them more time to prepare the documents. RELATED: Harvey Weinstein appears in N.Y. court; Why prosecutors say they want a September retrial Weinstein was convicted in December 2022 of one count each of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by a foreign object in February 2013, on a woman identified only as Jane Doe No. 1. The jury at the time could not come to a unanimous decision on three other charges, including one related to Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker and the wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.  The jury acquitted Weinstein of a felony charge of sexual battery by restraint involving an alleged attack on a masseuse, Jane Doe No. 3 in 2010, but deadlocked on a lesser count involving the same woman.  The judge noted that the misdemeanor count was not charged, and the prosecution said in December that it didn't intend to move forward involving that alleged victim. Prosecutors later said they did not intend to retry Weinstein on the counts on which jurors deadlocked. Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison. RELATED: Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction overturned by New York's highest court In appealing the conviction, Weinstein is hoping for a similar outcome as the one he received in New York, where an appeals court in April overturned his conviction on rape charges in that state. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison for that conviction. New York prosecutors are expected to retry the case. Amy Maetzold is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

         Among all the factors on voters' minds this election, former President Donald Trump's guilty verdict pales in comparison to issues like the economy, inflation, and the border — all items on which Trump maintains advantages. As such, the verdict has not dramatically reshaped the race.  But what we do see is a few more Joe Biden voters activated out of opposition to Trump. His vote has become increasingly centered around anti-Trump sentiment, more so than affinity for Mr. Biden himself. Today, most of Mr. Biden's voters say their main rationale is opposing Trump, and that's up from March.  Whether that dynamic is enough to sustain Mr. Biden looms as one of the central questions of this campaign — a contest that today is essentially tied in likely voter preference, both nationally and across the collective battleground states. Among Trump's voters, the verdict is a wash. A few say it's a reason to show him support, a few say they're backing him despite it, and the great bulk of them say it doesn't matter either way. A majority say Trump's conviction is not a factor in their vote decision. In fact, the trial ranks much lower as a factor when considered on its own than every other issue tested. Most of Mr. Biden's voters now say their main rationale is to oppose Trump, not because they like Mr. Biden — an increase in this rationale since March. (Mr. Biden capitalized on this kind of sentiment in 2020 too, as substantial numbers expressed it in many battleground states that year.) Moreover, we see this dynamic again in how people frame their vote decision, along the lines of whether this election is a referendum or a choice. When people say this election is just about their view on Trump, most vote for Mr. Biden.  However, when people instead see this race as a judgment just on Mr. Biden, they vote for Trump. And when they're framing it as a comparison between the two, slightly more are voting for Trump than Mr. Biden. Here's why that direct comparison right now favors Trump: Trump outpaces Mr. Biden on a range of qualities like being seen as effective, tough, energetic and — more narrowly — competent. Also, more think Trump has a vision of where he wants to lead the country. Mr. Biden does better on personal likability and being viewed as compassionate. But that likability gap does not match vote preferences, because a lot of people who dislike Trump personally are voting for Trump anyway. And here's what partially insulates Trump after the trial verdict: so many of his backers, and Republican base, have seen the charges as not serious and the trial as politically motivated.  In fact, most Republicans believe that the prosecution in New York was brought on not by decisions by New York prosecutors, but at the direction of the Biden administration. Looking forward, if he's elected, that view may have implications for what they'd want Trump to do in turn. Half of Republicans want Trump to get revenge against his political opponents by investigating and bringing criminal charges against them — a number that rises among MAGA Republicans. There's broad support for Mr. Biden's recent executive order dealing with the border, including from most Republicans, but despite that, voters who place a high priority on the border are backing Trump by a large margin.  Voters still tend to think migrant crossings will go down more under Trump. Meanwhile, Trump has talked about the actions he would take toward immigration if elected to a second term, including deportation efforts.  A nearly six in 10 majority of voters say they would favor, in principle, a new government program to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. (That isn't purely partisan, it includes a third of Democrats. It rises to nine in 10 Republicans.) A similarly sized majority would have local law enforcement try to identify those living in the U.S. illegally, and just under half support the idea of setting up large government detention centers to sort out which people ought to be deported. Views of the national economy are more negative today than they were in March, and voters' financial concerns continue to lead to more Trump support. This, despite positive macro numbers in the jobs report and stock market. But inflation — likely a proxy term for still-high prices — continues to affect voters. Trump is up more than 2 to 1 among those who say higher prices have been a hardship. And Trump leads Mr. Biden big among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote. More continue to think they will be financially better off with Trump in office than with Mr. Biden. Nationally, Mr. Biden's support from some key parts of his base have inched up a bit from March, including women. More women now call abortion a major factor in their vote than they did in March and those that do go big for Mr. Biden. The president's support among Black voters continues to lag behind his 2020 performance, but it has improved since the spring. More Black voters now say he fights for people like them than said so in March. Mr. Biden has improved a bit with independents compared to our last national poll in early March. (Given that time frame, it's not precisely clear when that shift may have occurred.) That said, there is some anti-Trump sentiment among the independents now backing Mr. Biden. A larger majority of them are doing so now to oppose Trump. But Mr. Biden does not have a meaningful advantage among Hispanics, a group he won handily in 2020. More Hispanic voters think they will be financially better off if Trump wins than if Mr. Biden does. Trump continues to do well with White voters without a college degree and with older voters, groups that backed him in 2016 and 2020. And despite speculation about the ""anti-Trump"" vote in the GOP primaries, more than nine in 10 Republicans are backing Trump, similar to the number of Democrats who are backing Mr. Biden. Much of these same patterns play out across the battleground states. Nationally, Republicans have a turnout advantage helping lift Trump, but in the battleground states, Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say they'll definitely vote, perhaps due to campaigns trying to activate their voters there. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,063 U.S. adult residents interviewed between June 5-7, 2024. The data includes an oversample in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The sample was weighted by gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±3.2 points among all adults and ±3.8 points among registered voters. Toplines

28,,Body believed to be missing TV doctor Michael Mosley found in Greece,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/body-believed-to-be-michael-mosley-missing-british-doctor-and-tv-presenter-found-on-greek-island/,"A body believed to be the missing British doctor and TV presenter Michael Mosley was found on the Greek island of Symi, police said.",2024-06-09T13:20:56Z,"

          / CBS/AP
         The body of missing British doctor and TV presenter Michael Mosley was found Sunday morning on the Greek island where he was last seen, his family said. The discovery followed a huge search operation that got underway after Mosley disappeared while on a walk Wednesday. ""Michael was an adventurous man, it's part of what made him so special,"" said his wife, Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley, in a statement to the Associated Press. ""It's devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together."" Mosley's wife said he took the wrong route on a hike and collapsed in a place where he couldn't be seen easily, The Associated Press reported, citing her statement. Authorities confirmed earlier Sunday that a body was found amid what became an extensive multi-day search for Mosley, but they did not publicly identify the remains. CBS News partner network BBC News cited Greek police spokesperson Konstantia Dimoglidou as saying Monday that an initial post-mortem exam found no injuries on Mosley's body that could have caused his death, and that it was being attributed to natural causes. Dimoglidou told the BBC that Mosley's time of death was recorded as late on Wednesday afternoon, the day he disappeared. The body was found on a rocky coast by searchers on a private boat, about a 30-minute walk from the village of Pedi where Mosley was believed to be seen Wednesday before disappearing, according to various officials including a police spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation. Formal identification was still pending. But a police source told the BBC, a CBS News partner, that the person had been dead ""for a number of days."" Mosley went missing Wednesday afternoon on the Greek island of Symi after going for a walk. His disappearance last week prompted a major search operation involving the coast guard, police and fire officials, who used drones, a police dog and a helicopter as they worked through several days of high temperatures to locate him. Lefteris Papakalodoukas, the island's mayor, told The Associated Press he was on the boat with members of the media when they saw a body some 20 meters above the Agia Marina beach a little after 10 a.m. ""We zoomed with the cameras and saw it was him,"" he said.  The mayor said the body appeared to have fallen down a steep slope, stopping against a fence and lying face-up with a few rocks on top of it. The body had a leather bag in one hand, said Antonis Mystiloglou, a cameraman with state TV ERT, who was also on the boat. A coroner has already examined the body, the BBC reported. Police spokesperson Konstantia Dimoglidou told the network that authorities needed to rule out the possibility of foul play. ""We need to get a first insight into the causes of death and whether [it] preceded the person's fall to the ground,"" Dimoglidou told the BBC. Mosley, 67, was well-known in Britain for his regular appearances on television and radio and his column in the Daily Mail newspaper. He was nominated in 2022 for an Emmy Award for his work as an executive producer on the BBC science documentary ""The Human Face,"" which featured stars like Elizabeth Hurley, Pierce Brosnan and David Attenborough.  Outside of the U.K., Mosley was also known for his 2013 book ""The Fast Diet,"" which he co-authored with journalist Mimi Spencer. The book proposed the so-called ""5:2 diet,"" which promised to help people lose weight quickly by minimizing their calorie intake two days a week while eating healthily on the other five. He subsequently introduced a rapid weight loss program and has made a number of films about diet and exercise. Mosley often pushed his body to extreme lengths to see the effects of his diets and also lived with tapeworms in his guts for six weeks for the BBC documentary ""Infested! Living With Parasites."" Mosley shared four children with his wife, who is a doctor, author and health columnist. In her statement to the Associated Press confirming her husband's death, Claire Bailey Mosley thanked the people of Symi, who she said worked tirelessly to find him. ""Some of these people on the island, who hadn't even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked,"" she said. ""My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It's clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.""

          / AP
         Coco Gauff won her first Grand Slam doubles title by teaming with Katerina Siniakova for the French Open trophy on Sunday. Gauff, a 20-year-old American who won the U.S. Open singles title last year, and Siniakova, who is from the Czech Republic, defeated Italians Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Court Philippe Chatrier. It was Gauff's third women's doubles final after losing championship matches at Roland Garros in 2022 and the U.S. Open in 2021. Gauff and Siniakova both kissed the Coupe Simonne Mathieu — the winners' trophy. ""Third time's a charm. Thank you, Katerina, for playing with me. We decided two days before the tournament to play together,"" Gauff said. ""Thank you to the fans. I know 11:30 Sunday morning is early for most people. It's early for me."" Paolini was also the runner-up in the singles final at Roland Garros to four-time champion Iga Swiatek on Saturday. Swiatek beat Gauff in the singles semifinal. ""The last two weeks were very nice, very emotional,"" Paolini said. ""I have a lot of memories. I can't wait to be back."" Siniakova owns a career Slam in women's doubles alongside partner Barbora Krejcikova and has won eight majors — including the French Open in 2018 and 2021. Errani also owns a career Slam in doubles alongside her former partner Roberta Vinci. The Italian pair won the French Open title in 2012 — the year Errani lost the singles final. ""It's really special to be in this court again. I don't know how many more years I have to play. But it's always special to play these kinds of matches,"" the 37-year-old Errani said. ""It will be special to play the Olympics here in this place. So I'll see you in one month."" Paolini was playing in her first final in women's doubles. Errani's serve was broken twice in the first set, and Paolini stayed on the baseline to compensate in the 11th game. The tactic worked as Errani held serve. Gauff and Siniakova took the first set when Errani's volley at the net went long and raced to a 4-1 lead in the second set, with Paolini 0-30 down on her serve. The Italians fought back to 4-3 with a service game to follow, but Errani's serve was broken again and their momentum was lost.

To level up your coverage and get access to sports and content broadcast on ESPN and TNT, subscribe to the Orange + Blue tier plan. The Blue tier is $45 per month. The Sling's Orange + Blue tier costs $60 per month, but the platform currently offers 50% off the first month of any pricing tier, making the Orange + Blue tier $30 for the first month.   Note: Because Sling TV doesn't carry CBS, you won't be able to watch CBS-aired programming like next year's NFL games on CBS. To watch these games, plus PGA golf, UEFA Champions League and more live sports, we recommend you also subscribe to Paramount+ with Showtime. Paramount+ with Showtime costs $12 per month after a one-week free trial.   Top features of Sling TV Orange + Blue tier:  You can also catch today's game on Fubo. Fubo is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to ABC and ESPN, in addition to almost every NFL game next season.   To watch the NBA Finals without cable, start a seven-day free trial of Fubo. You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer.

Or upgrade to the Fubo Elite tier and get all the Fubo Extra channels, plus the ability to stream in 4K, starting at $90 per month ($70 for the first month).   Top features of FuboTV Pro Tier:  You can watch today's game with the Hulu + Live TV/ESPN+ bundle. The bundle features 95 channels, including ABC, TNT, local network affiliates and ESPN. It also includes the ESPN+ streaming service. Unlimited DVR storage is also included. Watch today's game, the 2024 NBA playoffs, MLB this season and network-aired NFL games next season with Hulu + Live TV/ESPN+ bundle.   Hulu + Live TV comes bundled with ESPN+ and Disney+. It's priced at $77 per month after a three-day free trial.   You can also watch today's game on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDTV channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.   For anyone living in a partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch NBA basketball without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable.   This amplified digital antenna with a 50-mile range can receive hundreds of HDTV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox and Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It delivers a high-quality picture in 1080p HDTV and top-tier sound.   Rooting from home is more fun while repping your team with the latest NBA fan gear.

         Part of Teton Pass, a crucial highway weaving through the mountains of western Wyoming, collapsed Saturday morning in a massive landslide that severed the primary transit route between two cities in the region. Officials said they expect the road will remain closed long-term, potentially jeopardizing almost half the workforce in and around the tourist hubs of Jackson Hole, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park. Crews were still examining the site on Monday to determine whether it would be possible to construct some kind of interim road for travelers in place of the collapsed section of the highway. The Wyoming Department of Transportation said that current evaluations from engineers and geologists suggested they would be able to build a temporary detour around the landslide. According to transportation officials, that detour could be open to the public as soon as a few weeks from now. ""Currently, WYDOT geologists and engineers are confident they can build a safe, temporary detour around the slide area using local fill material and paving two temporary lanes,"" the agency said in a social media post.  ‼ IMPORTANT TETON PASS UPDATE ‼ 
Teton Pass road closure continues, interim detour planned

WYDOT Teton County closed access to Wyoming State Highway 22/ Teton Pass due to a landslide at milepost 12.8 and a mudslide at milepost 15. Commuters have been asked to detour around using US 26 through Swan Valley and then into the Snake River Canyon. WYDOT crews are currently evaluating the stability of the area and investigating adjacent areas for potential safety hazards. This is being considered an extended closure, and there currently is no estimated opening date.  

WYDOT crews have been working closely with other agencies and partners to secure the area and explore potential interim access, as well as long term reconstruction options. Currently, WYDOT geologists and engineers are confident they can build a safe, temporary detour around the slide area using local fill material and paving two temporary lanes. They are hoping to have a temporary detour open to the public, likely with some strict weight and width restrictions, in a few weeks.  

“I want to express my gratitude to WYDOT Director Westby and his entire team for their efforts to rapidly develop and implement a plan to get traffic moving over Teton Pass again as quickly as possible,” Governor Mark Gordon said.

Geologists and engineers are evaluating the area and putting together a long term plan to rebuild the road. There is no current estimated timeline for that construction. WYDOT will be flying the area with a survey plane and doing some geological drilling in preparation for the reconstruction.  

WYDOT is working closely with the US Forest Service to provide access to recreation areas outside the slide area, despite the road closure. Agencies are collaborating to place signage on the road to allow users to access campsites unaffected by both the landslide at milepost 12.8 and the mudslide at milepost 15. Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National park remain open for visitors. 

Crews continue to manage the mudslide at milepost 15, and geologists and engineers are working on a plan to provide more drainage to the affected area by installing a box culvert. They are planning to do this work simultaneously with the temporary detour work at milepost 12.8. The work is dependent on availability of crews and materials, but WYDOT’s goal is to have this work completed when the temporary detour at 12.8 is ready for limited traffic.  

Governor Mark Gordon has issued an Executive Order declaring an emergency in response to both the mudslide at milepost 15 and the landslide at milepost 12.8. The declaration will help the state access additional resources from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to begin the substantial repairs required.

WYDOT is thankful for the quick responsiveness and support from other government agencies, including the US Forest Service and the Idaho Transportation Department, which has allowed WYDOT to mobilize quickly with planning and repairs.  

""WYDOT’s response through this crisis demonstrates the commitment, passion and ingenuity of our crews,” said WYDOT director Darin Westby. “We certainly want to thank ​the Governor, the Federal Highway Administration, the Idaho Transportation Department, the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, Evans Construction and the US Forest Service​ for their quick response, teamwork and dependability in our time of need.”

The video below shows the highway in 2023 compared to what it looked like June 8. 

(reporters, we now have a media kit available: https://www.dot.state.wy.us/home/news_info/media-kits.html ) The update came as concerns mounted over the possible economic implications of the Teton Pass collapse. After it happened, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon declared a state of emergency in hopes that federal funding would allow the state to access the resources required to begin permanent repairs on the highway, which officials have said are ""substantial."" The Teton County branch of the transportation department initially announced early Saturday that the road at milepost 12.8 on Teton Pass had ""catastrophically failed,"" and shared several images on social media that showed the extent of the damage. Officials said crews were trying to build a detour around the initial collapse when the landslide broke down further and effectively destroyed a whole section of the surrounding highway. No one was injured. ""WYDOT is now reviewing a long term solution and repairs, and more information on planning efforts will be available soon,"" the department said in their announcement. At the time, crews were also working to clear debris from another mudslide at the 15th mile mark on Teton Pass. The roadway at milepost 12.8 on Teton Pass, has catastrophically failed, and a long term closure is expected. WYDOT... Carved into the Teton mountain range and running for about 17 miles, Teton Pass is the only direct route between Victor, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyoming. Despite being notoriously treacherous at certain times of year, and typically closed during those times because of weather-related safety concerns, the highway provides vital access to Teton County, which includes Jackson, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, for workers who commute there from eastern Idaho.  ""We understand this highway is a lifeline for commuters, deliveries, medical care access and tourism, especially with limited alternatives and the summer season upon us,"" said Darin Westby, the director of the Wyoming Department of Transportation, in a statement after the collapse. ""WYDOT engineers, surveyors and geologists mobilized quickly to try to maintain highway viability as long as possible, but catastrophic failure could not be avoided."" Westby said the Transportation Department was ""decisively engaged on fixing the road and restoring connectivity to the Teton Valley."" In a study completed last January on the safety of the Teton Pass corridor, the Federal Highway Administration acknowledged that the highway ""offers a critical connection for commuters and recreationists traveling from Victor, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyoming."" The trip, from one end to the other, would ordinarily take around 30 minutes or so in a car, or slightly longer on public transit. Because of the steep mountain landscape, alternate routes send travelers on a lengthy detour that takes roughly three times as long and covers some 85 miles. The Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board said businesses in the city, as well as Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, would all remain open in a message shared on its website in the wake of the Teton Pass collapse. The board also recognized that closing the highway indefinitely will likely have consequences for workers living in Idaho and commuting to Teton County, who make up about 40% of the county's workforce, according to that message. ""Although businesses will do their best to support employees and commuters, and will work to remain open and maintain normal operating hours and services, it is expected that the workforce will be affected,"" the travel and tourism board said. ""As a community, we ask visitors and locals to exercise patience and understanding if you experience longer than normal wait times or interruptions in services.""

33,,Carlos Alcaraz beats Alexander Zverev to win first French Open title,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexander-zverev-carlos-alcaraz-french-open-final-roland-garros/,"The match marked the first time a men's final at Roland Garros didn't include at least one of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004.",2024-06-09T17:34:00Z,"

         Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest male tennis player to claim a major title on all three surfaces after beating Alexander Zverev in five sets at the French Open final on Sunday. Alcaraz won the first set 6-3 and Zverev took the second 6-2 to level the match. In the third set, Zverev edged out a 7-5 win before Alcaraz forced a fifth set with a dominant 6-1 win in the fourth set. He defeated Zverev 6-2 in the final decisive set. The 21-year-old Spaniard, who grew up watching countryman Rafael Nadal win trophy after trophy at Roland Garros — a record 14 in all — now has eclipsed Nadal to become the youngest man to collect major championships on three surfaces. Nadal was about 1½ years older when he did it. Alcaraz won the U.S. Open on hard courts in 2022 and Wimbledon on grass last year. ""You're already a Hall of Famer and you already achieved so much,"" Zverev said after the match. ""Not the last time you're going to win this."" Alcaraz is now 3-0 in Grand Slam finals. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and bowed out in the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. This time, Zverev lost after surging in front by reeling off the last five games of the third set. Alcaraz's level dipped during that stretch and he seemed distracted by a complaint over the condition of the clay at Court Philippe Chatrier, telling chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein it was ""unbelievable."" The match marked the first time a men's final at Roland Garros didn't include at least one of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004. Nadal lost to Zverev in the first round two weeks ago; Djokovic, a three-time champion, withdrew before the quarterfinals with a knee injury that required surgery; Federer is retired. This is breaking news. Check back for updates.

         Gunshots rang out at a Madison, Wisconsin apartment building on Sunday, leaving at least 10 people — including a teenager — injured, police said.  Officers were responding to a rooftop party at the Lux apartments around 12:45 a.m. when dispatch alerted them of a shooting, officials said. Dozens of people were trying to run from the building as they arrived. A teen with multiple gunshot wounds was bleeding in the street, Police Chief Shon Barnes said during a press conference, according to CBS News affiliate WISC.  ""Officers were notified that there were likely more victims in the building,"" Barnes said during the press conference. ""As a result, Madison police officers bravely ran up 12 flights of stairs to reach the rooftop, unaware of what they may encounter. They found some people in various stages of distress, and some were even hiding in a maintenance closet in an attempt to find safety."" He said it was a miracle that no one had died. The victims range in age from 14 to 23, officials said. Not all of the injuries were from gunshot wounds, but the local fire department said it had taken five victims with gunshot wounds to the hospital.  Some of the injured made their way to the hospital themselves. Police said none of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening. Police said the shooting appeared to be a targeted incident. Officers have not yet made any arrests. Officials also have not released a description of the shooter. Detectives are still talking with victims and witnesses and looking over digital evidence, authorities said.

          / CBS News
         On this ""Face the Nation"" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan:  Click here to browse full transcripts of ""Face the Nation.""    MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan.  And this week on Face the Nation: celebrations in Israel, as four hostages are rescued in a daring mission.  Plus, our new poll has some surprising findings from the presidential race here at home.  Tearful reunions after four hostages held by Hamas for eight months were finally returned to their families.  (Begin VT)  WOMAN: Thank you for bringing my son to me, to us.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: But the bold operation aided by U.S. intelligence came at a high cost of more than 200 Palestinian lives. And the prospect of a cease-fire in Gaza to allow the return of the more than 115 remaining hostages is still very unclear.  (Begin VT)  (CHANTING)  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Here at home, the pressure builds on President Biden to do more to end the bloody conflict that's also taking a political toll on his reelection.  National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will join us, as will the World Food Program's Cindy McCain with an update on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  Plus, a new CBS poll on what voters think of some of the more controversial policy plans of both candidates.  (Begin VT)  DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): I will stop the invasion, and we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham and President Biden confident Senator Chris Coons will both be here.  Finally, the message from D-Day and how it holds true today.  (Begin VT)  JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.  Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.  President Biden will be returning from his visit to France today, and it'll be a quick turnaround, as he will return to Italy for a Group of Seven meetings with America's top allies later this week.  At the top of the agenda for both trips, the two ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as how to handle aggression from the countries not represented at that meeting, Russia and China.  We spoke with President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, earlier today and began by asking him about the Israeli hostage rescue and whether military operations are the way to free the remaining that are still held captive.  (Begin VT)  JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): By far, the most effective, certain and right way to get all of the hostages out is to get a comprehensive cease-fire and hostage deal that President Biden described in public a few days ago, that Israel has accepted, and now that we are awaiting Hamas to respond to.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, I know the U.S. provided intelligence support to this military operation. Are you at all concerned that it will imperil the chances at that diplomatic agreement?  And – and is there an expiration date by which Yahya Sinwar has to respond to this offer? JAKE SULLIVAN: It's a fair question, Margaret. What will Hamas do in terms of its calculus on this deal following this operation? And I, of course, cannot put myself in the head of a Hamas terrorist.  But the fact is that the whole world is looking to Hamas to say yes, because, for all those people for all these months who have been calling for a cease-fire, now is the moment. There could be a cease-fire tomorrow, today, even, if Hamas would say yes to the deal.  So, from our perspective, the world needs to continue to reinforce that message quite clearly and strongly. We have not gotten an official respond yet – response yet from Hamas. We're waiting for one. We're waiting to hear from the Qataris and the Egyptians, who are the mediators in communication with them.  And we will continue to reinforce the message, take the deal, until we get that answer.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, I was looking back at remarks you made on this program just a week after that horrific attack on Israel on October 7, and, even in the early days, you were pressing the Israeli government for a clear plan on what they will do in Gaza the day after the war ends.  Has Netanyahu accepted any of the U.S. proposals or suggestions? Has he presented any of it to his own war cabinet?  JAKE SULLIVAN: We do have a detailed discussion with our Israeli counterparts about the day after.  But we also have been clear, as you said, from the very beginning, that a military strategy to defeat a terrorist group has got to be connected to a political and humanitarian strategy and a logical strategic endgame.  And too often over the course of this conflict, we have not seen that clear connection, and we have continued to reinforce the need for Israel to bear down, to ensure that it has a holistic strategy to ensure the enduring defeat of Hamas and to ensure a better day of peace and stability for Israelis and Palestinians alike.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like no – no agreement on that as yet.  President Biden gave an interview to ""TIME"" magazine that was published this past week, and he was asked whether he's seen evidence of Israeli war crimes in Gaza.  He said: ""The answer is, it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves."" He dismissed the idea Israel was starving people as part of its war strategy. But he also said: ""I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate."" What would you say is inappropriate?  JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, actually, Margaret, a couple of weeks ago, the State Department put out a comprehensive report that didn't just speak in generalities. It went into specific incidents that raised real concerns. And it made the statement in that report…  MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was inconclusive, which is what the secretary of state said on this program at that time.  JAKE SULLIVAN: Right. And it's exactly what the president said as well when he was asked the question.  We do not have enough information to reach definitive conclusions about particular incidents or to make legal determinations, but we do have enough information to have concern – more than concern. Our hearts break about the loss of innocent Palestinian life.  The president himself has said publicly that Palestinians, innocent Palestinians, are going through sheer hell in this conflict. And a lot of that is because Hamas has put them in an impossible situation. Hamas hides among the civilian population, holds hostages among the civilian population…  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  JAKE SULLIVAN: … fires at the IDF from behind the civilian population.  And so, yes, we have asked Israel to take steps to be more precise and targeted in its military operations. But there is only one answer to all of this. And it's the answer I keep coming back to, which is a cease-fire and hostage deal that would end the suffering, end the conflict, end the war, and bring all of the hostages home.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The president recently approved allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to fire across the Russian border, a restricted area, but still a new policy choice here.  Has that made a difference on the battlefield?  JAKE SULLIVAN: From the president's perspective, this was common sense.  What was happening up around Kharkiv, which was new just in the last couple of months, was a Russian offensive where they were moving from one side of the border directly to the other side of the border.  And it simply didn't make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at the Ukrainians. So, the president authorized that. The Ukrainians have carried out that authorization on the battlefield. And one thing I will point out is that the momentum of that operation in Kharkiv has stalled out. Now, Kharkiv is still under threat, but the Russians have not been able to make material progress on the ground in recent days in that area.  And the United States will continue to support Ukraine in holding the line and pushing back against the aggressing Russian forces.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, Vladimir Putin said in response to that he – that Russia has the option to arm Western adversaries in response.  One of your top aides here in Washington on Friday gave a pretty notable speech, Jake, in which he said, the U.S. may – may need to soon increase its stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons, given the expanding arsenals of America's adversaries.  Have you seen evidence that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are sharing nuclear technology at this point? And what would trigger President Biden to make that decision?  JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Margaret, I can't speak to intelligence matters, especially highly sensitive intelligence matters relative to nuclear capability.  But what I can say is that we are concerned. We are concerned about cooperation among the countries you just mentioned, and we are concerned about the advancing nuclear arsenals of countries like China and Russia, as well as North Korea.  This is something that we are focused on. We are looking hard at. And we will consult with our allies and partners on the best way forward to ensure a safe, reliable and credible nuclear deterrent by the United States. We've taken no decisions. We will monitor the situation closely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this because China has brushed off your attempts at arms control?  JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, actually, Margaret, in the last few months, China has showed a greater willingness, not a lower willingness, to engage with us on questions related to proliferation and arms control.  Those are nascent conversations. They're nothing like the kinds of intense arms control negotiations that we had with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War or Russia in the post-Cold War era. But it's the beginning of a dialogue.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, thank you very much for joining us from Paris.  JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me. (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our latest CBS News poll of the 2024 presidential race, and it shows the likely nominees effectively tied.  Among voters across all 50 states, Former President Trump leads President Biden by one point, 50 to 49. But if we're looking at voters across the seven states identified by CBS as the battlegrounds, likely to decide the election, those numbers are flipped, and President Biden is ahead of his predecessor by one point, 50 to 49.  Joining us now for some analysis is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.  Anthony, you have been telling us this is going to be a close race. Data supports that at this point. We're now 10 days past that Trump conviction in a New York courtroom. What have we learned?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: That that conviction matters some. The impact is limited, but it's there.  And here's why. First of all, context. Voters do not rate the trial as anywhere near as important as things like the economy and inflation, things where Donald Trump has advantages.  But we do see a little bit of activation there, especially among the Democratic base, of voters for Joe Biden, who are now more motivated by opposition to Donald Trump. Specifically, the number of Joe Biden voters who say that their primary reason for Joe – voting for Joe Biden is to oppose Donald Trump is up. And it's now a majority of his vote.  We have also seen folks among the Democratic base a little bit more motivated to turn out, kind of erasing some of that expressed turnout advantage that the Republicans had had in the battleground states and among a couple of key demographic groups, independent, et cetera, where Biden gets a little bit of traction there.  But, again, one of the reasons that this is limited is that then the Trump folks tell you they think the charges aren't serious. They think everything is political.  What it does do, though, is put a spotlight on the campaign to define what this campaign is about. And when you ask people, is this a judgment on Donald Trump for you, when that happens, Joe Biden wins those voters by 2- 1.  But when people say that this contest is about a comparison between the two or a referendum on Joe Biden, Donald Trump does much better. And part of the reason he does much better is that Trump does better than Biden on a lot of these qualities, like being tough, being effective.  Biden does better on being personally liked, on being compassionate. What does all that tell you, is that each of these campaigns is going to try, at least in part, to make this campaign about the other guy, as much as or at least – or more as what they're going to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, let's talk about some of the issues you say are important to voters. The border is one of them.  President Biden did issue an executive order this past week. It authorizes U.S. officials to deport large numbers of migrants without processing asylum claims until the border crossings number dips below 1,500. So it's essentially suspending some of the asylum processing.  Trump's been perceived as stronger on the border. Does this change anything?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: No, Trump still is. More people think that Donald Trump's policies would stop or slow border crossings more than Biden.  Having said that, there is widespread support when we test in general terms for what President Biden just did. He gets seven in 10 support on that. It's overwhelming among Republicans. It's also strong among Democrats.  Look, context there, people have said they think that the border is in crisis for a long time. Having said that, we have a lot of the campaign rhetoric, speaking of what people say they would do. You have seen the Trump campaign talking about mass deportations.  We tested that in a general way in principle. Would you support a new government program that would deport all people living in the U.S. illegally? And that finds majority favor. That finds six in 10. It's strongest among folks who are MAGA. It's strongest among Trump supporters, but also from some Democrats as well.  And I think that that speaks to the general idea, not just that people see the border as a crisis, but also where we are in the campaign, where a lot of very dramatic or, you know, new proposals out there are finding favor here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, unpack that a bit, because this 62 percent of Americans favor deporting all undocumented immigrants.  So, Homeland Security says that President Biden has already deported or repatriated more people in the past year than any year since 2010. And then, depending on the details of what's talked about on the campaign trail, some of what Mr. Trump talks about could be illegal. It doesn't seem practical, in some sense, to round up children.  And then we know that the courts have questioned whether local authorities would have the ability to do it, and federal authorities don't have the resources. So what exactly do people think they're supporting?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, when you measure public sentiment on this or really just about any policy, you're getting a sense of direction. You're getting broad brushstrokes. But those kinds of details, well, that's often up to the legislatures and the courts later on. We tested even the idea of, should local law enforcement be involved in this? And a lot of folks do say yes. Again, the details of that, the specifics, you're not going to pick that up in an aggregate public opinion.  MARGARET BRENNAN: They weren't tracking the Supreme Court decisions.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Undoubtedly not.  But, look, it does tell you, though, for the viewer watching this campaign, that what we're seeing here connects to whether it's the courts, the – what some people say is the politicization of the courts, these ideas of mass deportations, et cetera, we are in a different era, in which a lot of folks say the system as a whole is not working.  And all of these, if you connect the dots through them, are part of that reaction against it, which explains some of that general sentiment for some of these policies.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's really just kind of a: ""Do something.""  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Do something.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much for your analysis.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute, so stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He joins us from London.  Good morning to you, Senator.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were at those D-Day remembrances earlier in the week.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you met with President Zelenskyy as well. He has asked for more training for his forces…  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: … and for that to happen faster and inside of Ukraine. Do you support the U.S. doing that?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I do support us training inside the country.  You know, the delay in weapons because of House inaction, we did lose momentum. But from the very beginning, the Biden administration, they did not impose pre-invasion sanctions to deter Putin. They didn't give weapons to Ukraine early on to deter Putin.  And now we've got a chance to reset this war, that they have the weapons. Here's what he wanted most of all, for us to go after the Russian assets all over the world, take the money from the sovereign wealth funds of Russia and give it to Ukraine.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: There's $300 billion sitting in Europe from Russian sovereign wealth assets that we should seize and give to Ukraine. We have Russian money in America we should seize. We should make Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law.  When I suggested that to President Zelenskyy, he lit up like a Christmas tree.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Making Russia a state sponsor of U.S. – a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law would be a very big blow to Russia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I don't know that the Biden administration would sign off on that, though.  But in terms of what you just mentioned with…  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They won't.  (LAUGHTER)  MARGARET BRENNAN: … with the assets…  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … President Biden did say this morning he had reached an agreement with President Macron of France on the use of profits from those frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.  I know the Europeans haven't wanted to go ahead and seize assets, because it would hurt their banks.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.  Well, they – they want to use the interest to help people or – either we're going to help Ukraine, or we're not. It's now time to give them the F-16s, let them fly the planes, long-range artillery to hit targets inside of Russia. Go after Putin's assets wherever they're at all over the world. Go on the offensive.  I think, this summer, Ukraine will regain military momentum. Everything we've done with Ukraine has been slow. It's been indecisive.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: But if we went after the assets that Putin has all over the world, take his money that's stolen from the Russian people, and help the victims in Ukraine, I think it would do a lot to end this war.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Your Republican colleague Senator Tommy Tuberville just this past week said on Steve Bannon's show that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a dictator and unconstitutional.  And he said this about Vladimir Putin:  (Begin VT)  SENATOR TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-Alabama): He doesn't want Ukraine. He doesn't want Europe. Hell, he – he's got enough land of his own. He just wants to make sure that he does not have United States' weapons in Ukraine pointing at Moscow.  (End VT)  (LAUGHTER)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Those echo some Russian talking points.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I – I wonder if those remarks from your fellow senator represent the GOP? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, it represents him, and him alone.  If you spent 15 minutes studying Putin and what he wants, he wants to re – recreate the Russian empire. He's not going to stop in Ukraine.  We celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day. It was a failure. It was the unnecessary war, described by Winston Churchill. We had a dozen chances to stop Hitler.  It's not about NATO. It's not about American weapons in Ukraine. It's about a megalomaniac wanting to create the Russian empire by force of arms. If you don't stop him, there goes Taiwan.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So we've been slow as hell of helping Ukraine, but Senator Tuberville's analysis really misses what Putin's all about. He's an outlier, I think, in the Republican Party.  I like him personally. But what did Trump do to get the weapons flowing? He created a loan system. They're sitting on $10 trillion to $12 trillion of critical minerals in – in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe.  I don't want to give that money and those assets to Putin to share with China. If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of. That $10 trillion to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets…  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: … could be used by Ukraine and the West, not given to Putin and China.  This is a very big deal, how Ukraine ends.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Let's help them win a war we can't afford to lose. Let's find a solution to this war.  But they're sitting on a gold mine. To give Putin $10 trillion or $12 trillion for critical minerals…  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: … that he will share with China is ridiculous. MARGARET BRENNAN: I – I want to get to the Middle East with you as well.  Later today, Benny Gantz, one of the ministers in Prime Minister Netanyahu's war cabinet, is expected to announce his resignation, which he has previously said would happen if he wasn't handed a day-after plan.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The defense minister has also said there is no planning for the day after happening. Where is this headed?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think Mr. Gantz will withdraw from the war cabinet, but Bibi will still have a majority.  I like Benny Gantz. Here's what I found on my last trip to Israel just a few days ago. There's universal opposition to creating a Palestinian state by all levels of Israeli society if it is seen as a reward for terrorism of October the 7th.  The day-after plan, when Hamas is destroyed militarily, and they no longer can threaten Israel, needs to be a negotiation between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the UAE to come up with a plan for Gaza and the West Bank, to give some – to give the Palestinians hope and a better life and secure Israel.  That is the only plan I see working. You cannot occupy – Israel can't, in my view – permanently Gaza. That will be a disaster for Israel.  So, the hope for the day after…  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu hasn't said that clearly yet, that he would not seek to occupy…  (CROSSTALK)  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I just – he's coming – he's coming July the 24th.  I have spent a lot of time with Bibi. He is right to want to make sure there will be no stop to this war until Hamas is destroyed militarily and cannot threaten another October 7. I have had very detailed discussions with the – with the prime minister and with the crown prince and this administration. I believe…  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you…  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: … there will be forming in the next – wait. OK. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you more about this.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: But there will be a plan coming about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we have to talk more about this on the other side of the commercial break, though.  So just give me a minute or two, and we'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will have more findings from our latest CBS News poll on the 2024 presidential race tomorrow on American Decides, a daily show on our streaming network that airs at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.  Face the Nation will be back in a minute.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Chris Coons, and head of the World Food Program Cindy McCain.  Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  We return to our conversation now with South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.  Senator, thank you for staying through the break for us.  Before we went to it you said, by July 24th, when the prime minister of Israel is here in Washington to address a joint session of Congress, you do expect a plan for the day after. Do you expect, given the limited amount of time left, that there will be normalization with Saudi Arabia and Congress will be able to vote before the election?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it's still possible. But the administration's taken months to negotiate the defense agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States, holding it over the - Israel's head regarding Rafah. I think we're almost there.  One thing I got from this trip was that they still don't have the weapons they need in Israel to finish off Hamas. So, they're going to be sending me a list of weapons that are being slow walked. So, I'm going to bring that up. But, yes, I think we can still do this. July the 24th will be here before you know it. Hopefully major military operations will be over against Hamas if we give Israel the weapons they need. And we can sit down and talk about a vision for Gaza and the West Bank that will give security to Israel, hope and prosperity for the Palestinian people with Saudi Arabia and the UAE involved.  So, that is my hope. That is my belief. And I want to help where I can.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see if that vote can be taken.  But, sir, you just mentioned U.S. military aid. Our poll out today shows a majority of Americans, 61 percent, say the U.S. should not send Israel weapons. Six in 10 says Israel should stop or decrease its military actions in Gaza.  Isn't it time for this war to end now given that the tide of public opinion is turning against Israel?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it would be the - the biggest mistake we could - I've criticized Senator Tuberville for his view of Ukraine. Let me be straight with you, Hamas would kill everybody here if they could get here. Israel is not our enemy. They're our ally.  MARGARET BRENNAN: They can.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, they can't because they're pinned down over there. I want them destroyed so they can never come back to hurt Israel or us. Hezbollah is alive and well. So, to those Americans who believe pulling the plug on Israel now makes us safer, you've missed a lot.  Radical Islam wants to slit the throat of every Jewish person. And your throat too. So, no, I want to give weapons they need. The administration's withholding weapons. The - Trump was a great ally of Israel. If he wins this - this election, he'll have a - another great ally.  I appreciate what President Biden's doing, but it's all been so slow. So, if you don't - Iran, here's the big take away from my trip. The IDF chief told me he's never been more worried about a nuclear breakout regarding the Iranians than he is right now. He thinks we've lost deterrence. He's asking for joint military operations with the United States to convince Iran not to dash towards a nuclear weapon. These are the most dangerous times since the '30s. Don't make the mistakes of the '30s. Senator Tuberville said, give Putin what he wants.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's what we did in the '30s. That didn't work out. Pull the plug on Israel. That didn't work in World War II. It's not going to work now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, in this past year the Biden administration deported, expelled or repatriated more than 740,000 people, which they say is more than any year since 2010. You, this week, said there need to be mass deportations.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, there will be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't those numbers mass deportations?  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They've had 10 million people come into this country illegally. It's the highest level of illegal immigration in the last three years, in the history of the country. We went from the lowest under Trump to the highest in recorded history. They're never going to stop coming until they see people leaving.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Due to Covid.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: On day one - on day one, President Trump will deport people here illegally by the tens of thousands. Then, and only then, will this stop. And Biden will never do that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you also know that Congress would have to provide the resources to do that to immigrations and customers enforcement, and they say they don't have the manpower or the money to do any of that, at that scale.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, if - if Trump is president - if Trump is president -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: His top priority will be to sealed that border, deport here people illegally. We're living on borrowed time when it comes to another 9/11.  If you're looking for somebody to fix a broken border and keep us safe, Donald Trump, I believe, is your best case.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And if you don't believe that after the last three years, you've made - you're making a big mistake.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, joining us from London today. Thank you for your time, sir.  We turn now to Delaware. Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He is the national co-chairman of President Biden's re-election campaign. And he joins us this morning from his home state. Senator, let's - let's pick up on the border since we just left that there.  This new order the president just implemented this past week authorizes immigration officials to deport large numbers of migrants without processing their asylum claims.  You were critical when Donald Trump used this 212(f) authority under his administration. Why do you support President Biden's use of it?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Because there's a stark difference in the values that President Biden and former President Trump bring to trying to address the issue of border security and immigration.  I'll remind you, Margaret, that former President Trump tried to implement a Muslim ban. A ban on entry to this country explicitly based on one religion. He also used cruelty. The forceful separation of parents from their children and the caging of children at our border to try and deter folks from coming to seek asylum or to seek refuge in our country.  President Biden has time and time again asked Congress to enact a broad solution to our border security and immigration challenges.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: And after months of negotiation between Senators Langford, Sinema and Murphy, we were one day away from putting on the floor of the Senate that bipartisan solution. Former President Trump intervened to stop it because former President Trump actually wants a problem to solve through his election -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Rather than a solution that a bipartisan group of senators stood behind.  President Biden is moving ahead with forceful leadership at securing our border. President Trump is simply making a political issue of this.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we should say you are co-chair of the Biden campaign, Senator, but we did cover that border debate and the bill in depth on this program. But - but on the premise itself of the authority being used, there is a lot of approval in our polling of what the president just did, but it looks, frankly, like they're just trying to get caught trying since the administration admits the courts likely will halt this. The ACLU says they're going to sue over it. Asylum is a human right under international law.  What do you think this is signaling to - to Biden supporters, particularly in the progressive left of your party? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I think it's signaling that President Biden is determined to address issues that are of very broad concern to the vast majority of Americans. He would prefer that it be done by legislation.  As you just pointed out, legislation that could provide the resources, the judges, the processing, the immigration funding that would make for a more balanced, humane and sustainable solution to our border crisis.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I'll remind you, former President Trump tried to use gimmicks like building a border wall and is now threatening to nationalize the - the - to federalize the National Guard and use it to deport tens of millions of people already here in the United States.  The difference between Trump's approach and Biden's approach is one of cruelty versus effectiveness.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So only - in our polling, only about 20 percent believe President Biden's policies would decrease the number of migrants. Are you worried that it's just simply too late? I mean we've been talking about process in Congress. We've been talking about this executive order for months now and the trigger was just pulled this week. Is it too late?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: No, I don't think it is because, frankly, I think the American people understand the difference between substance and showmanship. President Biden, every year in his State of the Union, has asked for bipartisan initiatives to address the border and to address immigration. And there's one party, the Republican Party, that time and time again has rejected bipartisan solutions to immigration and the border.  And, frankly, what I also hear, as I've campaigned across our country for our president -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Is grave concern about the commitment to reproductive rights, to fundamental freedoms by the current MAGA Republican majority and by former President Trump.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: He is bragging that he nominated to the Supreme Court three justices who reversed Roe versus Wade and who have now put contraception at risk. That's why we took a vote in the Senate last week, Margaret -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: To make it clear that Democrats will protect fundamental rights, where Republicans, under the leadership of former President Trump, are putting them at real risk.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Middle East.  You described Prime Minister Netanyahu's last address to a joint session of Congress in 2015 as a political rally against then President Obama.  We're in this election year. There has been tension between our two leaders. Do you expect the prime minister to have an election rally against President Biden?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Boy, I sure hope not. But Prime Minister Netanyahu has a long record of being very partisan and very divisive. For decades, Margaret, the strong bipartisan support for Israel, for its security, has been a hallmark of our close alliance.  But I'll remind you, Prime Minister Netanyahu isn't just divisive here, he's divisive at home.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: For months and months before the October 7th attacks, the largest protests in Israeli history were occurring week after week in the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem against steps that Prime Minister Netanyahu was taking, putting at risk of rule of law. And Benny Gantz, a centrist, decorated IDF war hero, will likely today announce that he is leaving Netanyahu's war cabinet because there's no clear plan for the path forward.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Our president, Joe Biden, has been leading a strong effort to try and secure a hostage release and a cease-fire. It's been embraced by all of our close allies in the G-7. And it's my hope that that can still be accomplished.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: But, frankly, if Netanyahu isn't coming to speak to Congress about his plan for securing peace, his plan for the path forward, I don't know why we would go.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So - so why would the Democratic leader in the Senate agree to something that could potentially be so damaging to the president?  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Senator Schumer has publicly said that it was with some reluctance, some concern about how Prime Minister Netanyahu has this past practice of using an address to Congress to be divisive. He has a chance to help rebuild and secure bipartisan support for Israel. He has a chance to present a positive path forward towards peace. Look, I respect how hard Lindsey Graham, Senator Graham, has worked to try and bring together Saudi normalization with Israel in exchange for Palestinian self-governance.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: That's an important effort many of us have been involved in.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has a chance to show that he will be a real leader, not just a partisan leader, but someone who will try and secure peace and stability for Israel. It's my hope that that's what will happen and that that's why Senator Schumer agreed to invite him to speak to a joint session of Congress.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Coons, thank you for joining us today.  SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme Cindy McCain.  Good to have you here in person.  CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme: Thank you. Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, overnight we learned that that U.S. pier off of Gaza that set - was set up by the military has reopened. It had stopped functioning for a bit.  How is it going? Because I know you are helping to oversee distribution.  CINDY MCCAIN: Well, right now we're paused because I'm concerned about the safety of our people after the incidents yesterday. We also - two of our warehouses - warehouse complexes were rocketed yesterday. So we've stepped back just for the moment to - to make sure that we're in - in - on safe terms and on safe ground before I'll - before we'll - we'll restart. But the rest of the country is operational. We're doing - we're doing everything we can in the north and the south.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How did your locations get rocketed? I imagine you do deconflict and share your locations with the Israeli military. CINDY MCCAIN: We are deconflicted. I don't know. That's a good - it's a good question.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you lose any of your workers?  CINDY MCCAIN: We had one man injured. But everything else is fine. Everybody - no - there's nobody else hurt.  But, indeed, it's - it's a kind of thing, that's why a cease-fire is necessary. That's why we need to stop this so that we can get in at scale with our aid and other - and other aid from other organizations as well.  We can't continue this in a - in a way because what almost happened in the north with famine could happen in the south. And so that's what we're trying to - to - to avoid right now. And it's been very difficult just because of the - of what's going on. You know, the - we've had looting inside the country. We've had, you know, various problems around with the - you know, there's always something going on. It's very difficult to operate there.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned just now the full blown famine in the north. When you said that it got a lot of attention.  Prime Minister Netanyahu was asked about your comments by NBC and said, quote, ""Cindy McCain, unfortunately, is misinformed."" The Israeli government's been putting out pictures of food being brought into Gaza. They dispute there is famine.  How does that square with what you are seeing on the ground?  CINDY MCCAIN: When - when I made that comment, my people had seen it on the ground, not only evidence of it, but the actual impact of it. Since then they've allowed us to get more trucks into the north. And so we're getting much more food in - in up there and that will stave it off.  But - but, listen, the bottom line here is, is I make choices every day to take food from the hungry to give to the starving. We need a ceasefire, and we need it now so that we can feed - and this doesn't happen in the south. We're right on the edge in the south of the same thing occurring.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the edge of famine in the south of Gaza?  CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, there's - there's people that are very hungry and can't - don't have access because of the danger, or because of - because they've been pushed, you know, into the center again. So, we want to make sure that we can - can not just get in and feed, but do it at scale.  They need more than food, too. It's water. It's sanitation. It's medicine. So, it's all of the above, because famine is not just about starving, it's about all the other things, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know how difficult I've heard it is to help a child with stunted growth.  CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said you're - you're taking from the hungry to feed the starving. You are dealing with a lot in Sudan as well.  CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States said paramilitary forces murdered 100 people this past week, including children. And I know the Biden administration says the world's not paying enough attention to Sudan.  What's happening? And are they already at famine?  CINDY MCCAIN: Well, Sudan has the real possibility of becoming the world's largest humanitarian crisis. We cannot get food in. We can barely get food in. We certainly aren't getting it in at scale. And you see the results of what can happen if people aren't fed.  We're also coming into the lean season, which makes it very difficult many times for our trucks to even operate, if they can get in. We need - we need more - in Sangeral (ph) we need more crossings, we need safe and unfettered access. And that's the same for Gaza, by the way, safe and unfettered access, and making sure that keep - that we can get in and make sure we can feed at scale.  Once again it's about the agreements from various people and various factions and all of this. Bottom line is, people are going to starve to death unless we can get in there.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We've been talking all week long about America's role in the world. And the U.S. is still the largest donor to the World Food Programme.  CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were here last June and we spoke, you said you were trying to encourage China to get involved with funding, but also get their expertise with technology and agriculture.  Are they stepping up at all? Are other countries stepping up?  CINDY MCCAIN: Other countries are stepping up. You know, it's not to the scale that it was two years ago, but it - but countries have stepped up. And - and in the case of Sudan, a few more have stepped up to it. Sudan is a forgotten crisis and its implication's being a destabilizing factor in that region can have catastrophic effects as it comes down the - comes down the line. So it's really imperative that we get the - the crossings open and we have safe access, that the - the factions - the various factions understand that we are - you know, we're humanitarian and we need to have the access.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And to your point, U.S. intelligence has said that if this isn't acted upon, that it can contribute to the growth of terrorism.  CINDY MCCAIN: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Just like in Gaza.  CINDY MCCAIN: People - people will do anything to feed their families. And if it comes down to it, terrorism may be the choice they have to make.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Cindy McCain, thank you for sharing with us your (INAUDIBLE).  CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you. Thanks for covering it. Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden this morning ended his trip to France by laying a wreath at a cemetery just outside of Paris where American soldiers and marines were buried in World War I. Shortly after, he explained why the trip was necessary.  (BEGIN VC)  JOE BIDEN (President Of The United States): The idea that I come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute, and it's the same story. Think about it. America showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans. And America shows up when we're needed. Just like our allies show up for us.  (END VC)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Earlier this week the president marked 80 years since the D-day invasion that helped begin the liberation of Europe from Nazi control and touted American leadership and democracy on the world stage. It inspired us to look at some of the lessons of our past.  (BEGIN VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Twenty years after the victory at Normandy, Walter Cronkite returned there with Dwight Eisenhower.  DWIGHT EISENHOWER, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You see that high ground right above there?  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): The former president reflected on his decision as supreme allied commander to storm the beaches and liberate Europe from Nazi Germany.  DWIGHT EISENHOWER: I devoutly hope that we will never again have to see such scenes as these. But these people gave us a chance, and they bought time for us so that we could do better than we had before.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): This week President Biden, a small child in 1944, praised the few surviving veterans whose bravery he said we need to summon again.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (President Of The United States): We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed in 1944.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): The tyrant bent on domination now, he said, is Vladimir Putin, whose soldiers have taken Ukrainians from their homes away to filtration camps, abducted Ukrainian children and sent invading forces to ravage Ukraine. Putin's access of allies includes rising power China, North Korea, and Iran.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If the autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine, to see if we let this illegal aggression go unchecked.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Biden wasn't the only one hearing echoes of the past.  MELVIN HURWITZ (World War II Veteran): Oh, you're the savior of the people. (INAUDIBLE) my eyes.  VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): Oh, no, no, you - you saved Europe.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Ninety-nine-year-old D-day vet Melvin Hurwitz called President Zelenskyy a hero.  Former President Donald Trump has a very different opinion of Zelenskyy, and Trump argues the largest invasion of history is underway now at the U.S. southern border. This past week he said our worst enemy is within America. DONALD TRUMP (Former U.S. President): I say we have the enemy in from within and we have the enemy from the outside. And I'm telling you, we are in more danger from the enemy from within with these lunatics, these fascists, these communists. And we're going to stop that also.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Past presidents have also gone to Normandy and called on weary Americans to remember that deterring conflict today costs less than fighting it tomorrow.  RONALD REAGAN (Former U.S. President) (1984): We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with expansionist intent.  MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): The ascendant far right forces in Europe riding the wave of a backlash against migration there and a surge in anti- Semitism reflect another strain on the international system. Similar divides here at home raise questions about whether we've forgotten that ignoring hate or appeasing authoritarians can come with an unimaginably high cost. One paid 80 years ago by these troops who, as Eisenhower said, bought time for us so that we can do better than we have before.  (END VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN (on camera): We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)

         The following is a transcript of an interview with Cindy McCain, World Food Programme executive director, on ""Face the Nation"" that aired on June 9, 2024. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, good to have you here in person.  U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now overnight, we learned that that U.S. pier off of Gaza that was set up by the military has reopened. It had stopped functioning for a bit. How is it going? Because I know you are helping to oversee distribution. MCCAIN: Well, right now we're paused because I'm concerned about the safety of our people after the incidents yesterday. We also- two of our warehouses- warehouse complex, were rocketed yesterday, so we've stepped back just for the moment to make sure that we're in- on safe terms and on safe ground before, before we'll restart. But the rest of the country is operational. We're doing- we're doing everything we can in the north and the south.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How did your locations get rocketed? I imagine you do de-conflict and share your locations with the Israeli military.  MCCAIN: We are de conflicted. I don't know. That's a- it's a good question.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you lose any of your–  MCCAIN: We had one man injured, but everything else is fine. Nobody else is hurt. But indeed, it's- it's the kind of thing that's why a ceasefire is necessary. That's why we need to stop this so that we can get in at scale with our aid and other and other aid from other organizations as well. We can't continue this in a way, because what almost happened in the north with famine  could happen in the south. And so that's what we're trying to avoid right now. And it's been very difficult, just because of the- of what's going on. You know, we've had looting inside the country, we've had, you know, various problems around with it. You know, there's always something going on. It's very difficult to operate there.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned just now the full blown famine in the north. When you said that, it got a lot of attention. Prime Minister Netanyahu was asked about your comments by NBC and said quote ""Cindy McCain, unfortunately, is misinformed."" The Israeli government's been putting out pictures of food being brought into Gaza. They dispute there is famine. How does that square with what you are seeing on the ground? MCCAIN: When I made that comment, my people had seen it on the ground, not only evidence of it, but the actual impact of it. Since then, they've allowed us to get more trucks into the north, and so we're getting much more food in- in up there, and that will stave it off, but- but listen, the bottom line here is- is I make choices every day to take food from the hungry to give to the starving. We need a ceasefire, we need it now so we can feed and this doesn't happen in the south. We're right on the edge in the south of the same thing occurring.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the edge of famine in the south of Gaza?  MCCAIN: Yes. There's- there's people that are very hungry and can't- don't have access because of the danger, because of- because they've been pushed, you know, into the center again. So we want to make sure that we can- can not just get in and feed, but do it at scale. They need more than food, too. It's water, it's sanitation, it's medicine, so it's all of the above, because famine is not just about starving, it's about all the other things too. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know how difficult I've heard it is to help a child with stunted growth. You just said you're- you're taking from the hungry to feed the starving. You are dealing with a lot in Sudan as well.  MCCAIN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States said paramilitary forcers- forces murdered 100 people this past week, including children. And I know the Biden administration says the world's not paying enough attention to Sudan. What's happening and are they already at famine? MCCAIN: Well, Sudan has the real possibility of becoming the world's largest humanitarian crisis. We cannot get food in, we can barely get food in, we certainly aren't getting it in at scale, and you see the results of what can happen if people aren't fed. We're also coming into the lean season, which makes it very difficult many times for our trucks to even operate if they can get in. We need- we need more- same drill- we need more crossings. We need safe and unfettered access. And that's the same for Gaza, by the way, safe and unfettered access and making sure that- we that we can get in and make sure we can feed at scale. Once again, it's about the agreements from various people and various factions and all of this. Bottom line is people are going to starve to death unless we get in there.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We've been talking all week long about America's role in the world, and the U.S. is still the largest donor to the World Food Programme. When you were here last June and we spoke, you said you were trying to encourage China to get involved with funding, but also get their expertise with technology and agriculture. Are they stepping up at all? Are other countries stepping up? MCCAIN: Other countries are stepping up. You know, it's not to the scale that it was two years ago, but it- but countries have stepped up, and in the case of Sudan, a few more have stepped up to it. Sudan is a forgotten crisis, and its implications being a destabilizing factor in that region, can have catastrophic effects as it comes down- comes down the line. So it's really imperative that we get the crossings open, that we have safe access, that the- factions, the various factions, understand that we are, you know, we're humanitarian, and we need to have the access. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to your point U.S. intelligence has said that if this isn't acted upon, that it can contribute to the growth of terrorism– MCCAIN: Absolutely– MARGARET BRENNAN: –just like in Gaza. MCCAIN: –people, people will do anything to feed their families, and if it comes down to it, terrorism may be the choice they have to make. MARGARET BRENNAN: Cindy McCain, thank you for sharing with us. MCCAIN: Thank you, thanks for good work.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.

         People across four states have fallen ill after eating Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing chocolate bars, the Food and Drug Administration warned.  The victims reported a variety of severe symptoms, including seizures, central nervous system depression, agitation, abnormal heart rates, hyper/hypotension, nausea and vomiting, the agency said Friday. Six of the eight victims needed to be hospitalized after eating the chocolate, which is sold nationwide. The full list of retailers selling the chocolate bars is unknown, the FDA said. The FDA said it is working to determine the cause of the illnesses. According to the company's website, the chocolate bars are made with a ""primo proprietary blend of nootropic and functional mushrooms."" The FDA warned against eating any flavors of Diamond Shruumz microdosing chocolate bars. The agency noted that the product, which can be bought online and at retail locations, may appeal to kids and teens because it's marketed as a candy. The FDA in 2022 described nootropics as ""a term widely used to market unapproved products as 'smart drugs' and 'cognitive enhancers.'"" ""Parents and caregivers should consider discussing the information in this advisory with their children and take extra care to avoid this product being consumed by younger people,"" the FDA wrote on Friday.  The last reported case was on June 3. Two of the victims were sickened in Indiana, while one person fell ill in Nevada and another was sickened in Pennsylvania, the FDA said. Four of the victims were in Arizona. Some victims had to be intubated, according to a release from the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center in Arizona.  ""While these products claim to contain only natural ingredients and no scheduled drugs, there is clearly something toxic occurring,"" Steve Dudley, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center, said in the Banner news release. ""We've seen the same phenomenon of people eating the chocolate bar then seizing, losing consciousness, and having to be intubated."" CBS has reached out to Diamond Shruumz for comment.  Aliza Chasan is a Digital Content Producer for ""60 Minutes"" and CBSNews.com.

         SACRAMENTO – An inmate who died in custody at the Sacramento County Main Jail early Saturday morning has been identified by his attorney as Smiley Martin, one of three suspects charged in the 2022 Sacramento mass shooting which left six people dead and 12 wounded.  The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office reports that at around 2:15 a.m., deputies did a cell check in the 5-East 300 Pod and saw an inmate was unresponsive. Deputies went in and started first aid, and jail medical staff also responded.  Sacramento Fire Department crews took over life-saving efforts, but the sheriff's office says the inmate was pronounced dead at the jail.  Norman Dawson, Martin's attorney, confirmed that it was his client who died.  ""The Public Defender, Amanda Benson, and I have been in contact with Jail Command. They are conducting their investigation. They will likely not provide any details until they have concluded that process,"" Dawson said in a statement. ""It is most tragic that Mr. Martin passed away, fighting to defend his innocence in the preliminary hearing process."" The sheriff's office did not release Martin's name but noted that the inmate had been in custody since April 20, 2022. An exact cause of death is now under investigation by the Sacramento County Coroner's Office.  Martin was one of three suspects accused in the Sacramento mass shooting in the late night hours of April 2, 2022, that left six people dead. The brazen gun battle in the heart of Sacramento's downtown corridor also left another dozen people wounded in what authorities had described as a gang fight between ""multiple rivals.""   Martin, along his brother Dandrae Martin and a third man, Mtula Payton, were all charged with murder in the shooting. All three are previously convicted felons.  Court proceedings in the case have been ongoing. The three suspects were last in court on Feb. 23 for a preliminary hearing.  Just weeks before the shooting, Sacramento County had agreed to pay Martin $7,500 in a settlement surrounding a 2018 lawsuit where he claimed that a jail guard was responsible for rival gang members attacking him. Cecilio Padilla is a digital producer for CBS Sacramento and a Sacramento-area native who has been covering Northern California for more than a decade.

         Former President Donald Trump's pre-sentencing interview with the New York probation office took place virtually on Monday, a source familiar with the proceedings confirmed.  After becoming the first former president in American history convicted in a criminal trial, Trump on Monday encountered another first: an interview with a probation officer. ""Earlier today, President Trump completed a routine interview with New York Probation Office,"" the source said. ""The interview was uneventful and lasted less than thirty minutes.""  For those who are convicted of crimes in Manhattan, the interviews are typically conducted in-person, in the same building where Trump's trial was held. Those being interviewed are not always accompanied by their lawyers. But Trump is no ordinary guilty party. The judge in his case, Juan Merchan, issued an order Friday granting Trump attorney Todd Blanche permission to attend the interview. It was conducted Monday, remotely via video, according to a source with knowledge of the scheduling. Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, while his probation officer was in an office at Manhattan Criminal Court. The report compiled by the probation officer included information about Trump's crimes, his personal history and criminal record. A unanimous jury found Trump guilty on May 30 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a scheme to cover up reimbursements for a ""hush money"" payment to an adult film star in 2016, part of an effort to prevent voters that year from hearing her story. Trump has continued to deny the allegations, and vowed to appeal the conviction. The judge has wide leeway in sentencing and can pose a prison term of up to four years for each count, but can also impose a sentence that includes no incarceration at all: such as probation or house arrest.  The report normally includes a recommendation for sentencing, as well as information from the defendant and his attorney designed to persuade the judge toward leniency. Trump will be sentenced next month, on July 11. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has not said if his office will seek jail time in its own filing to the court. Olivia Rinaldi contributed to this report.

         Video of a giraffe grabbing a toddler from the back of a pickup truck at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas went viral this week, and now the park is making changes to its rules to prevent incidents like this. Jason Toten said his 2-year-old, Paisley, was in the back of his pickup with her mom feeding the animals along the drive-thru wildlife park. When they stopped to feed a giraffe, the animal grabbed Paisley by her shirt and lifted her feet in the air, before dropping her back down.  ""My heart stopped, my stomach dropped … it scared me,"" Toten said. The people in the car behind them caught the scary moment on video. CBS News has also recently obtained video from Toten's wife, who caught the incident from her point of view. Toten said it was just an accident – the giraffe was grabbing for food and accidentally latched on to his daughter. He also said they followed all park rules, which include keeping car doors closed, feeding animals with cups — not your hands — and keeping 50 feet away from gates. The park, however, said they are changing their rules, effective immediately.  ""We were recently made aware of an incident involving one of our giraffes that occurred this past weekend,"" a representative for Fossil Rim told CBS News via email. ""The incident was first reported to us on Monday June 3rd. The safety of our guests and animals is always of utmost importance to us."" The park has never experienced anything like this previously, and they want to ensure it doesn't happen again. ""Effective immediately Fossil Rim will no longer be allowing guests to ride through the park in truck beds,"" the representative said. ""Fossil Rim offers a variety of experiences guided by knowledgeable staff so guests can continue to have up-close and memorable animal encounters, and support our mission to save threatened and endangered species."" The incident didn't deter the family — Toten said they'd visit again. And Paisley got a stuffed giraffe from the souvenir shop after the rough ride.

         More than one-third of U.S. counties lack care for pregnant women, according to March of Dimes. To help bridge the gap, the nonprofit has rolled out mobile units with ultrasound capabilities in cities lacking care. Certified nurse midwife Billie Hamilton-Powell runs the mobile office in the Washington D.C. and Maryland region, reaching women who might otherwise go without care. ""During pregnancy, it's important to go to the doctor; they'll be able to check for abnormalities,"" said Jennifer Eleribe, who currently doesn't have insurance. Eleribe worried about finding prenatal care until her colleague told her about the service. March of Dimes helped launch the Mobile Health Centers with providers in local communities, targeting the geographic regions that need the support. Currently, there are units in Columbus, Ohio, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Washington, D.C., and New York. Houston is expected to launch a unit later this year. ""We know women who don't get prenatal care are three to four times more likely to die,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, president and CEO of March of Dimes. Cherot says the care can be lifesaving in the areas considered maternity care deserts, lacking a hospital or birth center that offers obstetric care or providers. In these maternity care deserts, more than 2 million women are living with no access to prenatal care or obstetricians, according to the March of Dimes. Millions more live in areas where medical support is extremely limited, the organization estimates.  ""In rural South Dakota you're driving 150 miles, can you imagine for one prenatal visit?"" Cherot said. Urban settings are also affected, such as Prince George's County, Maryland, just outside of D.C. ""If a mom gets prenatal care, I can save her from having problems with her diabetes, hypertension, preterm labor,"" said Hamilton-Powell, who is also director of midwifery and mobile health services at University of Maryland Capital Region Health Medical Group. Hamilton-Powell serves women who are uninsured or underinsured, and she says it saves the patients and the hospitals in the long run since the health outcomes of her patients have improved. ""I don't want a woman to worry about am I going to pay my rent, or am I going to pay my deductible or not get my prenatal care,"" she said. ""This is going to solve that problem."" This isn't the only type of mobile care popping up. Last year, CBS chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook reported on groundbreaking mobile stroke units that helped get treatment to patients over half an hour quicker than traditional emergency medical methods. And earlier this year, in an effort to address prostate cancer rates, mobile units in New York brought free screenings to communities who need it most.  Called the Mount Sinai Robert F. Smith Mobile Prostate Cancer Screening Unit, blood tests are done right on the mobile unit with results in 23 minutes. Follow-up exams can also be done on the bus.

         Collville-sur-Mer, Normandy, France — The word ""hero"" is overused. But if not for the courage of the few remaining D-Day survivors and their friends who fell as they launched the fight to oust Adolf Hitler's Nazi German forces from France 80 years ago, there would have been no celebrations this week in Normandy. With each passing year, living testimony of the hell those Allied forces endured in the name of freedom is fading. ""We cannot allow what happened here to be lost in the years that come,"" President Biden said Thursday at a D-Day memorial event in the Normandy American Cemetery, where more than 9,300 fallen U.S. troops are buried. Command Sergeant Major Henry C. Armstrong, was among the D-Day veterans honored this week. He's 99 years old now, but the last time he was here, he landed off-shore on a barge as a young corporal in the U.S. Army, and he had to fight his way off the beach under relentless German fire. ""We were fighting all the way in,"" he said. ""I don't know how far in we got and how far down we got, but, it was late in the afternoon."" ""That night we were trying to get some sleep… A shell went off over our heads and it lit up like daylight,"" he recalled to CBS News. ""You've got to figure, I was 19 at the time, and a lot of the guys were that age, and we were scared to death — kids, of course."" But for the sake of the men serving under him, Armstrong said he put on a brave face. ""You have to do it that way. You have to. You have to realize that these men depend on you, you know?"" he said, adding: ""It's not that I was any different than them or anything else, you know, it was just that, we worked together as a team."" Military service runs in the family. Armstrong was accompanied for Thursday's memorial ceremonies by his great-grandson, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Tanner Armstrong, who's still on active duty.  Having served in Iraq and Afghanistan the younger Armstrong is no stranger to combat, but asked if he could imagine what his great-grandfather went through as he landed on Omaha Beach 80 years ago, he didn't hesitate: ""I absolutely cannot,"" he said. ""There was, who knows how many ships out here… The amount of manpower they used just in this area — it's unbelievable, and probably won't be matched again."" The elder Armstrong and his men went on to liberate Paris, and then they marched into Germany. He helped liberate a concentration camp and witnessed atrocities too brutal to detail here. Armstrong spent 41 years in the U.S. military. He served through the rest of WWII, the Korean War and then Vietnam. His life has been lived in service of his country. ""We love him to death,"" his great-grandson told CBS News. ""We're so proud of him."" Armstrong said it was wonderful to be able to return to Normandy 80 years later and that, ""in a sense, it's a good memory — but then in a sense, it's a sad memory."" He said it was painful to ""realize when I came ashore, a lot of the others came ashore - a lot of the others didn't make it."" Armstrong said he would never forget those men who couldn't make it off Omaha Beach, and never forget what happened here. Neither can we.

         Johannesburg — The United Nations confirmed late Thursday that 35 children were among those killed in one of the deadliest attacks to date in the civil war that has torn Sudan apart for more than a year. Eyewitnesses said the brutal attack left up to 200 people dead in the village of Wad Al-Noora, in Sudan's central Gezira state. Sudan's army vowed a strong response against the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, which it accused of carrying out a ""massacre of civilians."" Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan's army chief and president, said his troops would take action over the incident. The RSF has denied carrying out a massacre, but has acknowledged conducting military operations near the town. Local officials initially said more than 100 people were shot Wednesday in Wad Al-Noora, with later reports saying the death toll could be as high as 200. Many more were believed to be wounded. Videos on social media, which could not be independently verified, show what was said to be the aftermath of the attack, with rows of bodies lined up ready for burial.  Sudan's military government, led by al-Burhan, called for international condemnation of the attack.  More than a year into the war in Sudan, roughly half of the country's population — some 25 million people — are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. In their worst-case outlooks, humanitarian agencies say 4 million children may be facing acute malnutrition, and 2.5 million could die of hunger.  It's a man-made humanitarian disaster that aid agencies say has been largely ignored by the world amid the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.  A recent report by Human Rights Watch claims an act of genocide may have been committed in the West Darfur city of El Geneina. The report lays out claims of alleged ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity committed against the ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in the city by the paramilitary RSF forces and their Arab allies. HRW has called for international sanctions against RSF leader Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, widely known as Hemedti. One report details an attack on June 15, 2023, that HRW says involved RSF and allied forces opening fire on a convoy of civilians fleeing El Geneina, allegedly killing 12 children and five adults from two families, before throwing their bodies ""into the river and their belongings in after them."" There is a long and bloody history of fighting over resources in Sudan, and the surrounding region. Former Sudanese President Omar el Bashir, who was ousted by the army in 2019, regularly exploited those conflicts, fanning the flames of ethnic violence for political gain.  His government created Arab militias in the early 2000s to quell rebellions by non-Arab farming and pastoralist communities. Those Arab militias became known as the Janjaweed and, later, the RSF paramilitary group emerged from their ranks.  The civil war broke out last year, starting as a power struggle between al-Burhan and Hemedti, but it has morphed into a larger proxy war as regional and foreign actors compete for influence and resources.  Saudi Arabia and Egypt back al-Burhan's government, and he has recently been working to forge closer ties with Iran and Russia.  Humanitarian groups and regional analysts say the United Arab Emirates and Russia have been providing arms and resources to the RSF. UAE officials have repeatedly denied those claims. In the most significant recent development, it seems almost certain that a deal is about to be signed between Moscow and al-Burhan's government to secure Russia a 25-year Red Sea port, in exchange for military hardware.  Russia has long sought access to the strategic Red Sea, with analysts saying they would expect considerable military hardware to be offered up in exchange for what's understood to be a small port base where Russia could position four warships and about 300 Russian soldiers. The two generals' battle for control of their country's resources has become a proxy war for major global powers vying for access to gold mines and Red Sea access. Sudan's capital Khartoum, one of the African continent's most populous cities, is now described as a battlefield, in a country whose people are on the brink of famine.

         Police in Los Angeles seized more than 2,800 boxes of stolen LEGO sets from a 71-year-old man's home Wednesday, authorities said.  Officers arrested 71-year-old Richard Siegel and his alleged accomplice, 39-year-old Blanca Gudino, after raiding the elderly man's Long Beach home, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.    The individual boxes have a retail value ranging from $20 to well over $1,000, police said.  Detectives started investigating the case after a retailer in San Pedro identified Gudino as the suspect who had allegedly robbed them several times last December.  Several months later, on June 4, officers witnessed Gudino stealing items from retailers in Torrance and Lakewood before dropping them off at Siegel's home. Detectives believe Siegel would sell the stolen goods online since several potential buyers showed up at his home while officers raided it.   Investigators booked Siegel for organized retail theft, while Gudino was booked with grand theft. The department urged anyone with information on the case to call detectives at (310) 726-7900. Those wishing to stay anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 1(800) 222-8477 or text them at 274637.  All text messages should begin with the ""LAPD.""

         Authorities are using boats to patrol the ocean and warning swimmers about sharks this weekend along Florida's Gulf Coast, where a woman and two teenage girls were hurt in two separate shark attacks on Friday. The attacks off beaches in the Florida Panhandle led authorities to temporarily close several beaches to swimmers on Friday. Beaches were reopened Saturday, with flags warning of high hazards. ""All I can say is that these incidents are very rare,"" said Demian Chapman, a scientist and director of the Center for Shark Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Sarasota, Florida. ""It's even more rare to have two events in one day involving three people,"" he told The Associated Press on Saturday. ""That's astronomically low odds of that happening."" In Walton County, the sheriff's office, fire department and the state's wildlife agency were working together to patrol the water with boats and the shore with vehicles, the South Walton Fire District said in an update Saturday. Both of Friday's attacks happened in Walton County. ""Please swim carefully today, respect the Gulf, stay hydrated, and look out for your loved ones,"" the fire department said on social media. Red and purple flags were being used Saturday to warn swimmers of the dangers. ""Purple Flags indicate the presence of dangerous marine life and single red flags indicate high hazard conditions,"" the Bay County Sheriff's Office said in a social media post on Saturday. Small fish are traveling in schools near the shore this time of year, which might have been a contributing factor in the attacks, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. The first attack happened Friday afternoon when a woman was bitten by a shark near WaterSound Beach, the Walton County Sheriff's Office said. She had critical injuries on her midsection and arm, and part of her arm had to be amputated, South Walton Fire Chief Ryan Crawford said at a news briefing. She was flown to a trauma center. Less than two hours later, firefighters responded to another beach about 4 miles east of the first attack ""following multiple reports of a teenager injured by a shark,"" the sheriff's office said. Two teenage girls were in waist-deep water with a group of friends when they were attacked, the South Walton Fire District said. ""When lifeguards and deputies arrived on scene, they found one of the females had significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand,"" fire officials said in an update. She was flown to a trauma center. The other teen had what officials described as minor injuries on one of her feet. The two teenagers are from Mountain Brook, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham, Mountain Brook City Manager Sam Gaston told the news site Al.com. There's no way of knowing whether it was one shark or two separate ones involved in Friday's attacks, but there are more sharks in the Gulf of Mexico than in past years, Chapman said. ""There's definitely been a recovery of sharks in the Gulf after many years of overfishing,"" he said. ""They're sort of out there again after being depleted quite a bit."" The time of the attacks — in the middle of the afternoon — was also an anomaly, Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson said. Sheriff's officials often warn people to be aware of sharks early in the morning and at dusk, their typical feeding times, he noted. On Saturday, Walton County sheriff's deputies patrolling the waters in a boat spotted a 14-foot hammerhead shark near Santa Rosa Beach, which they said is not unusual. Sheriff's officials say they don't know what type of shark attacked the swimmers on Friday. ""We want to reiterate that sharks are always present in the Gulf,"" the sheriff's office said in a Saturday post on social media. ""Swimmers and beachgoers should be cautious when swimming and stay aware of their surroundings."" The @WCSOFL Beach Marine Unit is monitoring the shoreline and the beaches today following yesterday's incidents involving sharks in Walton County.

Shark attacks are rare, according to experts. There were 69 unprovoked bites last year worldwide, and 10 of those were fatal, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. That was higher than the recent average of six deaths per year.

         With less than a month left to collect signatures in Nevada, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. submitted a new petition to the Nevada Secretary of State's office Thursday, despite having previously filed a lawsuit against the office in an attempt to secure his place on the state ballot. The independent candidate filed a lawsuit against the Nevada office last week, two months after learning that the campaign's collection of over 15,000 signatures in the state would be invalidated because the petition that was circulated to voters did not list a vice presidential pick, which is required by state law for ballot access. Now, Kennedy has submitted an amended petition, listing his running mate Nicole Shanahan, in case the lawsuit filed by the campaign does not result in a win for Kennedy. While a staffer at the office wrongly informed the Kennedy campaign in March that it did not need a vice presidential pick on the petition, the office maintained that the campaign received clear guidelines for ballot access in a memo the same month. The Kennedy campaign has claimed that the Democratic Party fabricated a new rule to invalidate his Nevada signatures, and in an email to the office Friday, Paul Rossi, the Kennedy campaign's lead ballot access attorney, said, ""the SOS has reversed [its] position.""  However, Nevada has required independent candidates to name a vice presidential candidate on their petitions since 1993. ""Given the conduct of the SOS, I want and expect this approved today"" in the event that ""the federal lawsuit does not quickly yield the expected injunction against the secretary's new position on VP names on the petition,"" Rossi wrote in his email after submitting the amended petition.   The Kennedy campaign has until July 5 to submit new signatures to the office, which can be collected using the amended petition now including Shanahan's name, the office told Rossi Friday. With less than a month left, the campaign will work to collect roughly 10,000 new signatures in Nevada while the lawsuit continues. Michael Arno, who runs a petition signature gathering company and has worked on ballot access for various independent candidates and the No Labels effort, said gathering that many signatures and more within that time frame should be ""very easy."" Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar previously stated that his office is prepared to face Kennedy in court. ""Nevada has a rich history of independent and third party candidates for office. Each of those candidates managed to attain ballot access by following the law. We look forward to seeing Mr. Kennedy's team in court,"" Aguilar said in a statement to CBS News last week.  RFK Jr. files new petition in Nevada amid legal battle over ballot access by Faris Tanyos on Scribd As Kennedy scrambles to gain ballot access in Nevada, some Democratic Party leaders worry he may siphon votes from President Biden in the key battleground state. Mr. Biden won Nevada by over 30,000 votes in 2020 against former President Donald Trump. Somos PAC, a Latino-focused, left-leaning political organization, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of Nevada to intervene in the Kennedy campaign's suit. ""Ballot access laws are an essential pillar of our community and our democracy that safeguards voters and ensures they are informed on who they are petitioning to be on November's ballot. If RFK Jr.'s campaign cared about hardworking Nevadans, they would put all their efforts into collecting signatures and going through the proper channels to be included on the ballot while there is still plenty of time,"" said Melissa Morales, president and founder of Somos PAC. Supporters of the late Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader and a Nevada native, have turned their attention to Kennedy, and are hoping to slow down his efforts in the state through door-knocking. Reid, who died in 2021, was known for political organizing and voter mobilization, and his voter coalition, known as the ""Reid Machine,"" played a crucial role in securing several statewide Democratic victories, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's win in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in Nevada. ""Does anyone actually know why RFK is running for president? This is the definition of a vanity run that could have very serious ramifications for the country,"" said Kristin Ramos, a former advisor to Reid. ""Nevada is a must win state for both campaigns, and it's hard to say right now who RFK is playing a spoiler for."" Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity this week that he would be open to debating Kennedy, saying ""it's important to have him"" but that Kennedy's ""poll numbers are terrible."" ""His numbers are lousy and they seem to be getting worse,"" the former president said. ""But I don't mind having him the debate. I think it would be good but his numbers are too low.""

         The Food and Drug Administration has approved giving GSK's vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus down to age 50 years old, to those who are at higher risk of severe RSV, the company said Friday, making it the first shot greenlit for use in this age group to guard against RSV. Global vaccine and drugmaker GSK asked the FDA in February to expand approval beyond adults 60 and older, citing data showing the immune response in adults vaccinated from this younger age group looked similar. Further trials are planned looking at adults between 18 and 49 years old, GSK said, with results expected in the second half of this year.  Two other companies – Pfizer and Moderna – also manufacture RSV vaccines approved for adults 60 and older, and are testing their shots in younger adults. Pfizer told investors last month it was getting ready to submit ""positive"" data from studies of its own shot down to age 18. GSK's vaccine will next need to be recommended for adults between 50 and 59 years old by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Their backing, at upcoming meetings in June or October, would tee up insurance coverage. Vaccinating adults in their 50s for RSV likely has a public health benefit, a work group within the CDC's committee concluded last year ahead of the approval, though it is narrower than for older adults who are at higher risk from their age alone. Under 60 years old, pre-existing medical issues play larger roles in the risk of RSV infections taking a dangerous turn.  ""A lot of disease comes because the virus is triggering your underlying medical conditions, whether it's COPD, heart failure, etc. So the virus is more of a trigger for exacerbation,"" said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, senior vice president and global head of vaccines research and development at GSK.  Dormitzer said GSK had seen ""relatively comparable"" safety results from its vaccine in this group, compared to when it was given to those 60 and over. Some of the vaccine's side effects did look to be a little stronger, likely as a result of better immune responses in this age group. The CDC panel has also previously wrestled with rare but serious cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome seen after the use of the RSV shots.  Around 1.5 cases of the syndrome per million doses given of GSK's vaccine have been reported, the CDC said last week. The agency's survey data has found that close to a quarter of adults ages 60 and older had received an RSV shot since they were approved last year. GSK's trials did not turn up any ""concerning"" trends of GBS cases in the 50 to 59 age group, Dormitzer said. ""The risk of GBS tends to go up, it's another one of those risks that tends to go up, with age. But there's nothing to indicate that there's any particular risk of GBS,"" he said. The CDC panel is also expected to weigh the possibility of whether and when adults will need to start getting booster shots for RSV. Dormitzer said GSK is planning on presenting more trial results to the CDC committee in June, looking at boosters spaced out as much as three years after an initial shot. ""This is a really key question. People originally anticipated it might have to be an every year immunization. But then we found the duration of protection actually lasts for more than one season, clearly,"" he said. Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

         (CBS DETROIT) — A teen gunman who pleaded guilty in a 2021 deadly shooting at Michigan's Oxford High School has filed an appeal of his life sentence, arguing that new evidence questions whether he understood his guilty plea. In a statement Friday, the Michigan Appellate Defender Office, which is representing 18-year-old Ethan Crumbley, said a motion was filed requesting the trial court review new evidence and grant a resentencing, arguing that the sentence ""for a child is unconscionable."" Crumbley pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including murder and terrorism, in the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting at his high school that killed four people and injured seven others. In December 2023, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Records show he is housed in the Oaks Correctional Facility, an all-male facility. ""Some of that new evidence includes seven witnesses who could have discussed Ethan's childhood struggles and his mother's alcohol abuse during pregnancy; the potential impact of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder on Ethan's life including the social and emotional maturity of a child younger than their chronological age; and an expert witness to properly present information about Ethan and his childhood rather than one who cut and pasted information from other reports and did not understand the indicia for evaluating a life without parole sentence for a child,"" the defender's office statement read.  The shooter's parents, Jennifer and James Crumbley, were each found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in separate trials earlier this year for their roles in the shooting, and were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison.  During their trials, prosecutors argued that the shooting was preventable, and that James and Jennifer Crumbley ignored their son's mental health needs and bought him the gun that was used in the shooting.   The Crumbleys have since obtained appellate attorneys in their cases, claiming that they were wrongly convicted. The defender office argues that new evidence does not support the life without parole sentencing and is requesting the shooter is given a ""constitutional sentence that is appropriate for a 15-year-old child."" The shooter, who turned 18 earlier this year, was 15 at the time of the shooting. ""Due process requires that every person who pleads must understand what they are doing, this is even more true when the person pleading is a child,"" read a statement from the defender office. In May, a judge denied the shooter's request to his parents' that their pre-sentence reports be used in his appeal. The shooter asked a state court for the reports that were used in his parents' trials, arguing that his family and home environment are relevant to his appeal. The sentencing court was required to consider his family background, including his home environment, because he was a minor at the time of the shooting. In response, prosecutors did not take a position on the matter, and noted the parents' pre-sentence reports were not created until months after the shooter was sentenced. An attorney for Jennifer Crumbley wrote in a court filing that the documents are ""privileged and confidential"" and she had ""not waived her statutory privilege allowing the disclosure of her pre-sentence report."" James Crumbley's attorney wrote that the shooter is ""able-bodied"" and ""capable of advising his counsel about his childhood, his parents and his home environment. Counsel has failed to explain to this Honorable Court why they cannot learn this evidence from him directly."" DeJanay Booth-Singleton is a digital producer at CBS Detroit.

         Marketing in the friendly skies is getting personal, with United Airlines now displaying targeted ads on seat-back screens as the carrier looks to cash in on customer data.  United passengers who toggle through the in-flight film and TV show options already see ads during programming. That includes a 30-second commercial that will now reflect the information United has compiled on individual travelers, like where they live and destinations they've traveled to.  ""We've built a first-of-its-kind, real-time, adtech-enabled traveler media network where brands have already started connecting to premium audiences at an unmatched scale,"" Richard Nunn, CEO of United's MileagePlus, said Friday in a statement announcing the launch.  ""There has been a huge strategic shift within this high-growth sector in the past five years, where advertisers and brands have come together to determine how best to connect with consumers in a way that's valuable, effective and personalized,"" according to Nunn. The airline has nearly 100,000 seat-back screens across its fleet, with the potential for 3.5 hours of attention per traveler, based on average flight time. United said it would will only use information on passengers 18 and older, and all customers have the option of opting-out of the targeted advertising at any time. The Department of Transportation in March disclosed an industrywide review of data security and privacy policies across the nation's biggest airlines to determine if they are adequately protecting passengers' personal information. ""Airline passengers should have confidence that their personal information is not being shared improperly with third parties or mishandled by employees,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stated in a statement at the time.

         The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet next week, and the decisions made during that meeting could have a meaningful impact on various aspects of the financial market, from the interest rates being offered on credit cards and loans to returns on deposit accounts and bonds. And, the results of the Fed meeting can also have an impact on the price of gold. After all, gold is considered a safe-haven asset, and the factors that impact financial markets can also have an impact on gold's price. So, if you're thinking about investing in gold, you may want to make your move before the Fed meets. Here's why. Compare your gold investing options now.  Here are three reasons you should buy gold before the Fed meeting next week:  When the Fed meets, one topic of discussion will be the federal funds rate, which serves as the benchmark rate for consumer interest rates. The Fed uses its benchmark rate to keep inflation at, or near, its 2% target. When inflation is too low, the Fed may lower its benchmark rate to spur spending and drive price growth. And, when inflation is too high, it may increase the benchmark interest rate to help curb consumer spending and minimize price growth. In turn, these benchmark rate changes can have an impact on the price of gold. For example, interest rate hikes often lead to higher demand for gold, driving the price up. That's worth noting because inflation has been persistently higher than the Fed's 2% target over the last couple of years, which is why the federal funds rate is currently paused at a 23-year high.  And, while the most recent inflation report indicated that inflation has cooled compared to recent highs, the rate was still 3.4% in April, which is significantly higher than the Fed's target rate. So, a rate hike is one possible outcome of the Fed meeting.  If the Fed increases its federal funds rate, or if there is concern that a rate hike could happen, the price of gold could increase due to an uptick in demand. So, it may be wise to buy gold before the Fed's June meeting.  Get started with gold investing here before the Fed meets next week.  The spot price of gold is currently $2,347.39 per ounce (as of June 7, 2024). That's down by about 4% compared to its recent record high of $2,439.98.  And, the price of gold may head back up soon. For starters, not only is the Fed set to meet next week, but other drivers that could push up gold demand are present, too. Inflation is still a cause for concern, and the ongoing geopolitical tensions could also help to drive price growth in the near future.  So, it could be a smart move to invest in gold now while the price is lower than it was a few weeks ago. That way, you may be able to benefit from any future gains.  Gold also serves as an inflation hedge and diversification tool for many investors, so if you need an asset that can offer these unique benefits, gold may be a good option.  For starters, gold's price has historically climbed in tandem with the prices of goods and services when inflation is high. So, adding gold to your portfolio could help to offset inflation-related losses from other assets in your portfolio.  Gold doesn't typically move in tandem with stocks, bonds and other traditional portfolio assets, either. So, adding it to your portfolio could improve your risk-adjusted returns. And, with potential changes to monetary policy just days away, it may be wise to add gold to your portfolio now.  Next week's Fed meeting could push the price of gold upward. And, since gold's price is currently down from its recent record high price, buying it now means you could get it at a discount comparatively. Plus, adding gold to your investments could help protect your portfolio by acting as an inflation hedge and diversification tool. Compare your gold investment options now, before the Fed meets next week.  Joshua Rodriguez is a personal finance and investing writer with a passion for his craft.

         Customers like Trader Joe's mini accessories so much that they are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for bags that retail for just a few bucks. The grocery chain is now selling mini insulated tote bags in stores for $3.99 each after it quickly sold out of $2.99 mini canvas tote bags that proved so popular that they were selling on resale sites for up to 200 times their retail price. The mini bags have become a mega trend, with the insulated versions listed for sale on resale sites like Ebay for up to $50 each. The bags come in two colors — ""hot magenta"" and ""cool teal."" Consumers are scouring resale sites just days after the bags were released and given that they are already sold out at some grocery stores, according to posts on social media. Trader Joe's touts the mini bags as ""Great for lunches, travel & outdoor activities."" They hold up to 1.5 gallons of food and drink. It's unclear why the items, which resemble traditional kids' lunch bags with soft exteriors, are so popular. Instagram account @trader_joes_treasure_hunt, described as a fan page that shares new finds from the grocer with its followers, first shared an image of the mini cooler bags five days ago, when the account holder spotted them in a store.  ""They should be out by Tuesday the 4th! Who's excited and making an extra pit stop to pick them up,"" the post read. More than 6,000 Instagram users liked the post on social media. Other users who'd snapped up the bags indicated that shoppers are limited to buying two per customer.  A spokesperson for Trader Joe's told CBS MoneyWatch the company expects to have more cooler bags in stock ""later this summer,"" and that purchase limits are set by individual stores.  Megan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

         Washington — President Biden said Thursday that he wouldn't pardon his son, Hunter Biden, if he is convicted of felony charges stemming from his alleged purchase of a handgun while he was a drug user. In an interview with ABC News' David Muir, the president was asked whether he had ruled out a pardon for Hunter Biden, to which Mr. Biden replied, ""Yes."" The president also said ""yes"" when questioned on whether he would accept the verdict in Hunter Biden's trial on the gun charges that is underway in Delaware, regardless of the outcome. Hunter Biden was indicted on three counts last year in connection to his purchase of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver in October 2018, which prosecutors alleged he unlawfully possessed for 11 days. Two of the charges stem from claims he made false statements on a federal gun form about his drug use. The president's son allegedly certified in paperwork that he was not a user of or addicted to any controlled substance, but prosecutors have said he was addicted to crack cocaine when he bought and kept the handgun. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all counts. A trial began in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, and prosecutors are expected to call their last witness Friday. The defense will then present its case, and it remains unknown whether Hunter Biden will take the stand. First lady Jill Biden attended the trial for several days before traveling to France to join Mr. Biden for events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy on Thursday. She returned to Wilmington, Delaware, later Thursday and was in the courthouse for Friday's proceedings. The first lady will travel back to France for a state visit over the weekend. Other members of Hunter Biden's family have attended the trial, including his half-sister, Ashley Biden. In his interview with ABC News, Mr. Biden also addressed the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump by a New York jury last week. The former president, and Mr. Biden's opponent in this year's presidential race, was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records stemming from a hush-money payment his lawyer made to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Mr. Biden said Trump received a ""fair trial."" ""The jury spoke like they speak in all cases, and it should be respected,"" he told Muir. The president criticized Trump's Republican supporters who have denounced the verdict and trial as unfair and the result of a politically motivated prosecution. ""Stop undermining the rule of law,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Stop undermining the institutions."" Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

         The U.S. labor market continues to simmer as the economy added significantly more jobs than expected in May, furthering the view that the Federal Reserve will wait until at least September to cut interest rates. Employment data also showed the jobless rate inching slightly higher to 4% from 3.9% in April, breaching a 27-month stretch of holding below that threshold.  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 272,000 jobs last month, exceeding forecasts of 180,000. Downward revisions had 15,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April combined.  Stocks opened lower in the wake of the data, which had helped to allay Wall Street worries that the economy was headed down a dark path, but also pushing back the timing of an interest rate cut by the Fed. In welcome news for workers but likely adding to hesitation by the central bank, the May report showed hourly wages rising a robust 14 cents, or 0.4%, to $34.91, up 4.1% over the past 12 months.  ""Current wage gains are outpacing the recent rate of inflation, helping individuals and households to recover some of their lost buying power,"" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said in a note.  Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, noted that the strong job growth in May contrasts with other signals the economy is revving down. Still, she thinks the hiring spurt last month, coupled with the pickup in wages, could keep a rate cut on hold as the Fed waits for clear evidence that the economy is slowing enough to further tamp down inflation.  ""We had been anticipating the start of rate cuts in September, totaling 50 [basis points] of cuts this year, but the persevering strong employment gains raises the likelihood of later rate cuts,"" Bostjancic said in a report. While exceeding forecasts, the latest jobs readout is not out of line with the narrative of an economy coming in for a ""soft landing,"" rather than plunging toward a recession. A number above 300,000 would raise concerns about the jobs market overheating, according to Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.

         The U.S. Coast Guard said it offloaded more than 4,800 pounds of cocaine worth over $63 million at a port in Florida on Thursday — two days after officials said Coast Guard officers fired at and sank a speedboat suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea. The cocaine offloaded on Thursday was the result of two operations off the coast of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, the Coast Guard said in a social media post. The operation was conducted by a Royal Netherlands Navy patrol boat, which had a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment and helicopter interdiction tactical squadron on board. ❌❄️@USCG Cutter Resolute's crew offloaded more than 4,800 pounds of cocaine, worth over $63 million, at @PortEverglades, Thurs. This offload was the result of 2 interdictions by HNMLS Groningen with embarked USCG LEDET 110 and HITRON, 24 miles north of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. pic.twitter.com/efJcbD8f4i The announcement of the cocaine seizures came just two days after authorities said the same Dutch navy ship and U.S. Coast Guard assets in the Caribbean Sea ""identified a vessel suspected of smuggling narcotics in international waters."" Officials said in a news release Thursday that the suspected drug vessel, a speedboat, failed to stop early Tuesday morning when signaled and instead headed straight toward the Dutch patrol boat. Dutch Navy officers and U.S. Coast Guard members on board the patrol boat fired their weapons at the speedboat ""in self-defense and defense of others in response to the life-threatening situation,"" officials said. The speedboat caught fire and sank, and three suspected smugglers went overboard and disappeared below the water, the Coast Guard said.   The U.S. Coast Guard, Royal Netherlands Navy and Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard suspended search efforts for the three suspects on Tuesday evening, officials said. There were no reported injuries to the Dutch and U.S. officers. ""The Coast Guard is America's primary maritime law enforcement agency, and our crews work hard to safely bring suspected smugglers to face federal prosecution in the United States for alleged crimes,"" Lt. Cmdr. John W. Beal said in a statement Thursday. The cocaine seizure and shootout in the Caribbean Sea come about a week after a separate Coast Guard crew offloaded $468 million worth of cocaine in San Diego.  That haul was the result of eight separate operations off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America.    International drug traffickers routinely use different kinds of boats to move narcotics. In May, Italian police announced the seizure of a remote-controlled submarine likely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network. Also last month, the French navy said it seized 2.4 tons of cocaine from a Venezuelan fishing boat about 1,500 kilometers northeast of the Caribbean island of Martinique. In March, authorities announced a massive cocaine shipment seizure in the Caribbean Sea off of Colombia after military ships and planes chased down a speedboat holding almost four tons of the drug. Earlier that month, a British warship and an American patrol aircraft chased down a speedboat as its crew tried to flee and dump its cargo of drugs into the water near the U.S. Virgin Islands. British sailors and a U.S. Coast Guard team eventually recovered about 6,000 pounds of cocaine and other drugs, officials said. Much larger semi-submersibles, which cannot go fully underwater, are popular among international drug traffickers as they can often elude detection by authorities. The so-called ""narco-subs"" are sometimes seized in Colombian waters while heading to the United States, Central America and Europe.     Stephen Smith is a managing editor for CBSNews.com based in New York.

         Whether you need to pay for a costly medical procedure or are thinking about using your home equity as a down payment on a second home, you may be thinking about tapping into $60,000 worth of your home's equity soon. But before you borrow against your home equity, it's important to make sure you can afford the payments.   After all, when you take out a home equity loan, your home is used as collateral. And, if you're unable to afford the payments and default on the loan, you could put your home in jeopardy. So how much would your monthly payments be if you take out a $60,000 home equity loan?  Compare leading home equity loan options today.  When you take out a home equity loan, factors like the amount of money you borrow, your term, your interest rate and how the interest can impact the cost of your monthly payments.  Home equity loan terms typically range from five to 30 years, with 10- and 15-year terms being some of the most common. The average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is currently 8.76%, and the average rate for a 15-year home equity loan is currently 8.74%.  Here's what you can expect to pay each month based on the above loan terms and rates:  A home equity loan isn't the only way you can access $60,000 worth of home equity, though. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are another option to consider, but interest rates on these credit lines are variable, your monthly HELOC payment could change periodically if rates shift. But if your HELOC rate and payment stayed the same through the 15-year repayment period, your HELOC payments on a $60,000 balance at today's average interest rate of 9.18% would be $615 per month and you would pay $50,700.25 in total interest.  Get the money you need with a home equity loan now.  If you want to find a low-rate or lower-cost home equity loan, the following strategies could come in handy: Financial institutions compete with one another for your business, and one way they do that is to offer different rates on home equity borrowing products. In turn, some lenders will have lower rates than others, so it's important to shop around.  ""You should compare rates before you choose one,"" explains Alex Blackwood, CEO and co-founder of Mogul Club, a real estate investing platform. ""Look up lenders that provide home equity loans and pull indicative rates from a number of them, so you can ensure you're getting the best rate possible.""  ""Lenders check your credit score to determine how large of a loan and how low of a rate they'll offer, so it's important to keep your credit score as strong as possible before applying for the loan,"" says Blackwood.  So, you may want to focus on improving your credit before you apply. Even small improvements to your credit score can make a meaningful difference in your monthly payments and overall cost.    While borrowing less money may not impact your rate directly, it could impact the costs each month. For example, the more you borrow, the higher you can expect your home equity loan payments to be. So, you may want to only borrow what you need to keep your loan costs to a minimum.   Find out how affordable your home equity loan could be today.  At today's average rates, you can expect to pay between $599.31 and $752.28 per month on a $60,000 home equity loan. However, the rate you get depends on a range of factors, and in certain cases, it may be possible to find even lower rates than the average. To do so, consider shopping around, working to improve your credit score or borrowing less to make your home equity loan more affordable. Compare your home equity loan options now.  Joshua Rodriguez is a personal finance and investing writer with a passion for his craft.

         June 8 marks 1,000 days since the Taliban banned girls over the age of 12 from all schools in Afghanistan. The ban, issued just days after the group retook control over Afghanistan in 2021, has left hundreds of thousands of girls with little hope of a formal education. Human Rights Watch said in a statement marking the 1,000 days that Afghan society ""will never fully recover"" from the loss of so many future female professionals, especially in a country that was already struggling with low youth literacy rates. The United Nations accuses the Taliban of enforcing a ""gender apartheid"" with its draconian edicts, policies and system of institutionalized discrimination against women and girls, calling Afghanistan under the hard-line Islamists a ""graveyard of buried hopes."" Despite the risks, however, many Afghan girls have refused to give up hope, and they've turned to unofficial schools hidden away from the eyes of the Taliban to continue getting an education. Their hope is that if the Taliban regime collapses or is forced through international pressure to relax its restrictions, their clandestine schooling will keep them apace with their international peers, and enable them to pass exams. Many of the unofficial underground schools in Afghanistan operate with limited resources — of both supplies and educators. They get support from women's rights and education activists outside the country, who send monthly funding for textbooks and teachers' wages. The Pohana Fund is one of the many private groups that support the secret schools, mainly in the southern and eastern provinces of Afghanistan. The organization's founder, Wazhma Tokhi, who left Afghanistan and now lives in Europe, told CBS News the network of schools supported by her group has about 1,300 teenage girls as students. ""My aim in establishing these schools is to help girls continue their education, particularly those in remote and underdeveloped provinces, who are deprived of their basic rights to study beyond grade six,"" Tokhi told CBS News. Sherin, whose real name CBS News is not using due to the nature of her work in Afghanistan, is a rights activist and the sole teacher at one of Pohana's underground schools in the southern province of Helmand — the ancestral home of the Taliban. She was a teacher before the Taliban's ban, and has continued her work clandestinely since. She told CBS News she's still teaching many of her former students, offering two sessions per day, each with 20 students, with financial assistance from the Pohana Fund. ""Teaching 40 students in two sessions is challenging, but I'm committed to helping these girls who have endured a lot,"" Sherin told CBS News in a phone interview. ""I do it for my students, who are under immense mental pressure, who have experienced severe mental health issues after the Taliban closed their schools."" Her students range from the seventh grade to the 11th, and the subjects they study include some barred entirely under the new Taliban-approved curriculum, including for boys. According to students who spoke with CBS News, Sherin's classes are a last hope to escape the mental anguish of being denied an education. Some said continuing education was a way to avoid being married off by their families. ""It is a risky choice to educate these girls, but I have chosen this path,"" Sherin said. ""The Taliban will punish us if they discover this school, because I am teaching girls who are supposed to be at home, according to Taliban orders, and because I receive funding from abroad."" Najiba, whose name CBS News has also changed, is 15 and would have been in ninth grade this year, if her school was still open. Instead, she attends Sherin's secret school, hoping and preparing for a brighter future, and refusing to give up on her dream of becoming a neurosurgeon. ""When I heard the Taliban opened schools only for the boys in the 2024 academic year, I felt humiliated, because women are worthless in the eyes of the Taliban,"" she told CBS News on the phone. Most of Afghanistan's secret schools operate, at least ostensibly, as Islamic religious schools, or madrasas. The Taliban's regulation of madrasas, and even unsanctioned schools, varies significantly depending on the location and the local officials involved, according to teachers who spoke with CBS News from three different provinces. In some provinces, particularly in the traditional Taliban strongholds in the south and east, local authorities enforce a strict ban on girls' education. In other areas, however, there are unspoken understandings between local authorities and teachers. Some teachers said they run schools from their homes made to look outwardly like religious schools, and some said they were even tipped off by local authorities of potential visits by auditors from the Taliban-run Ministry of Education. ""The Taliban in our area know that we also teach school subjects,"" said one teacher in the capital, Kabul. ""I can no longer hide this from them … Somehow, they help us by giving us a heads-up before auditors visit."" But the inconsistency, and the rapid punishment for anyone who dares to flout the Taliban's strict rules, mean many thousands of girls are still being denied basic rights. Lima, 17, is a student at another one of Afghanistan's underground schools for girls.  ""I felt that I was deprived of my human rights just because I was a woman in Afghanistan,"" she told CBS News. ""I wanted to be an independent woman and decide my future, but the Taliban took away those rights from us."" She had to stop the conversation, overwhelmed by her emotions. While these young women are still finding ways to get around the Taliban's internationally condemned crackdown on their basic human rights, it's widely expected that Afghanistan will continue to see many of its educated and professional women flee for countries with more opportunities. ""Afghanistan will never fully recover from these 1,000 days,"" Human Rights Watch's associate director for women's rights, Heather Barr, said in the group's statement. ""The potential lost in this time – the artists, doctors, poets, and engineers who will never get to lend their country their skills –   cannot be replaced. Every additional day, more dreams die.""

         A Vermont police department has apologized for a mock shooting that took place at the station while students were there as part of a school program.  The Burlington High School students were visiting the Burlington Police Department through a school Year End Studies, or YES, forensics program.  The mock shooting was a ""roll-playing (sic) scenario"" where three members of the Burlington Police Department simulated ""a robbery scenario,"" according to a news release from the department.  The simulation was ""not directed at any students or faculty,"" the department said, but was witnessed by the visiting students. One student told local outlet the Vermont Public she did not know about the planned scenario. She said that during the simulation, two screaming women burst into the room, followed by a man in a ski mask. The simulation was accompanied by gunshot sounds, the student said.  ""It was laughed about afterwards,"" she told the Vermont Public. ""(It) just made it feel like a prank, basically — not much of a demonstration.""  The department said that it had communicated the plans for the simulation with school officials. ""On 23 May 2024, police department staff and YES program staff communicated about the details of the scenarios, including saying that the training incident would involve 'using fake firearms in a mock shooting. Do you think that sort of incident would be ok for your group of students? It is about as real life as you can get, and is certainly exactly the sort of thing we deal with most frequently,'"" the department said in the news release.  ""YES Program staff responded, 'I think these students will be fine with this simulation. We will give a heads up to parents and students,'"" the department continued. The Burlington School District did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.  The police department said it would meet with students Friday to talk about the presentation and its impact. The mother of a student told local outlet Seven Days that she feared the incident could exacerbate children's fears around gun violence.  ""I'm baffled,"" she told the publication. ""It is a very real threat to kids these days to have a school shooting. It's something they worry about."" Kerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com. A graduate of New York University's Arthur L.

         Maritime archaeologists have recovered several grave markers from the United Kingdom's oldest shipwreck.  The Mortar Wreck, named for its collection of marble mortars found aboard, was discovered off the coast of Dorset, England in 2020 and granted protected status in 2022.  Researchers have already brought items including pottery and kitchen objects above the surface, but a recent expedition by a team from England's Bournemouth University recovered multiple carved grave slabs and stone mortars made for grinding flour, CBS partner BBC News reported.  Dr. Derek Pitman, the head of archaeology at Bournemouth University, told BBC News that the 13th-century wreck was ""really well preserved."" He believes the ship, which had a ""relatively large cargo,"" hit choppy waters as it was departing from Dorset's Poole Harbor.  The stone found aboard the ship was likely brought from southern England to Dorset, where it was loaded aboard. For centuries, the items remained at the bottom of Poole Bay. ""It was full of stone mortars and burial slabs. I've never seen anything like it,"" Pitman told the BBC. Prepping the 800yo #purbeckmarble grave slabs from the #mortarwreck pic.twitter.com/gOdXHhQDzT Raising the stone slabs required a ""monstrous barge,"" Pitman said. The ""huge crates"" were lifted onto the barge. Photos and videos from the operation show divers using machinery to lift the heavy slabs, which would have covered gravestones.  They and the mortars brought up from the wreck will undergo conservation work, according to the BBC, and be put on display at the Poole Museum.  Kerry Breen is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

         With persistent inflation driving up the costs of groceries, gas, housing and other essentials, millions of Americans are facing serious financial strain right now. And, the situation is even more dire for those carrying high-interest credit card debt, as the Fed's rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 had a big impact on credit card rates. For example, the average credit card currently carries an average APR of nearly 21.6%, but there is no federal cap on how high credit card interest rates can be, so many cards come with rates that are higher than that.  And, with the cost of living still climbing, many people currently have no choice but to turn to high-rate credit cards to pay for essentials that they otherwise couldn't afford. But that can be a risky approach, as the exorbitant interest rates tied to credit cards can cause your balance to compound quickly, ultimately resulting in delinquent payments, maxed-out credit limits and other serious debt troubles.  So, if you find yourself in the difficult position of juggling mounting credit card balances while cash is tight, it's crucial to take action quickly before the situation worsens. While there's no easy fix for getting out of credit card debt, especially when funds are limited, there are strategies you can use to quickly chip away at what you owe and reduce burdensome interest costs.  Need a fresh start? Find out more about your debt relief options here. There are a few options for getting rid of your credit card debt when you're dealing with a lower-than-average income or a tight budget, including: Many debt relief companies offer credit card debt settlement programs, also known as credit card debt forgiveness programs, to those they work with. These programs are intended to help those who are unable to keep up with their current credit card debts, and the goal is to have a portion of the credit card balance forgiven or ""charged off"" by the lender.  To pursue this route, you'll typically need to make a strong case for your inability to repay what you owe. After all, credit card companies are more likely to forgive a portion of your debt if it's clear that you can't feasibly repay the whole balance. If successful, though, your credit card balance will be reduced, and the remaining balance will be settled with a lump-sum payment.  Find out how the right debt relief options can help you get rid of your credit card debt. Rather than having a debt relief company negotiate with creditors to forgive your debt, you could try negotiating directly with card issuers to try and settle your balance for less than the full amount owed. By taking the do-it-yourself (DIY) route, you can save money on fees charged by the debt relief company, though it will take more work on your end.  During negotiations, you'll propose a lump sum payment you can afford, perhaps using funds from savings or other sources. The creditor may accept the deal to avoid greater losses through a lengthy default process, simply writing off the settled portion of the debt. Just be sure to get any settlement amount and terms agreed upon in writing before making a payment. Debt management is another option worth considering if you're trying to get rid of high-rate credit card debt quickly while on a tight budget. When you enroll in a debt management plan, the interest rates or fees tied to your credit card debt are negotiated down through special arrangements between the agency or company you work with and your creditors. You then make a single monthly payment to an accredited credit counseling or debt relief agency, which distributes the money to your creditors to pay down each of your enrolled debts on a set schedule.  Your credit may take a hit when you enroll in one of these programs, as you're typically required to close all enrolled accounts. However, completing the plan allows you to become debt-free in three to five years, on average. Although that may not seem like a quick solution, it can take decades to pay off your card debt by making minimum payments alone, so it's certainly a faster approach in many cases. Most major card issuers offer internal hardship plans, hardship forbearance or other relief programs for cardholders who are facing financial difficulties due to job loss, medical issues or other short-term hardship. Under these programs, your card issuers may offer temporarily reduced interest rates and minimum payments, offering you some relief from the high costs of your debt and allowing you to expedite the payoff process.  However, enrollment is typically approved based on your specific situation and the requirements may be strict. So, if you think you may qualify for a credit card hardship program, you should try to start the application process early, and if you find that you don't qualify, you may want to consider one or more of the other options on this list. When all other options are exhausted, you may find that your credit card debt and limited income mean you need to explore more drastic measures like debt restructuring or even bankruptcy to gain legal protection from creditors.  For example, Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates a court-approved repayment plan for paying back a portion of debts over time. On the other hand, Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges most debts entirely.  While these options severely impact your credit, they do provide an opportunity for a fresh financial start if your situation is dire. And, bankruptcy may be the fastest path to getting rid of your debt. There are several potential paths for fast credit card debt relief, so how do you determine the best solution for your situation? Start by taking an honest assessment of your complete financial picture, including income, expenses, assets and overall debt levels. Those with relatively low balances and some available funds may have success negotiating lump-sum settlements or qualifying for debt consolidation loans. Those who are truly insolvent with no assets may need to pursue bankruptcy. Your credit standing is another major factor. Good credit opens more options, like balance transfers and loans. Damaged credit means lenders are unlikely to approve new financing, making debt management plans or creditor negotiations better paths. You also need to consider how quickly you need relief. Bankruptcy provides the fastest fresh start, while debt management takes several years to complete. And, you should also consider what you're willing to sacrifice, and what you're not, to get rid of your debt. For example, you may be willing to take a credit score hit to become debt-free faster through bankruptcy. Or, your goal may be to preserve your credit score as much as possible through options like hardship plans that don't directly impact it. While digging out of deep credit card debt on limited funds is undoubtedly challenging, the strategies outlined above can provide potential paths forward. But no matter what option you pursue, taking quick action is key to preventing the compounding interest and late fees that can rapidly intensify the situation. Depending on the situation, it may also benefit you to consult a qualified credit counselor or bankruptcy attorney if you're facing overwhelming debt. That way, you can make fully informed decisions for your circumstances and get back on the road to solid financial footing.

         Stubborn inflation has continued to impact the finances of Americans across the nation. However, seniors on limited incomes may be feeling a lot of financial pain in particular. After all, rising prices caused by high inflation means that many are devoting a higher percentage of their incomes to necessities like food, housing and fuel.  And, due to these higher costs, an increased number of people, seniors included, may be using their credit cards to stay afloat, as indicated by the recent data that shows about one in five credit cards are maxed out. High amounts of credit card debt and other debts can be especially damaging to seniors' finances, as limited income can mean they may struggle to pay their statement balances in full to avoid compounding interest charges.  In turn, it may take seniors a long time to escape credit card debt, but that doesn't always have to be the case. There are several options seniors have for consolidating credit card debt and paying it off faster. Not sure which strategy is best? Learn more about your debt relief options online here. Here are some good consolidation options seniors have if they want to pay off debt faster. If you can qualify for a lower rate than the average rate on your credit cards, a debt consolidation loan could be your best option, says Ohan Kayikchyan, a certified financial planner and founder of Ohan The Money Doctor. A debt consolidation loan is a type of loan you can use to merge multiple debts, like high-interest credit cards, into a single debt. And, securing a lower-rate debt consolidation loan could save you thousands of dollars in interest over time. That said, you may have trouble qualifying for a debt consolidation loan with a lower rate if you have poor credit or other blemishes on your credit report. In these cases, it may not make much sense to consider a debt consolidation loan — unless the streamlined payments that come with rolling multiple debt obligations into one make it easier on your finances. Explore your top debt consolidation and debt relief options now. Debt relief companies can help you consolidate your debt with a loan from a lender partner, which works much like taking out a debt consolidation loan through other means. And, these debt relief companies can also negotiate lower rates on your behalf or help you settle the debt (and pay less than what you owe).  As a result, using a debt relief service could help you consolidate your credit card debt or offer other ways to get out of debt faster and save money. However, this option comes with a few trade-offs. For example, when you enroll in a credit card forgiveness plan to settle your debt, it can damage your credit score. In turn, it's important to make sure you understand the risks of debt settlement before enrolling, Dr. Kate Mielitz, an accredited financial counselor, says.  ""You may be sued — many times the debt relief company can resolve the debt before the judgment is handed down,"" says Mielitz.  For example, you might end up paying more than the amount you originally agreed to satisfy the terms a debt relief company makes with your original creditor to avoid wage garnishment, says Mielitz.  As an alternative to working with a debt relief program, Mielitz recommends contacting someone at a not-for-profit counseling agency, like the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, to see if a debt management plan is a better choice. Leslie H. Tayne, Esq, founder and head attorney at Tayne Law Group, P.C., a debt relief firm based in New York, has a different perspective than Mielitz on seniors setting debt.  ""I'm a fan of debt settlement when it's done right,"" Tayne says. ""By reducing and eliminating the debt sooner and with a smaller, more manageable budget, seniors can improve their financial situations."" Tayne says her firm has often found that seniors don't need to worry about credit, so the downsides to debt settlement are minimized. In turn, debt settlement may be the perfect option if you don't plan on applying for a home or auto loan anytime soon. If you're a homeowner, consolidating your high-interest debt with funds from a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or home equity loan could make sense. Both options generally provide lower rates than credit cards and traditional debt consolidation loans, so these equity-tapping options could be ideal for consolidating debt. ""Using your home equity can be a good move, but only if you don't use it repeatedly to get out of debt,"" says Edna Forero, a ChFc and EA based in Jupiter, Florida. Mielitz says to weigh the potential risks of using your home equity to pay down your credit cards or other debts before taking this route, though. After all, missing a payment on a HELOC or home equity loan can lead to losing your home. Another way to tap your home equity to consolidate debt is to take out a reverse mortgage. Unlike a traditional mortgage, with a reverse mortgage, the lender pays you a lump sum or monthly payments. What's unique is that a reverse mortgage loan does not require you to make monthly payments like a traditional loan does. Rather, the loan is paid back, with interest, when you sell the home or die. But while a reverse mortgage provides cash that can be used to consolidate and pay down debt, there are some downsides to consider with this option.  ""Closing costs alone could exceed the debt owed,"" says Tayne.  Tayne recommends reviewing your budget and expenses first to determine whether it's possible to reduce the debt another way rather than converting it into longer-term debt with a reverse mortgage. As a senior, there are plenty of options for consolidating credit card debt or other high-interest debt. If you have good credit and can comfortably afford the monthly payments, for example, it may be smart to consolidate your high-interest debt with a debt consolidation or home equity loan. But if you don't qualify for a debt consolidation loan option and can't afford to make minimum payments, contacting a debt relief company could make sense.

93,,Woman who made maps for D-Day landings gets France's top honor,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/d-day-anniversary-christian-lamb-france-honor/,It's been 80 years since Christian Lamb helped rescue France from Nazi tyranny.,2024-06-07T19:03:13Z,"
June 7, 2024 / 3:03 PM EDT
          / AP
         Eighty years after Christian Lamb helped rescue France from Nazi tyranny, French President Emmanuel Macron kissed her on both cheeks and pinned the nation's highest honor to her lapel. Lamb spent the months before D-Day alone in a tiny room in central London drawing the detailed maps that guided landing craft to the beaches of Normandy as Allied forces began their invasion of occupied France on June 6, 1944. The work was so secret she didn't even tell her husband. Now 103 and seated in a wheelchair, Lamb took center stage Thursday when Macron awarded her the Legion of Honor during British ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. ""You were, in your own way, among those figures in the shadow of D-Day,"" Macron told her. ""You were not there in person but you guided each step they took."" ""You have set us an example which we'll not forget,"" he added. By the time of the Normandy landings, Lamb had been doing her part to defeat the Nazis for almost five years as member of the Women's Royal Naval Service, known as the Wrens. While the history of D-Day is often told through the stories of the men who fought and died on the beaches, hundreds of thousands of military women worked behind the scenes in crucial non-combat roles such as codebreakers, ship plotters, radar operators and cartographers.  The contributions of women like Lamb, radio operator Marie Scott and Pat Owtram, whose work helped crack previously unbreakable Nazi codes, have come into sharper focus as the number of living D-Day veterans dwindles. All three have been awarded the Legion of Honor as the French government offers its gratitude to those who helped liberate the country during World War II. As D-Day approached, Lamb was assigned the task of creating charts for the landing craft crews who would deliver troops to the Normandy beaches. Referring to huge maps of the French coast pinned to the wall of her tiny office, the young Women's Royal Naval Service officer painstakingly created maps that highlighted every landmark to help crews get their bearings. The maps ""showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,"" Lamb told The Associated Press in a recent interview. ""It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate."" Lamb recalled the tension as everyone around her prepared for Operation Overlord, the long-awaited invasion of Europe that eventually ended the Nazis' grip on the continent. Passing Prime Minister Winston Churchill on the stairs on her way to work, she worried about the pressure he was facing. Recalling those days, her eyes glistened as she spoke about the way Churchill inspired the nation. ""He made these speeches which everybody listened to,"" she said. ""And I could hear him now saying, 'We'll fight on the beaches, fight in the hills. We'll never surrender.' We all felt just like that.""  Lamb's career in the Wrens began shortly after war broke out in the summer of 1939.  One of her assignments was as a plotting officer at Portsmouth, the home of the Royal Navy. Lamb was part of a team of Wrens who used information from radar stations and coast guards to plot ship movements through the English Channel on a large flat table. She later took on a similar role in Belfast, plotting the movements of convoys that carried supplies from North America. That included staffing her post as the news came in that a convoy escorted by her future husband's ship, the destroyer HMS Oribi, had been attacked by a U-boat wolf pack. Twelve of the convoy's 43 ships were lost, but HMS Oribi made it safely to Newfoundland. The couple were married six months later in December 1943. Lamb said she had a special resolve to help drive the Nazis out of France, particularly the centers of art and culture like Caen and Bayeux, where she had studied before the war. ""I really wanted (to do) anything that would help me to get … France back to the French,"" she said. ""We wanted them to belong to each other again."" In a 2007 book about her wartime experiences, Lamb joked that she only joined the Wrens because of their tricorne hats, which she thought ""splendid.""  She lost hers a long time ago.  But now she has a magnificent decoration with a bright red ribbon to replace it.

         The new KP.3 variant has climbed to 1 in 4 new COVID-19 cases nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated Friday, making it now the dominant strain of the virus nationwide.  KP.3's ascent comes as the CDC has tracked key metrics of spread from the virus now starting to trend up. Previous years have seen surges of the virus peak around August. Data from CDC's wastewater surveillance has tracked levels of the virus starting to accelerate in the West. Emergency room visits for COVID-19 have inched up in recent weeks for all ages. COVID-19 infections are likely growing in 30 states and territories, the CDC now estimates. KP.3 is now estimated to be outpacing the KP.2 variant, a so-called ""FLiRT"" strain that this week inched up to 22.5% of cases. KP.2 had risen to dominance in previous weeks, but its growth has now slowed. Both KP.3 and KP.2 are ""very, very similar"" to the JN.1 variant that had dominated this past winter's wave of infections. ""When you look at KP.2 and KP.3, they're nearly identical to each other with really one difference between the two of them,"" Natalie Thornburg, the chief lab official at the CDC's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division, said Wednesday. Thornburg was speaking at a Food and Drug Administration meeting debating what strains should be targeted by this fall's vaccines. This difference is smaller than previous jumps in the virus, like when JN.1's parent – the highly mutated BA.2.86 variant – first emerged last year. However, KP.2 and KP.3 are also not identical. Early data suggests KP.3's mutations might be better at evading immunity. ""JN.1 and KP.2-like viruses, they're really, really on top of each other. And KP.3 is very close, but not absolutely on top of it,"" Thornburg said. KP.3's rise comes as the FDA said Friday that it had decided to call for shots this fall to be updated for the JN.1 variant that was dominant earlier this year, effectively turning down a newer formula aimed at the KP.2 variant. ""Yes, we always say we shouldn't be chasing strains, but we're paying an incredibly high premium for mRNA vaccines to be able to have the freshest vaccines,"" the FDA's Peter Marks had told the meeting. Moderna had presented data from animal studies suggesting its KP.2-targeted shot offered similar protection against the latest variants, compared to a shot designed for JN.1. Pfizer's shot for KP.2 triggered better antibody responses for JN.1 variants, including KP.3. ""If this evolves further in the fall, will we regret not having been a little bit closer,"" Marks said. But the FDA ultimately decided to pass on the KP.2 shots, after the agency's advisers worried it might not do a better job at broadening immunity for future strains compared to JN.1. Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau. He covers the Biden administration's public health agencies, including the federal response to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

         Weddings are meant to be fun, joyous occasions, but the financial aspects of getting married can be stressful. Planning for the big day is also getting more difficult as inflation continues to put pressure on Americans' budgets. For example, the average cost of a wedding in the US was $35,000 in 2023, an increase of $5,000 from the year prior, according to The Knot. And, finding room in the budget to cover this amount isn't easy for many people.  While about half save up for a wedding in advance, nearly a third say they're optimizing credit cards to pay for a wedding in 2024, according to a survey from Zola. In some cases that means using credit card points to cover costs, but it can also mean other things like opening new credit cards, which can be an expensive way to pay for a wedding. After all, the average credit card interest rate is over 21%, according to the Federal Reserve. But ne possible way to finance a wedding at a lower interest rate is to use your home equity. While credit card rates average in the double digits, the average home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates are between about 8% and 9% currently. But even at that comparatively low rate, does it make sense to borrow against your home's equity to pay for a wedding?  Find out how affordable the right home equity loan could be today. Experts generally caution against using your home equity to cover wedding expenses, as you're not only taking on debt but are putting your home up as collateral for the financing. ""In doing so, you would basically be putting your house — the largest asset most people have — on the line, which is not smart,"" says Michael Micheletti, chief communications officer at Unlock Technologies. That said, there are times when it could make sense to use your home equity to pay for a wedding — and times when you shouldn't. Here's what you should know. If you're determined to borrow money to pay for a wedding, there can be situations where using home equity might make sense above other options, like using multiple credit cards. For example, ""a HELOC offers the advantage of paying from one source vs. taking out different loans or borrowing from family. But be mindful of the new monthly payment, as going into a marriage with additional debt might cause some stressors,"" says Rose Krieger, senior home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage. Also, borrowing from multiple sources — like using several credit cards and taking out a personal loan — could hurt your credit more than if you just opened one new account by borrowing from your home equity, says Krieger. Borrowing against your home equity to pay for a wedding could also make sense in situations where you're able to quickly pay off the loan without hurting your finances. ""It could potentially work if the borrower has a tremendous amount of equity in their home, and they plan on selling the home for a profit. They may intend to buy another home for a much lower price. If that's the case, the equity in the home could pay for the wedding without a decade of payments to follow,"" says Don Grant, a CFP Board ambassador. Similarly, there could be circumstances where you don't lose any money by borrowing if you can earn more on your cash elsewhere. If the home equity interest rate is lower than the risk-free rate of return — often considered to be the 10-year Treasury rate — and the loan can be paid off in under 12 months, it could make sense, says Nicky Amore, a CFP Board ambassador.  However, this is rare, and Amore generally does not think using home equity to pay for a wedding is in your best interest. Compare your home equity loan options and get started on a preapproval now. While using your home equity to pay for wedding costs sometimes works out, in many cases, it's unnecessary to put yourself in debt like this. ""This is one of those situations whereby I need to tell my client what they need to hear, not what they may want to hear,"" says Grant. While some debt enables you to potentially improve your finances, such as taking out a mortgage for a house that might appreciate in value, one-time events, like weddings, generally don't provide the same benefit. ""When a home is leveraged to raise money for a use that does not grow in value or create future revenue, it places the borrower at risk of potentially losing their home if there were a job loss or other financial emergency. That is not the way a couple should position themselves at the beginning of a lifetime relationship,"" says Grant. You might be digging yourself a hole, even if you get lots of monetary wedding gifts to help offset the borrowing costs — especially when accounting for the fees and initial interest costs of taking out a home equity loan or HELOC.  Plus, you could face additional costs due to tapping into your home equity, such as if a market downturn then causes your equity to fall below 20%, which could require you to add private mortgage insurance (PMI), notes Grant. Using your home equity to pay for a wedding can be risky and expensive, even if there are interest rate cuts that bring down financing costs in the future. However, there are occasionally situations in which it makes sense or is at least better than alternatives, like racking up wedding expenses on your credit card without paying the card off each month.

Walking back to the lobby, he saw the surgeon who was to perform the C-section about to step into a cab. He ran to him and practically grabbed the doctor by the lapels. ""What happened?"" ""What do you mean, what happened?""  ""My wife! Is she all right?"" ""Which one is your wife?""  ""Lenny Dunne, for God's sake!"" ""Oh, Mr. Dunne, my apologies, didn't anyone tell you?""  ""Tell me what?"" ""We did the C-section hours ago. She's fine. Baby's fine. Someone should have told you, but it's been a crazy day. I've done three since."" More relieved than pissed, Dad let the man get in his taxi. Before it pulled away from the curb, the doctor yelled out the window, ""Oh, and don't worry about the foot!"" On the long walk back to the maternity ward, Dad pictured me growing up in a wheelchair or with a prosthetic leg, but while my right foot did curl inward when I was a newborn, it turned itself out by the time I could walk. From the moment I was born, my father told me I was always trying to get somewhere else. My first word was taxi. I had a toy suitcase that I'd carry around the living room and raise my hand to hail a cab, yelling, ""Taxi, taxi,"" as if late for an important meeting. Elizabeth Montgomery, who later played Samantha in Bewitched, was my first babysitter. She was a struggling actress with a small part in Late Love when she met my mother, and though Elizabeth was her employee, my mother and she became close friends. Elizabeth once told her, while changing my diapers, that I had a bigger dick than her husband. That marriage was, needless to say, short-lived. There is a kinescope from an early episode of the Today show in which Arlene Francis, also from the cast of Late Love, interviews my mother, billed as the ""typical New York housewife,"" while a camera follows her on a routine day. (The daughter of a rancher who went to Miss Porter's was hardly a relatable housewife, but somehow Dad got her the gig through his connections at NBC.) There wasn't much content in the early days of morning talk shows, so this segment is a mundane, fifteen-minute blow-by-blow of the life of a young family. It begins with Dad heading to work like a character out of a John Cheever story, while Mom does household chores, runs errands, and takes me to Central Park to feed the ducks. At one point in the clip, she enters a shoe store on Lexington Avenue and leaves me in my pram on the sidewalk, as if we lived in Grover's Corners. When she tries to lay me down in my crib at the end of the day, I nuzzle into her neck, not wanting her to leave. Anyone tuning in that morning would have seen a little boy who loved his mother more than anything in the world. When the camera cuts back to Mom in the studio, having just watched the segment she narrated, she looks lost in the moment, as if still savoring my affection. Arlene Francis ends the interview by saying to her viewers, ""We wish Lenny, Nick, and Griffin all the luck in the world as they begin their bright future."" As it turned out, we were going to need it.       An excerpt from ""The Friday Afternoon Club,"" published by Penguin Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.

         The Paris Olympics organizers on Friday unveiled a display of the five Olympic rings mounted on the Eiffel Tower as the French capital marks 50 days until the start of the Summer Games. The structure of rings, made of recycled French steel, was displayed on the south side of the 135-year-old landmark in central Paris, overlooking the Seine River. Each ring is  30 feet in diameter. Thousands of athletes will parade through the heart of the French capital on boats on the Seine along a 3.7-mile route in the opening ceremony at sunset on July 26. There will be no shortage of iconic venues at the Paris Olympics. The tower, nicknamed La Dame de Fer (The Iron Lady), will feature prominently in the July 26-Aug. 11 Paris Games and the following Paralympics. Men's and women's volleyball players will compete at the foot of the 330-meter (1,083-foot) monument. They will be watched by nearly 13,000 fans at the temporary Eiffel Tower Stadium on the nearby Champ de Mars, where Parisians and tourists like to have picnics on the grass or watch July 14 firework displays. The Olympic and Paralympic medals in Paris are being embedded with pieces from a hexagonal chunk of iron taken from the tower. The hugely popular landmark in central Paris has seen soaring visitor numbers in the leadup to the 2024 Games. Two huge cranes were used overnight Friday to lift the 30-ton structure and mount it between the first and second floors of the tower. The Olympic rings will be illuminated every night with 100,000 LED bulbs through the Paralympic Games that start Aug. 28, 17 days after the Olympics' closing ceremony. The Paralympics will bring together 4,400 athletes from 180 countries in 549 events and 22 sports. Many sports will take place near landmarks including the Eiffel Tower, Versailles and the Grand Palais.

         A local councilwoman was gunned down Friday as she was leaving her home in the southern state of Guerrero, authorities and local media said, marking the second female politician to be killed in Mexico after Claudia Sheinbaum became the first woman to win the country's presidency last week.  Esmeralda Garzon, a councilwoman in the municipality of Tixtla, was shot dead as she was leaving her house, local media reported. The Guerrero state attorney general's office said in a statement that police were sent to the scene to gather evidence and find those responsible for the shooting. Garzon, who led the equity and gender commission in Tixtla, had been elected under the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the Reuters news agency reported. However, she eventually backed Sheinbaum's Morena party in the June 2 elections, according to posts on social media. Garzon herself was not running in the elections.

Yolanda Sanchez Figueroa was killed just hours after Sheinbaum won the presidency. At least 23 political candidates were killed while campaigning before the elections, according to official statistics, marking the most violent elections in modern Mexican history, according to Reuters. But some non-governmental organizations have reported an even higher toll, including Data Civica, which counted at least 30 killings of candidates. The toll increases to more than 50 people if relatives and other victims of those attacks are counted, according to Data Civica. A few days before the elections, one mayoral hopeful's murder was captured on camera -- an assassination that came just one day after another mayoral candidate in the central Mexican state of Morelos was murdered. The week before that, nine people were killed in two attacks against mayoral candidates in the southern state of Chiapas. The two candidates survived. Last month, six people, including a minor and mayoral candidate Lucero Lopez, were killed in an ambush after a campaign rally in the municipality of La Concordia, neighboring Villa Corzo. In April, one mayoral hopeful was shot dead just hours after she began campaigning.
