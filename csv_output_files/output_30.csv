0,Boone Ashworth,Things Keep Getting Worse for the Humane Ai Pin,https://www.wired.com/story/things-keep-getting-worse-for-the-humane-ai-pin/,"Plus: Wilson Audio revamps its iconic speakers, Elon continues to Elon, and Google’s AI overviews are already causing chaos.",2024-06-08T12:00:00Z,"Boone Ashworth It has not been a great year for the Humane Ai pin. Pitched to the world as an AI-infused hologram-projecting phone replacement you could stick on your lapel, the wearable pin instead turned out to be a sad, bad little device. After months of hype, the Pin was finally released to widespread disdain from critics who cited an array of faults—like the fact that the $700 smart gadget lacked key features and overheated easily and that its touted projector simply wasn’t visible in daylight. Just a few weeks after the pin came out, Humane’s leadership was looking to sell the company off. This week, that somber saga has gotten even worse for the weary wearable. The New York Times published a story detailing many of the messy, chaotic decisions behind the scenes at Humane that led to such a flawed product being released into the wild. Chief among the problems were that the company knew the battery didn’t last long and that the device’s laser display got so hot that staff had to put ice packs on it to cool it down. (A day before the NYT story came out, The Verge reported that Humane sent emails to its customers warning them to stop using the charging case that came with the pin because they’re at risk of catching on fire.) There’s also the fact that leadership didn’t listen to internal criticism that may have led to someone pointing out the myriad ways in which the device simply did not work. According to The Times, Humane sold roughly 10,000 devices, less than 10 percent of its goal for an initial run. Here’s some happier news from the consumer tech world this week. The 2024 edition of Wilson Audio's WATT/Puppy speakers Wilson Audio is bringing back its iconic, Dalek-shaped WATT/Puppy speakers to exterminate your ears, your eyes, and your wallet. Originally designed in 1985 by company founder David Wilson as a way to replicate the sound of his custom studio speakers in a more portable arrangement, each of these shapely boxes packs four drivers into two stacked cabinets. The top part (the WATT) holds a convergent synergy carbon tweeter and a 7-inch alnico midrange driver, while the bottom part (the Puppy) holds a pair of 8-inch cellulose composite woofers. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Each speaker combo is about 42 inches tall. This new iteration of the WATT/Puppy is the first redesign of the speakers since 2011. They ain’t cheap though, and cost more than $53,000 for a pair (£41,998 if you speak British). You can customize individual parts of the speakers, like the grille colors and hardware bits, making it possible to put together a variety of distinctive-looking sets. You can also install spikes on the feet for near-total vibrational isolation—which should keep the sound from getting flabby when Walter Becker hits the lowest notes on your 180-gram audiophile vinyl Aja remaster. Elon Musk really likes money. Or at least that’s what you might assume seeing as he is currently in a fight to secure $56 billion as a salary for staying on as CEO of the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. On June 13, Tesla shareholders will vote to approve the gargantuan paycheck for the world’s richest man. It’s been a tense row, with the chair of Tesla’s board calling for shareholders to approve the money lest Musk leave for, well, greener endeavors. And—surprise, surprise—Musk has been shit-talking Tesla shareholders who say they will vote against the pricey package. In other Elon adventures, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk diverted a shipment of Nvidia AI chips away from Tesla and had them sent to facilities of his other pet project, the social site formerly known as Twitter. (Now stupidly known as X.) As Google is wont to do these days, the company's latest AI ambitions have yet again riled up people online. AI Overviews are Google's newish written summaries that appear at the top of a results page on some Google searches. The goal is to present a short, easily readable answer to a searcher's question in an instant. In reality, those answers are sometimes completely wrong or misleading. Not only that, but giving searchers an immediate answer without them having to click on any links creates an all but existential crisis for websites that depend on people going to their page. Like, you know, every journalistic publication out there. This week on the Gadget Lab podcast, WIRED writers Kate Knibbs and Reece Rogers join the show to talk about how AI overviews are changing how we find information online, how Google has managed the feature’s rollout, and what happens when the overviews start stealing what you've written."
1,Steven Levy,Don’t Let Mistrust of Tech Companies Blind You to the Power of AI,https://www.wired.com/story/dont-let-mistrust-of-tech-companies-blind-you-power-of-ai/,It’s OK to be doubtful of tech leaders’ grandiose visions of our AI future—but that doesn’t mean the technology won’t have a huge impact.,2024-06-07T13:00:00Z,"By Steven Levy It seems evident to me that almost 70 years after the first conference on artificial intelligence—where the nascent field’s leaders suggested the task would be completed within a decade—the field is now poised to make a transformational impact on our lives. We don’t need to reach artificial general intelligence, or AGI, whatever that means, for this to happen. I wrote as much in this column three weeks ago, citing evidence that after the astonishing leap of large language models that gave us ChatGPT, the advancements had not “plateaued” as some critics were charging. I also disagreed with the wave of skeptics claiming that what looked amazing in OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3, Meta’s Llama 3, and an armada of Microsoft Copilots was merely a linguistic variation of a card trick. The hype, I insisted, is justified. It turns out that conclusion is anything but evident to lots of people. The pushback was immediate and furious. My rather neutral tweet about the column was viewed over 29 million times, and lots of those eyeballs were shooting death lasers at me. I received hundreds of comments, and though a good number expressed agreement, the vast majority were negative and expressed disagreement in an impolite manner. The attacks came from several camps. First were those disparaging the advance of AI itself, claiming I was a lousy journalist for blindly accepting the fake narrative of the tech companies pushing AI. “This is a shill, nothing more,” said one commenter. Another said, “You’re parroting the lies put forth by those scam artists.” After Google released its AI Overview search feature, which was prone to jaw-dropping errors, my responders seized on its mistakes as proof that there was no there in generative AI. “Enjoy your pizza with extra glue,” someone advised me. Others used the opportunity to decry the dangers of AI, though this stance affirms my observation that AI is a big deal. “So was the Atom Bomb,” said one tweeter. “How did that work out?” One contingent condemned LLMs because they trained on copyrighted material. This is a valid criticism but doesn’t diminish what these models can do. My favorite response was from someone who cited the example I used of an LLM passing the bar exam with high marks. “Passing the bar exam is something DeepMind could do back when it did well at Jeapordy [sic],” said this detractor. The Jeopardy! computer was actually IBM’s Watson—DeepMind was just an embryonic startup then—and was carefully optimized to play that TV game. Since the bar exam isn’t conducted in a format that requires candidates to provide the questions to go with supplied answers, it’s ridiculous to think that Watson could have passed. The wrongness of that sentence is something that even the most hallucinogenic LLM would be hard-pressed to match! When I asked several LLM models whether the Watson computer could have passed the bar exam, all of them carefully and correctly explained why not. Chalk one up to the robots. Putting aside the disrespectful tone of the responses—that’s just the way things roll on X—I find the reaction understandable but misguided. We’re in a period of latency, where users are only beginning to figure out how to exploit the extraordinary products coming out of the AI companies. Forget about the dumb answers that AI Overviews and other LLMs can produce (but remember that Google has no monopoly on hallucinations). The big tech companies have made a conscious decision to push less-than-fully-baked products into the marketplace, in part because it’s the best way to find out how to improve them and in part because the competition is so intense that none of the companies can afford to slow down. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Meanwhile, in less visible ways, AI is already changing education, commerce, and the workplace. One friend recently told me about a big IT firm he works with. The company had a lengthy and long-established protocol for launching major initiatives that involved designing solutions, coding up the product, and engineering the rollout. Moving from concept to execution took months. But he recently saw a demo that applied state-of-the-art AI to a typical software project. “All of those things that took months happened in the space of a few hours,” he says. “That made me agree with your column. Tons of the companies that surround us are now animated corpses.” No wonder people are freaked. What fuels a lot of the rage against AI is mistrust of the companies building and promoting it. By coincidence I had a breakfast scheduled this week with Ali Farhadi, the CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, a nonprofit research effort. He’s 100 percent convinced that the hype is justified but also empathizes with those who don’t accept it—because, he says, the companies that are trying to dominate the field are viewed with suspicion by the public. “AI has been treated as this black box thing that no one knows about, and it’s so expensive only four companies can do it,” Farhadi says. The fact that AI developers are moving so quickly fuels the distrust even more. “We collectively don’t understand this, yet we’re deploying it,” he says. “I’m not against that, but we should expect these systems will behave in unpredictable ways, and people will react to that.” Fahadi, who is a proponent of open source AI, says that at the least the big companies should publicly disclose what materials they use to train their models. Compounding the issue is that many people involved in building AI also pledge their devotion to producing AGI. While many key researchers believe this will be a boon to humanity—it's the founding principle of OpenAI—they have not made the case to the public. “People are frustrated with the notion that this AGI thing is going to come tomorrow or one year or in six months,” says Farhadi, who is not a fan of the concept. He says AGI is not a scientific term but a fuzzy notion that’s mucking up the adoption of AI. “In my lab when a student uses those three letters, it just delays their graduation by six months,” he says. Personally I’m agnostic on the AGI issue—I don’t think we’re on the cusp of it but simply don’t know what will happen in the long run. When you talk to people on the front lines of AI, it turns out that they don’t know, either. Some things do seem clear to me, and I think that these will eventually become apparent to all—even those pitching spitballs at me on X. AI will get more powerful. People will find ways to use it to make their jobs and personal lives easier. Also, many folks are going to lose their jobs, and entire companies will be disrupted. It will be small consolation that new jobs and firms might emerge from an AI boom, because some of the displaced people will still be stuck in unemployment lines or cashiering at Walmart. In the meantime, everyone in the AI world—including columnists like me—would do well to understand why people are so enraged, and respect their justifiable discontent. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Invoking the 1956 AI conference in Dartmouth brings to mind Marvin Minsky, an unforgettable human mind. Upon his death in 2016, I wondered whether even the most advanced AI could ever match the meat inside his head. It’s a scary thought. There was a great contradiction about Marvin Minsky. As one of the creators of artificial intelligence (with John McCarthy), he believed as early as the 1950s that computers would have human-like cognition. But Marvin himself was an example of an intelligence so bountiful, unpredictable and sublime that not even a million Singularities could conceivably produce a machine with a mind to match his. At the least, it is beyond my imagination to conceive of that happening. But maybe Marvin could imagine it. His imagination respected no borders … I was dazzled by Minsky, an impish man of clear importance whose every other utterance was a rabbit’s hole of profundity and puzzlement. He’d been a professor at MIT since 1958, had invented stuff like the head mounted display, and besides AI, had done pioneering work in neural nets and robotics. But even had he done nothing, the blinding brilliance of his conversation, leavened by the humor of a lighthearted borscht belt comic, would have cemented a legacy. He questioned everything, and his observations were quirky, innovative, and made such perfect sense that you wonder why no one else had thought of them. After a couple of hours with him, your own vision of the world was altered. Only years later did I realize that his everyday Minsky-ness imparted a basic lesson: if you saw the world the way everybody else did, how smart could you really be? Mark asks, “What does tech have to worry about in another Trump term?” Thanks for asking, Mark. I’ll avoid making general remarks about what everyone has to worry about in another Trump term and concentrate on the question at hand. The climate for tech after a Trump victory is more complicated now that a number of super-rich Silicon Valley tech figures are supporting the former president—felony conviction notwithstanding. This week, tech billionaires Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks hosted a sold-out Trump fundraiser, which charged $300,000 to join the “host committee” and stay for dinner, and $50,000 to attend just the reception. Elon Musk is reportedly angling to be Trump’s tech adviser in a second term. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Clearly some tech people aren’t worried about Trump. Indeed, his return to the White House might actually be a short-term boon for some of the biggest companies. Trump would almost certainly reverse the Biden administration’s hard line toward regulation and antitrust prosecution. (Bye-bye, net neutrality. Hello, giant acquisitions by tech companies.) But there would be plenty for tech to worry about, too. Trump has a well-documented history of rewarding his supporters and punishing those who don’t bend the knee. Remember how he tried to steer TikTok to Oracle, run by his booster Larry Ellison? Tech works best as a meritocracy—crony capitalism would be counterproductive for the industry. The first Trump administration never got around to big infrastructure investments—would it now roll back Biden’s big grants in chip manufacturing? We might also see a drift in tech policy: The Biden White House has issued a detailed order on artificial intelligence that includes close scrutiny of the technology's potential downsides and security risks. Would Trump unwind it all? (He hasn’t talked much about AI on the campaign trail.) Ultimately the smartest tech executives in big companies would figure out how to appease Trump. But long-term, a dwindling of public investment and research and the rise of a crony-based system might well weaken the US tech industry. Oh, and expect Trump to mandate that all government communications should be conducted on Truth Social. Just kidding. I think. You can submit questions to mail@wired.com. Write ASK LEVY in the subject line. It’s not even summer yet, and the highs in India are topping 120 degrees Fahrenheit. So maybe it’s not so bad that it’s 110 degrees in Phoenix.

How one California town sent drones to answer 911 calls—at a possible cost of the privacy of those living in poorer neighborhoods.

2,"Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica",Each of the Past 12 Months Broke Temperature Records,https://www.wired.com/story/record-temperature-months-full-year/,Last June was the warmest in recorded history. It kicked off an alarming streak with no end in sight.,2024-06-07T19:00:00Z,"Jon Brodkin, Ars Technica June 2023 did not seem like an exceptional month at the time. It was the warmest June in the instrumental temperature record, but monthly records haven't exactly been unusual in a period where the top 10 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 15 years. And monthly records have often occurred in years that are otherwise unexceptional; at the time, the warmest July on record had occurred in 2019, a year that doesn't stand out much from the rest of the past decade. But July 2023 set another monthly record, easily eclipsing 2019's high temperatures. Then August set yet another monthly record. And so has every single month since—a string of records that propelled 2023 to being the warmest year since tracking started. On Wednesday, the European Union's Earth-monitoring service, Copernicus, announced that it has now been a full year where every month has been the warmest version of that month since there's been enough instruments in place to track global temperatures. As you can see from this graph, most years feature a mix of temperatures—some higher than average, some lower. Exceptionally high months tend to cluster, but those clusters also tend to be shorter than a full year. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. In the Copernicus data, a similar yearlong streak of records happened once before, in 2015/2016. NASA, which uses slightly different data and methods, doesn't show a similar streak in that earlier period. NASA hasn't released its results for May's temperatures yet—they're expected in the next few days—but it's very likely that the results will also show a yearlong streak of records. Beyond records, the EU is highlighting the fact that the one-year period ending in May was 1.63 degrees Celsius above the average temperatures of the 1850–1900 period, which is used as a baseline for preindustrial temperatures. That's notable because many countries have ostensibly pledged to try to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial conditions by the end of the century. While it's likely that temperatures will drop below the target again at some point within the next few years, the new records suggest that we have a very limited amount of time before temperatures persistently exceed it. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Realistically, those plans involve overshooting the 1.5 degrees target by midcentury but using carbon capture technology to draw down greenhouse gas levels. Exceeding that target earlier will mean that we have more carbon dioxide to pull out of the atmosphere, using technology that hasn't been demonstrated to be anywhere close to the scale we'll need. Plus, it's unclear who will pay for the carbon removal. The extremity of some of the monthly records—some months have come in at a half-degree Celsius above any earlier month—are also causing scientists to look for reasons behind the surge. But so far, the field hasn't come to a consensus. Because these temperature extremes have been accompanied by significant warming of ocean temperatures, a lot of attention has focused on changes to pollution rules for international shipping, which are meant to reduce sulfur emissions. These went into effect recently and have cut down on the emission of aerosols by cargo vessels, reducing the amount of sunlight that's reflected back to space. That's considered to likely be a partial contributor to temperature changes. A slight contribution may have also come from the Hunga Tonga eruption, which blasted significant amounts of water vapor into the upper atmosphere—though nowhere near enough to explain this warming. Beyond that, there are no obvious explanations for the recent warmth. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica."
3,Steve Nadis,How Game Theory Can Make AI More Reliable,https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-can-make-ai-more-correct-and-efficient/,"Researchers are drawing on ideas from game theory to improve large language models and make them more correct, efficient, and consistent.",2024-06-09T11:00:00Z,"Steve Nadis The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. Imagine you had a friend who gave different answers to the same question, depending on how you asked it. “What’s the capital of Peru?” would get one answer, and “Is Lima the capital of Peru?” would get another. You’d probably be a little worried about your friend’s mental faculties, and you’d almost certainly find it hard to trust any answer they gave. That’s exactly what’s happening with many large language models (LLMs), the ultra-powerful machine learning tools that power ChatGPT and other marvels of artificial intelligence. A generative question, which is open-ended, yields one answer, and a discriminative question, which involves having to choose between options, often yields a different one. “There is a disconnect when the same question is phrased differently,” said Athul Paul Jacob, a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. To make a language model’s answers more consistent—and make the model more reliable overall—Jacob and his colleagues devised a game where the model’s two modes are driven toward finding an answer they can agree on. Dubbed the consensus game, this simple procedure pits an LLM against itself, using the tools of game theory to improve the model’s accuracy and internal consistency. “Research exploring self-consistency within these models has been very limited,” said Shayegan Omidshafiei, chief scientific officer of the robotics company Field AI. “This paper is one of the first that tackles this, in a clever and systematic way, by creating a game for the language model to play with itself.” “It’s really exciting work,” added Ahmad Beirami, a research scientist at Google Research. For decades, he said, language models have generated responses to prompts in the same way. “With their novel idea of bringing a game into this process, the MIT researchers have introduced a totally different paradigm, which can potentially lead to a flurry of new applications.” The new work, which uses games to improve AI, stands in contrast to past approaches, which measured an AI program’s success via its mastery of games. In 1997, for example, IBM’s Deep Blue computer beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov—a milestone for so-called thinking machines. Nineteen years later, a Google DeepMind program named AlphaGo won four out of five games against former Go champion Lee Sedol, revealing another arena in which humans no longer reigned supreme. Machines have also surpassed humans in checkers, two-player poker, and other “zero-sum” games, in which the victory of one player invariably dooms the other. Athul Paul Jacob helped devise the consensus game, which provides a way for large language models to improve their accuracy and reliability. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Posing a far greater challenge for AI researchers was the game of Diplomacy—a favorite of politicians like John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger. Instead of just two opponents, the game features seven players whose motives can be hard to read. To win, a player must negotiate, forging cooperative arrangements that anyone could breach at any time. Diplomacy is so complex that a group from Meta was pleased when, in 2022, its AI program Cicero developed “human-level play” over the course of 40 games. While it did not vanquish the world champion, Cicero did well enough to place in the top 10 percent against human participants. During the project, Jacob—a member of the Meta team—was struck by the fact that Cicero relied on a language model to generate its dialog with other players. He sensed untapped potential. The team’s goal, he said, “was to build the best language model we could for the purposes of playing this game.” But what if instead they focused on building the best game they could to improve the performance of large language models? In 2023, Jacob began to pursue that question at MIT, working with Yikang Shen, Gabriele Farina, and his adviser, Jacob Andreas, on what would become the consensus game. The core idea came from imagining a conversation between two people as a cooperative game, where success occurs when a listener understands what a speaker is trying to convey. In particular, the consensus game is designed to align the language model’s two systems—the generator, which handles generative questions, and the discriminator, which handles discriminative ones. After a few months of stops and starts, the team built this principle up into a full game. First, the generator receives a question. It can come from a human or from a preexisting list. For example, “Where was Barack Obama born?” The generator then gets some candidate responses, let’s say Honolulu, Chicago, and Nairobi. Again, these options can come from a human, a list, or a search carried out by the language model itself. But before answering, the generator is also told whether it should answer the question correctly or incorrectly, depending on the results of a fair coin toss. If it’s heads, then the machine attempts to answer correctly. The generator sends the original question, along with its chosen response, to the discriminator. If the discriminator determines that the generator intentionally sent the correct response, they each get one point, as a kind of incentive. If the coin lands on tails, the generator sends what it thinks is the wrong answer. If the discriminator decides it was deliberately given the wrong response, they both get a point again. The idea here is to incentivize agreement. “It’s like teaching a dog a trick,” Jacob explained. “You give them a treat when they do the right thing.” The generator and discriminator also each start with some initial “beliefs.” These take the form of a probability distribution related to the different choices. For example, the generator may believe, based on the information it has gleaned from the internet, that there’s an 80 percent chance Obama was born in Honolulu, a 10 percent chance he was born in Chicago, a 5 percent chance of Nairobi, and a 5 percent chance of other places. The discriminator may start off with a different distribution. While the two “players” are still rewarded for reaching agreement, they also get docked points for deviating too far from their original convictions. That arrangement encourages the players to incorporate their knowledge of the world—again drawn from the internet—into their responses, which should make the model more accurate. Without something like this, they might agree on a totally wrong answer like Delhi, but still rack up points. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams For each question, the two systems play roughly 1,000 games against each other. Over the course of these numerous iterations, each side learns about the other’s beliefs and modifies its strategies accordingly. Eventually, the generator and the discriminator begin to agree more as they settle into something called Nash equilibrium. This is arguably the central concept in game theory. It represents a kind of balance in a game—the point at which no players can better their personal outcomes by shifting strategies. In rock-paper-scissors, for example, players do best when they choose each of the three options exactly one-third of the time, and they will invariably do worse with any other tactic. In the consensus game, this can play out in many ways. The discriminator might observe that it gets a point when it says “correct” every time the generator sends the word “Honolulu” for Obama’s birthplace. The generator and discriminator will learn, after repeated play, that they will be rewarded for continuing to do this, and neither will have any motivation to do anything else. this consensus represents one of many possible examples of Nash equilibrium for this question. The MIT group also relied on a modified form of Nash equilibrium that incorporates the players’ prior beliefs, which helps keep their responses grounded in reality. The net effect, the researchers observed, is to make the language model playing this game more accurate and more likely to give the same answer, no matter how the question is asked. To test the effects of the consensus game, the team tried out a set of standard questions on various moderate-size language models with 7 billion to 13 billion parameters. These models routinely got a higher percentage of correct responses than models that hadn’t played, even much bigger ones with up to 540 billion parameters. Playing the game also improved a model’s internal consistency. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams In principle, any LLM could benefit from playing the game against itself, and 1,000 rounds would take only a few milliseconds on a standard laptop. “A nice benefit of the overall approach,” Omidshafiei said, “is that it’s computationally very lightweight, involving no training or modification of the base language model.” After this initial success, Jacob is now investigating other ways of bringing game theory into LLM research. Preliminary results have shown that an already strong LLM can further improve by playing a different game—tentatively called the ensemble game—with an arbitrary number of smaller models. The primary LLM would have at least one smaller model serving as an ally and at least one smaller model playing an adversarial role. If the primary LLM is asked to name the president of the United States, it gets a point whenever it chooses the same answer as its ally, and it also gets a point when it chooses a different answer than its adversary’s. These interactions with much smaller models can not only boost an LLM’s performance, tests suggest, but can do so without extra training or parameter changes. Ian Gemp brings game theory into real-world settings, which can enable large language models to help in strategic situations. And that is just the start. Because a variety of situations can be viewed as games, the tools from game theory can be brought into play in various real-world settings, said Ian Gemp, a research scientist at Google DeepMind. In a February 2024 paper, he and colleagues focused on negotiation scenarios that require more elaborate exchanges than just questions and answers. “The main objective of this project is to make language models more strategic,” he said. One example he discussed at an academic conference is the paper review process for acceptance by a journal or conference, especially after one’s initial submission received a harsh review. Given that language models assign probabilities to different responses, researchers can construct game trees similar to those designed for poker games, which chart the available choices and their possible consequences. “Once you do this, you can start to compute Nash equilibria and then rank a bunch of rebuttals,” Gemp said. The model essentially tells you: This is what we think you should say back. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams With the benefit of game theory’s insights, language models will be able to handle even more sophisticated interactions, rather than being limited to question-and-answer-type problems. “The big payoff going forward has to do with longer conversations,” Andreas said. “The next step is to have an AI interact with a person, not just another language model.” Jacob views the DeepMind work as complementary to the consensus and ensemble games. “At a high level, both these methods are combining language models and game theory,” he said, even if the goals are somewhat different. While the Gemp group is casting commonplace situations into a game format to help with strategic decisionmaking, Jacob said, “we’re using what we know about game theory to improve language models in general tasks.” Right now, these efforts represent “two branches of the same tree,” Jacob said—two different ways to enhance the functioning of language models. “My vision is that in a year or two, these two branches will converge.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences."
4,Laurence Russell,The Indie Horror Game That Launched a Surprising Queer Hopepunk Revolution,https://www.wired.com/story/signalis-queer-fandom-revolution/,"""Signalis"" came out in 2022 to strong reviews but has mostly stayed under the radar. Two years later, it has amassed a following of women, nonbinary, and queer folks who have created a hopeful community based around its grimdark themes.",2024-06-14T11:30:00Z,"Laurence Russell In late 2022, 3D animator Elizabeth Caingcoy completed the unheralded indie horror game Signalis and needed to talk to someone. Immediately. “The game resonated with me so intensely it was like I had to scream from the rooftops,” she says. Over the next few months, she created a number of stunning fan animations celebrating the game, springboarding a new wave of appreciation among Signalis’ queer fandom. Caingcoy’s animations soon made their way to a fellow Southeast Asian 3D animator who creates under the name Atelier. Atelier became an even more prolific contributor to the community, establishing the fandom’s reputation as a place for women, nonbinary, and queer folks to find hope and connect. The community was small, but mighty—and growing. When it was released in 2022, Signalis picked up some awards and a few critical raves. But its most devoted players fell for it over time, desperate to unpack the feelings the game left them with. Its dark narrative hides a fragile, tragic lesbian romance that captivates all who discover it. Now, this fast-growing enclave has become notorious for celebrating the power of defiant queer love beyond the dystopian cosmic terror of Signalis itself. This devotion is evident in the numbers: In March, moderators of the game's subreddit surveyed more than 300 players and found that 38 percent identified as trans; 11 percent described themselves as questioning. Some 23 percent identified as gay or lesbian, 46 percent as bisexual or pansexual, and a further 20 percent recorded some kind of nonstraight answer. The question is, why has this eerie cocktail of cosmic horror and queerness struck such a chord? Developed by rose-engine, an indie studio in Hamburg, Germany, composed of just two developers, Yuri Stern and Barbara Wittmann, Signalis is a labor of love that was first conceived of more than 10 years ago. Most of its main characters are women looking for lost loved ones while being embattled by eldritch space terror. “Horror has a unique power to confront and dissect our deepest fears, allowing us to confront them in a controlled environment,” a cadre of Signalis’ Reddit and Discord mods told WIRED in a statement. “While romance can provide emotional catharsis, horror offers a different kind of release—one that allows us to confront our fears, even finding solace in the shared experience of terror.” Despite that, the community that has formed around Signalis embraces a hopepunk tone, choosing tenderness, resilience, and humor as its main themes. Fans have produced video essays with hundreds of thousands of views. Some 8,000 users populate its Discord, and its subreddit has collected more than 32,000 members. Beloved artists have drawn its characters. On April 28, the community produced a 97-page zine, created by a mostly female and nonbinary team. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Rose-Engine always had a fairly specific vision in mind for Signalis. The positive response to the prototypes spurred them on to create a distinctly refined experience. “We're happy that our game has resonated with a diverse community of fellow creative people,” Stern and Wittmann wrote in a statement to WIRED. “We're also incredibly thankful for all the beautiful fan art that has been created for the game.” Before playing Signalis, the pseudonymous artist Atelier had been an animator with 11 years of experience facing occupational burnout. “In many of those years I never got the chance to portray emotions like love, despite being queer myself and a fan of queer romance,” she explains. Having produced dozens of heartfelt and exhilarating shorts, Atelier describes a very intense passion for bringing the game to life. “I was creating so many in such a short time, the output was unbelievable,” she says. “I kept making more because there was so much that I wanted to show with Signalis’ characters.” The plight of Signalis’ “replikas,” the biosynthetic clones manufactured to emulate model workers and soldiers of an oppressive regime, particularly struck Caingcoy. “In spite of these rules, replikas make their own individuality, which has always moved me,” she says. “I relate to it heavily as a lesbian and trans woman, seeing myself as someone who had to claw myself out of an existence that wasn’t true to me.” “I relate to it heavily as a lesbian and trans woman, seeing myself as someone who had to claw myself out of an existence that wasn’t true to me.” Speculative genres allow people to consider boundaries between the normative and what gender theorist Judith Butler and others call the “constitutive outside,” allowing minoritized demographics to feel more seen, says Jennifer Dugan, an associate professor at the University of South-Eastern Norway who researches fan culture, specifically in relation to the trans experience. “I speculate that Signalis’ use of androids is a key reason why the game appeals to the trans population,” says Dugan, referencing Donna Haraway’s writings about cyborgs. Similarly, the horror themes speak to women because, as a genre, horror has long provided them with a way to reimagine their own troubling experiences. Grimdark fare, like that in Signalis, “allows for the translation of real-life trauma or pain into fantastical, metaphorical, heightened, or even just different terms,” says Erika Kvistad, an English professor at USEN who specializes in horror and sexuality. Fans invert these dark themes into hopeful creations like those from Caingcoy and Atelier to develop “a kind of familiarity or intimacy with the scary thing—not making it harmless, but getting close to it, creating a relationship. Horror and love can be closely related feelings,” Kvistad explains. Despite the game's release being more than a year ago, Signalis’ fandom appears to be growing as more of the people it was made for discover it. Community projects include a full fan dub and a multiplayer mod for the game, the Silicon Queen fanfic alternate universe, a visual novel fan game, and a Signalis tarot deck. Rose-Engine’s Wittmann and Stern say they enjoy the enthusiasm and creativity of the game’s fans. Mostly. “Our vision of the world of Signalis’ is different than that of many fans,” they write, “and we definitely do not endorse any fan interpretations and fan works that, for example, depict the characters overly sexualized, infantilized, consuming drugs, or acting homophobic, all of which we’ve sadly seen in the past.” They also note they “currently have no news to share” regarding future work, a sign that any new Signalis game could be far off. With layoffs, closures, and acquisitions peppering the modern games industry, it can seem unlikely for such an unbridled expression of creativity like Signalis to survive the churn of the development cycle. With small studios faltering, and the mundanity of triple-A titles as strong as ever, indie originality has never been more sorely craved. “Signalis moved me in ways I never expected it would have,” remarks Caingcoy. “I do hope that its popularity inspires more people to give more creators the budget to tell honest stories.” Updated: 6/16/2024, 5:45 pm ET: The team that worked on the Signalis zine was mostly women and nonbinary people."
5,"Aarian Marshall, Morgan Meaker",Tesla Shareholders Approve Elon Musk's Big Payday,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-pay-package-approved-tesla-shareholders/,Elon Musk will pocket $56 billion after Tesla shareholders made a show of support for his leadership.,2024-06-13T21:09:43Z,"Aarian Marshall Morgan Meaker Under CEO Elon Musk, Tesla has been credited with revolutionizing the auto industry, jump-starting the electric revolution, and racking up billions in profit in the process. Now Musk is set for a record payday worth around $50 billion, after the electric car company’s shareholders approved a compensation plan that had been previously blocked by a federal judge. The preliminary outcome of the vote was announced Thursday afternoon during an annual shareholder meeting at Tesla’s newest auto and battery factory in Austin, Texas. The setting was apropos: Shareholders also approved a measure to move Tesla’s corporate registration away from Delaware and to Texas. The company’s board argued that Delaware’s court system—where a judge struck down Musk’s pay scheme in January—has been unfair to Tesla. “Hot damn, I love you guys,” an ebullient Musk told shareholders from the stage of the meeting in Austin, after the pay package approval was announced. This vote was a referendum on Musk’s leadership at Tesla, as some shareholders argued the CEO has grown more visibly distracted with his other companies, which include SpaceX, the tunneling venture the Boring Company, the social media site X, and the artificial intelligence firm xAI. The electric car company has also lost more than half its value since its highest heights, when it was worth some $1.24 trillion in late 2021. Slower car sales, increased competition in the electric car market, and a pivot to robotics and autonomous vehicle technology have left some shareholders confused about the future of Tesla. In a letter published before the vote, the proxy advising firm Glass Lewis said it was concerned that the compensation package would give Musk too much power over Tesla by making him the company’s largest shareholder “by a healthy margin.” But proponents for the package—who prevailed in Thursday’s vote—said the compensation was fair payment for Musk’s performance at Tesla. “If Tesla is to retain Elon’s attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,” board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders ahead of the vote. Musk’s compensation package, tied to a series of ambitious financial targets, was first approved by more than 70 percent of Tesla shareholders in 2018. But a group of investors challenged the package in a Delaware court, and in January a state chancery judge threw it out, ruling it should be undone. The package, she wrote, was an “unfathomable sum” and had been approved by a board of directors made up of less-than-impartial members. Now, Musk will have even greater control over his electric car company. What he does with that power remains to be seen. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams"
6,"Kate Knibbs, Emily Mullin",Supreme Court Upholds Access to Abortion Pill in Unanimous Vote,https://www.wired.com/story/supreme-court-upholds-access-to-abortion-pill-mifepristone/,The biggest battle over abortion rights since Roe v. Wade is over for now—and the Supreme Court has averted a major crisis for reproductive healthcare.,2024-06-13T14:28:51Z,"By Kate Knibbs and Emily Mullin The Supreme Court just handed down its most important ruling on reproductive rights since its 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that protected the national right to have an abortion. The court today affirmed the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. In a 9–0 decision in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the justices found that the plaintiffs of a lawsuit that sought to pull the drug off the market lacked standing—that is, they did not have the right to bring the case to court. “The plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone. And FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything. Rather, the plaintiffs want FDA to make mifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe and for pregnant women to obtain,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh writes in the decision. “A plaintiff ’s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue. Nor do the plaintiffs’ other standing theories suffice. Therefore, the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA’s actions.” The Supreme Court’s decision puts an end to a tangle of legal disputes in the lower courts that has caused widespread confusion over the legal status of mifepristone. It means that the drug will remain legal to use in states that permit abortion and can continue to be distributed by mail. Medical experts and health care providers applauded the court’s decision. “Mifepristone is safe, effective, and a crucial part of expanding abortion access in this post-Roe world,” says Kiki Freedman, CEO and cofounder of abortion telehealth provider Hey Jane, adding that the company will continue to deliver evidence-based, compassionate medication abortion care. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000. It’s used in combination with a second pill, misoprostol, to induce an abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. It works by blocking a hormone called progesterone that’s needed for a pregnancy to continue, while misoprostol causes uterine contractions. In the United States, pills are now more common than abortion procedures, accounting for more than six out of 10 abortions in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Despite mifepristone’s established safety record, a group of antiabortion activists and doctors known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine filed a lawsuit in November 2022 seeking to invalidate the FDA’s approval of the drug, claiming it’s too dangerous to be on the market. In the suit, the alliance argued that mifepristone has led to increased emergency room visits, citing a 2021 study that was retracted earlier this year after an independent review found that its authors came to inaccurate conclusions. In April 2023, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas sided with the alliance and overturned the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, effectively instituting a nationwide ban on the drug’s use. The ruling caused shockwaves as it demonstrated that the courts could revoke a drug’s approval and override the expertise of the FDA. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams But things changed quickly. A week later, an appeals court ruled to keep mifepristone on the market, but rolled back changes that the FDA has made in recent years to make it easier to get the drug, including removing the in-person dispensing requirement. This put telemedicine access to the pill in jeopardy. The FDA and the pharmaceutical company Danco Laboratories (which sells the brand-name version of mifepristone, Mifeprex) sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, asking to preserve access until it heard the case. The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, keeping the pill available under the status quo, then later decided to take up the case. While FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine wound through the courts, many states like California and New York enshrined abortion rights by passing shield laws, which protect health care professionals who offer care to pregnant patients in states where abortion is banned. This helped some providers, like longtime medication-abortion advocacy group Aid Access, to mail abortion pills to people who requested them in states like Louisiana and Arkansas. Those in the pharmaceutical industry worried that if the Supreme Court nullified mifepristone’s approval, it could put virtually any other drug on the market at risk—especially those seen as controversial, such as birth control pills, drugs that prevent HIV infection, or even Covid-19 vaccines. But when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case in March, the justices questioned whether the plaintiffs were the right party to bring the case to the court. In order to have standing to sue, plaintiffs must prove that they are the aggrieved or injured party. Thursday’s decision makes it clear that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine was not harmed in any way because of the availability of mifepristone. Diane Horvath, a complex family planning specialist and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says the Supreme Court decision is a welcome one, allowing health care providers to continue dispensing abortion pills as they had before. “But it certainly leaves the door open for another case with new plaintiffs,” she says. Since the justices focused on whether the plaintiffs had standing and did not address their claims about mifepristone’s safety, she fears that the fight over the abortion pill is not done yet. “Despite this win at the court, the situation regarding access to these life-saving medications continues to deteriorate at the state level,” says Elisa Wells, cofounder of the abortion information campaign Plan C Pills. In Louisiana, which has a near-total abortion ban, state lawmakers recently passed the first bill of its kind to designate both mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances. And last month in Arkansas, the state’s attorney general ordered abortion pill providers to stop advertising there."
7,Matt Reynolds,The World’s Largest Fungarium May Unlock the Mysteries of Carbon Capture,https://www.wired.com/story/mushrooms-fungi-carbon-capture-kew/,"Research is uncovering the key role that fungi play in getting soils to absorb carbon, and how humanity’s actions aboveground are wreaking havoc in the mysterious fungal world below.",2024-06-07T11:00:00Z,"Matt Reynolds It’s hard to miss the headliners at Kew Gardens. The botanical collection in London is home to towering redwoods and giant Amazonian water lilies capable of holding up a small child. Each spring, its huge greenhouses pop with the Technicolor displays of multiple orchid species. But for the really good stuff at Kew, you have to look below the ground. Tucked underneath a laboratory at the garden’s eastern edge is the fungarium: the largest collection of fungi anywhere in the world. Nestled inside a series of green cardboard boxes are some 1.3 million specimens of fruiting bodies—the parts of the fungi that appear above ground and release spores. Lee Davies, fungarium collections manager at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in London. “This is basically a library of fungi,” says Lee Davies, curator of the Kew fungarium. “What this allows us to do is to come up with a reference of fungal biodiversity—what fungi are out there in the world, where you can find them.” Archivists—wearing mushroom hats for some reason—float between the shelves, busily digitizing the vast archive, which includes around half of all the species known to science. In the hierarchy of environmental causes, fungi have traditionally ranked somewhere close to the bottom, Davies says. He himself was brought to the fungarium against his will. Davies was working with tropical plants when a staffing reshuffle brought him to the temperature-controlled environs of the fungarium. “They moved me here in 2014, and it’s amazing. Best thing ever, I love it. It’s been a total conversion.” Drying specimens preserves them for long-term study. These mushrooms were freeze-dried. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Davies’ own epiphany echoes a wider awakening of appreciation for these overlooked organisms. In 2020, mycologist Merlin Sheldrake’s book Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds, and Shape Our Futures was a surprise bestseller. In the video game and HBO series The Last of Us, it’s a fictional brain-eating fungus from the genus Cordyceps that sends the world into an apocalyptic spiral. (The Kew collection includes a tarantula infected with Cordyceps—fungal tendrils reach out from the soft gaps between the dead arachnid’s limbs.) Emil Ghaffar, an MSc student, examining mycorrhizal fungi on plant roots under a microscope. While the wider world is waking up to these fascinating organisms, scientists are getting to grips with the crucial role they play in ecosystems. In a laboratory just above the Kew fungarium, mycologist Laura Martinez-Suz studies how fungi help sequester carbon in the soil, and why some places seem much better at storing soil carbon than others. Soil is a huge reservoir of carbon. There are around 1.5 trillion tons of organic carbon stored in soils across the world—about twice the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Scientists used to think that most of this carbon entered the soil when dead leaves and plant matter decomposed, but it’s now becoming clear that plant roots and fungi networks are a critical part of this process. One study of forested islands in Sweden found that the majority of carbon in the forest soil actually came from root-fungi networks, not plant matter fallen from above the ground. Ectomycorrhizal fungi on the roots of an oak tree, where it exists in a symbiotic relationship. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Martinez-Suz’s research focuses on mycorrhizal fungi—a large group of fungi that coexist with plant root systems. The mycorrhizal fungi form networks that can go around and sometimes inside plant roots, transferring nutrients and water to the plants in exchange for carbon. Around 90 percent of plant species are known to make these symbiotic trade networks with different species of fungi. “These plants are covered by these fungi. It’s incredible. They are small but they are everywhere,” says Martinez-Suz. This has serious implications for tree-planting schemes. Planting new forests is a major hope for carbon sequestration, but there is increasing evidence that the mycorrhizal networks might be crucial to the success of these attempts. One replanting study found that a forest of birch and pine trees planted onto heath moorland in northern Scotland did not increase soil carbon stocks even after nearly 40 years in the ground. The researchers who carried out the study think that it might be because the influx of new trees upset the delicate moorland mycorrhizal networks already present. “Replacing the complete set of fungi with other fungi has implications for long-term carbon sequestration in soil and biodiversity,” says Martinez-Suz. Her current project involves comparing samples from forests in low-pollution sites like northern Finland with those in heavily polluted regions like Belgium and the Netherlands. The fungi in polluted regions are less diverse, she says, and this might have a knock-on effect on how well those forests store carbon. The major culprit here is nitrogen pollution, which enters soils through burning fossil fuels for electricity and transport, and through agriculture. An excess of nitrogen changes the composition of soil fungi, so that the fungi that are the best at retaining nutrients and pumping carbon into the soil decrease. But there is some hope that forests can turn things around. One study in the Netherlands found that when nitrogen pollution reduced, beneficial fungi species started to return to the forests. The danger, Martinez-Suz says, is that if ecosystems are pushed too far then there might not be any fungal spores remaining to boost populations. If we’re to better understand how these fungi influence critical ecosystems, then we need to get to grips with all of these species. Mycologists think that nearly 90 percent of the world’s fungi species are still to be discovered, and the archivists at Kew are only halfway through the long process of digitizing their collection so that researchers can easily know where and when a species was found. Around 5,000 extra specimens enter the fungarium each year, and the shelves are crammed with samples waiting to be dehydrated and stored. Many of them, Davies says, are sent by amateur mycologists who are fascinated by the world of fungi. “People in academic institutions like this will send them stuff to work on and do identifications, because they are world experts even though they have no formal training. They’re just really obsessive. It’s so cool.” This article appears in the July/August 2024 issue of WIRED UK magazine.

Annoyed? Laughing? Let’s walk through this together. It’s a mess. On Monday, a fresh remix of “Wah Gwan Delilah” showed up on Snowd4y’s SoundCloud. It had what appeared to be Drake joining the comedian in a series of quips about women and name-checks of Toronto landmarks like the Yonge-Dundas Square mall. (“Wah gwan” is Jamaican patois for “What’s up?” and is common in the city, which has long had a sizable population of people of Caribbean descent.) As the track spread, it made its way to the Plain White T’s themselves, who posted a video on X and TikTok with the caption “too stunned to speak.” Front man Tom Higgenson also says, “It’s crazy that everybody thinks that it’s real,” seemingly referencing early rumors that Drake’s lyrics were generated using artificial intelligence. Higgenson also makes a series of faces that give off the appearance that he just smelled a fart. Those rumors, though, are likely untrue. Drake posted the song to his Instagram Story, seemingly confirming its authenticity. It’s easy to see, though, why everyone was confused. AI, as WIRED’s Evy Kwong pointed out Thursday on TikTok, has become so prevalent that it has caused people to question everything. When the song “Heart on My Sleeve” dropped, it took many people several listens to realize it wasn’t actually Drake and The Weeknd. Many fans probably never would’ve known the Beatles’ “Now and Then” wasn’t just a pristine long-lost tape if Paul McCartney hadn’t touted the AI needed to save it. Johnny Cash covers Taylor Swift from beyond the grave. Examples of AI’s ability to fool our ears feel truly endless. The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to TikTok. With the realness of Drake’s presence on “Wah Gwan Delilah” seemingly confirmed, the floodgates opened. Rap Twitter, as Billboard noted, had a field day “with the main perception being that after losing the battle to Kendrick, Drake is now just losing it in general” and “leaning into his Toronto-ness” for some image repair. Likely, this will have the opposite effect. While Drake Reddit is screaming that it’s satire and if people don’t get it, “the joke is probably on you,” other swaths of the internet remain unable to keep a straight face—or at least a non-cringing one. Vulture, in its writeup of the remix, simply said “post-beef Drake cannot be serious.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Lamar, on the other hand, is very serious. Seriously scheduling his “Ken & Friends” concert, announced on Wednesday, to be held on June 19—Juneteenth—in Inglewood, California. Does this mean Drake and Lamar’s beef is over, or at least that Drake wants to move on from it? Perhaps. As C. Brandon Ogbunu and Lupe Fiasco wrote for WIRED just a few weeks ago, technology has forever changed how these conflicts play out. Whereas it used to take MCs days or months to release a new dis track on a mixtape or album, they can now be online in minutes. If Drake wants to divert attention by getting on Snowd4y’s SoundCloud remix, so be it. Whether or not it’ll work is up to the internet. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The rise of Zau. Remember Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the game that Raised by Wolves star Abubakar Salim made to grieve his father? Salim has been receiving a lot of harassment about that from, he says, “people who see diversity as a threat.” He posted a video late last week addressing that harassment and lowering the price of his game so that more people could experience it. Games have power, he said, “because there’s room for all of us.” If you want to see more of Salim, he makes his debut in House of the Dragon on June 16. License to chill. Honestly, I don’t even know what to write about this one, but the story behind that video that went viral of the guy who called into court from his car while his license was allegedly suspended just gets weirder and weirder. Happy Pride. Here’s a TikTok of someone playing Chappell Roan on church bells."
9,Kate Knibbs,The Fight Against AI Comes to a Foundational Data Set,https://www.wired.com/story/the-fight-against-ai-comes-to-a-foundational-data-set/,Long-running nonprofit Common Crawl has been a boon to researchers for years. But now its role in AI training data has triggered backlash from publishers.,2024-06-13T15:21:11Z,"Kate Knibbs Danish media outlets have demanded that the nonprofit web archive Common Crawl remove copies of their articles from past data sets and stop crawling their websites immediately. This request was issued amid growing outrage over how artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI are using copyrighted materials. Common Crawl plans to comply with the request, first issued on Monday. Executive director Rich Skrenta says the organization is “not equipped” to fight media companies and publishers in court. The Danish Rights Alliance (DRA), an association representing copyright holders in Denmark, spearheaded the campaign. It made the request on behalf of four media outlets, including Berlingske Media and the daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten. The New York Times made a similar request of Common Crawl last year, prior to filing a lawsuit against OpenAI for using its work without permission. In its complaint, the New York Times highlighted how Common Crawl’s data was the most “highly weighted data set” in GPT-3. Thomas Heldrup, the DRA’s head of content protection and enforcement, says that this new effort was inspired by the Times. “Common Crawl is unique in the sense that we’re seeing so many big AI companies using their data,” Heldrup says. He sees its corpus as a threat to media companies attempting to negotiate with AI titans. Although Common Crawl has been essential to the development of many text-based generative AI tools, it was not designed with AI in mind. Founded in 2007, the San Francisco–based organization was best known prior to the AI boom for its value as a research tool. “Common Crawl is caught up in this conflict about copyright and generative AI,” says Stefan Baack, a data analyst at the Mozilla Foundation who recently published a report on Common Crawl’s role in AI training. “For many years it was a small niche project that almost nobody knew about.” Prior to 2023, Common Crawl did not receive a single request to redact data. Now, in addition to the requests from the New York Times and this group of Danish publishers, it’s also fielding an uptick of requests that have not been made public. In addition to this sharp rise in demands to redact data, Common Crawl’s web crawler, CCBot, is also increasingly thwarted from accumulating new data from publishers. According to the AI detection startup Originality AI, which often tracks the use of web crawlers, more than 44 percent of the top global news and media sites block CCBot. Apart from BuzzFeed, which began blocking it in 2018, most of the prominent outlets it analyzed—including Reuters, the Washington Post, and the CBC—spurned the crawler in only the last year. “They’re being blocked more and more,” Baack says. Common Crawl’s quick compliance with this kind of request is driven by the realities of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. Compliance does not equate to ideological agreement, though. Skrenta sees this push to remove archival materials from data repositories like Common Crawl as nothing short of an affront to the internet as we know it. “It’s an existential threat,” he says. “They’ll kill the open web.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams He’s not alone in his concerns. “I’m very troubled by efforts to erase web history and especially news,” says journalism professor Jeff Jarvis, a staunch Common Crawl defender. “It’s been cited in 10,000 academic papers. It’s an incredibly valuable resource.” Common Crawl collects recent examples of research conducted using its data sets; newer highlights include a report on internet censorship in Turkmenistan and research into fine-tuning online fraud detection. Common Crawl’s evolution from low-key tool beloved by data nerds and ignored by everyone else to a newly-controversial AI helpmate is part of a larger clash over copyright and the open web. A growing contingent of publishers as well as some artists, writers, and other creative types are fighting efforts to crawl and scrape the web—sometimes even if said efforts are noncommercial, like Common Crawl’s ongoing project. Any project that could potentially be used to feed AI’s appetite for data is under scrutiny. In addition to a slew of lawsuits alleging copyright infringement filed against the generative AI world’s major players, copyright activists are also pushing for legislation to put guardrails on data training, forcing AI companies to pay for what they use. Additional scrutiny on Common Crawl and other popular data sets like LAION-5B have revealed that, in hoovering data from all over the internet, these corpuses have inadvertently archived some of its darkest corners. (LAION 5-B was temporarily taken down in December 2023 after an investigation by Stanford researchers found that the data set included child sexual abuse materials.) The Danish Rights Alliance has a notably hard-charging approach to AI and copyright issues. Earlier this year, it led a campaign to file Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices—which alert companies to potentially infringing content hosted on their platforms—for book publishers whose work had been uploaded to OpenAI’s GPT Store without their permission. Last year, it spearheaded an effort to remove a popular generative AI training set known as Books3 from the internet. As a whole, the Danish media is remarkably organized in its fight against AI companies using media as training data without first licensing it; a collective of major newspapers and TV stations has recently threatened to sue OpenAI unless it provides compensation for the use of their work in its training data. If enough publishers and news outlets opt out of Common Crawl, it could have a significant impact on academic research in a range of disciplines. It could also have another unintended consequence, Baack argues. He thinks that putting an end to Common Crawl might primarily impact newcomers and smaller projects in addition to academics, entrenching today’s power players in their current dominant positions and calcifying the field. “If Common Crawl is damaged so much that it’s not useful anymore as a training data source, I think we’d basically be empowering OpenAI and other leading AI companies,” he says. “They have the resources to crawl the web themselves now.”"
10,Vittoria Elliott,There's an AI Candidate Running for Parliament in the UK,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-candidate-running-for-parliament-uk/,"If it wins, “AI Steve” will be represented by businessman Steve Endacott in Parliament. Endacott says he'll merely be a conduit, and the AI will make the policy decisions.",2024-06-11T14:19:04Z,"Vittoria Elliott As the United Kingdom heads toward its elections next month, the country is seeing its first instance of a new kind of politician: an AI candidate. AI Steve, an avatar of real-life Steven Endacott, a Brighton-based businessman, is running for Parliament as an Independent. Voters will be able to cast their ballots for AI Steve, as well as ask policy positions or raise issues of their own. AI Steve will then incorporate suggestions and requests into its platform. Endacott will be the in-person representative attending meetings and parliamentary sessions on behalf of AI Steve. He says that he sees AI Steve as a way to allow for a more direct form of democracy. “We are actually, I think, reinventing politics using AI as a technology base, as a copilot, not to replace politicians but to really connect them into their audience, their constituency,” says Endacott. Currently, AI Steve is mistakenly listed on the ballot as Steve AI, which Endacott is working to correct. AI Steve was designed by Neural Voice, an AI voice company of which Endacott is the chair. According to Jeremy Smith, the company’s cofounder, AI Steve can have up to 10,000 conversations at once. “A key element is creating your own database of information,” says Smith. “And how to inject customer data into it.” The idea for AI Steve came from Endacott’s own frustration with trying to enter politics in order to advocate for issues he cared about. “I’m very concerned about the environment. We need a lot of change in government to actually help control climate change,” he says. “The only way to do that is to stop talking to the outside and get inside the tent and start actually changing policy.” When Endacott attempted to stand for office in years past, he said he felt like it was all about party jockeying and worrying about which seats or districts were “safe” rather than responding to the needs of real people. AI Steve, he claims, will be different. AI Steve will transcribe and analyze conversations it has with voters and put issues of policy forward to “validators,” or regular people who can indicate whether they care about an issue or want to see a certain policy enacted. Endacott says that his team plans to reach out to commuters at the Brighton train stop, about an hour outside of London, asking them to fill out short policy surveys by email on their commutes to or from the city to help fill this role. “Having the voting system of validators to actually check those policies to make sure they’re common sense, and also in control of saying, ‘In Parliament, we want you to vote this way,’ just makes sense to me,” says Endacott. AI Steve has only been live for a day or so, but Endacott and Smith say that the primary concerns expressed by people contacting AI Steve have been about the conflict in Palestine and local issues such as trash collection. While Endacott says that he expects his own opinions or policy preferences may differ from those of AI Steve at some point, he says he is committed to voting in line with the constituent preferences as expressed through AI Steve. “Surely in a democracy, it's what your constituents want,” he says. “I know that it sounds so obvious, that a politician should be told what to do by his constituents. And if he doesn't like it, tough luck. Get out of the job.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams"
11,Amos Zeeberg,Light-Based Chips Could Help Slake AI's Ever-Growing Thirst for Energy,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-needs-enormous-computing-power-could-light-based-chips-help/,"Optical neural networks, which use photons instead of electrons, have advantages over traditional systems. They also face major obstacles.",2024-06-16T11:00:00Z,"Amos Zeeberg The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. Moore’s law is already pretty fast. It holds that computer chips pack in twice as many transistors every two years or so, producing major jumps in speed and efficiency. But the computing demands of the deep-learning era are growing even faster than that—at a pace that is likely not sustainable. The International Energy Agency predicts that artificial intelligence will consume 10 times as much power in 2026 as it did in 2023, and that data centers in that year will use as much energy as Japan. “The amount of [computing power] that AI needs doubles every three months,” said Nick Harris, founder and CEO of the computing-hardware company Lightmatter—far faster than Moore’s law predicts. “It’s going to break companies and economies.” One of the most promising ways forward involves processing information not with trusty electrons, which have dominated computing for over 50 years, but instead using the flow of photons, minuscule packets of light. Recent results suggest that, for certain computational tasks fundamental to modern artificial intelligence, light-based “optical computers” may offer an advantage. The development of optical computing is “paving the way for breakthroughs in fields that demand high-speed and high-efficiency processing, such as artificial intelligence,” said the University of Cambridge physicist Natalia Berloff. In theory, light provides tantalizing potential benefits. For one, optical signals can carry more information than electrical ones—they have more bandwidth. Optical frequencies are also much higher than electrical ones, so optical systems can run more computing steps in less time and with less latency. And then there’s the efficiency problem. In addition to the environmental and economic costs of relatively wasteful electronic chips, they also run so hot that only a tiny fraction of the transistors—the tiny switches at the heart of all computers—can be active at any moment. Optical computers could, in theory, run with more operations taking place simultaneously, churning through more data while using less energy. “If we could harness” these advantages, said Gordon Wetzstein, an electrical engineer at Stanford University, “this would open a lot of new possibilities.” Nick Harris founded a company whose chips use photons instead of electrons. By Jason Barlow By Geek's Guide to the Galaxy By Adrienne So By Eric Ravenscraft Seeing the potential advantages, researchers have long tried to use light for AI, a field with heavy computational needs. In the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, researchers used optical systems to build some of the earliest neural networks. Demetri Psaltis and two colleagues at the California Institute of Technology created a clever facial recognition system using one of these early optical neural networks (ONNs). They stored images of a subject—one of the researchers, in fact—as holograms in a photorefractive crystal. The researchers used the holograms to train an ONN, which could then recognize new images of the researcher and distinguish him from his colleagues. But light also has shortcomings. Crucially, photons generally don’t interact with each other, so it’s hard for one input signal to control another signal, which is the essence of what ordinary transistors do. Transistors also work exceptionally well. They’re now laid down on coin-size chips by the billion, the products of decades of incremental improvements. But in recent years, researchers have found a killer app for optical computing: matrix multiplication. The process of multiplying matrices, or arrays of numbers, undergirds a lot of heavy-duty computing. In neural networks, specifically, matrix multiplication is a fundamental step both in how networks are trained on old data and in how new data is processed in trained networks. And light just might be a better medium for matrix multiplication than electricity. This approach to AI computation exploded in 2017, when a group led by Dirk Englund and Marin Soljačić of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology described how to make an optical neural network built on a silicon chip. The researchers encoded the various quantities they wanted to multiply into beams of light, then sent the beams through a series of components that altered the beam’s phase—the way its light waves oscillated—with each phase alteration representing a multiplication step. By repeatedly splitting the beams, changing their phase, and recombining them, they could make the light effectively carry out matrix multiplication. At the end of the chip, the researchers placed photo detectors that measured the light beams and revealed the result. Lightmatter’s Passage chip, which the company expects to be ready in 2026, will combine electronic hardware with light-based interconnects. By Jason Barlow By Geek's Guide to the Galaxy By Adrienne So By Eric Ravenscraft The researchers taught their experimental device to recognize spoken vowels, a common benchmark task for neural networks. With the advantages of light, it could do so faster and more efficiently than an electronic device. Other researchers had known that light had the potential to be good for matrix multiplication; the 2017 paper showed how to put it into practice. The study “catalyzed massive, renewed interest in ONNs,” said Peter McMahon, a photonics expert at Cornell University. “That one has been super influential.” Since that 2017 paper, the field has seen steady improvement, as various researchers have come up with new kinds of optical computers. Englund and several collaborators recently unveiled a new optical network they call HITOP, which combines multiple advances. Most importantly, it aims to scale up the computation throughput with time, space, and wavelength. Zaijun Chen, a former MIT postdoc now based at the University of Southern California, said this helps HITOP overcome one of the drawbacks of optical neural networks: It takes significant energy to transfer data from electronic components into optical ones, and vice versa. But by packing the information into three dimensions of light, Chen said, it shoves more data through the ONN faster and spreads the energy cost over many calculations. This drives down the cost per calculation. The researchers reported that HITOP could run machine-learning models 25,000 times larger than previous chip-based ONNs. To be clear, the system is still far from matching its electronic predecessors; HITOP performs about 1 trillion operations per second, whereas sophisticated Nvidia chips can chug through 300 times as much data, said Chen, who hopes to scale up the technology to make it more competitive. But the optical chip’s efficiency is compelling. “The game here is that we lowered the energy cost 1,000 times,” Chen said. Other groups have created optical computers with different advantages. Last year, a team at the University of Pennsylvania described a new kind of ONN that offers unusual flexibility. This chip-based system shines a laser onto part of the semiconductor that makes up the electronic chip, which changes the semiconductor’s optical properties. The laser effectively maps the route for the optical signal to take—and hence the calculation it performs. This lets the researchers easily reconfigure what the system does. This is a stark difference from most other chip-based systems, optical and electric, where the route is laid down carefully in the fabrication plant and is very hard to change. Bhavin Shastri helped develop an optical neural network that overcomes interference between different wireless signals. By Jason Barlow By Geek's Guide to the Galaxy By Adrienne So By Eric Ravenscraft “What we have here is something incredibly simple,” said Tianwei Wu, the study’s lead author. “We can reprogram it, changing the laser patterns on the fly.” The researchers used the system to design a neural network that successfully discriminated vowel sounds. Most photonic systems need to be trained before they’re built, since training necessarily involves reconfiguring connections. But since this system is easily reconfigured, the researchers trained the model after it was installed on the semiconductor. They now plan to increase the size of the chip and encode more information in different colors of light, which should increase the amount of data it can handle. It’s progress that even Psaltis, who built the facial recognition system in the ’90s, finds impressive. “Our wildest dreams of 40 years ago were very modest compared to what has actually transpired.” While optical computing has advanced quickly over the past several years, it’s still far from displacing the electronic chips that run neural networks outside of labs. Papers announce photonic systems that work better than electronic ones, but they generally run small models using old network designs and small workloads. And many of the reported figures about photonic supremacy don’t tell the whole story, said Bhavin Shastri of Queen’s University in Ontario. “It’s very hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison with electronics,” he said. “For instance, when they use lasers, they don’t really talk about the energy to power the lasers.” Lab systems need to be scaled up before they can show competitive advantages. “How big do you have to make it to get a win?” McMahon asked. The answer: exceptionally big. That’s why no one can match a chip made by Nvidia, whose chips power many of the most advanced AI systems today. There is a huge list of engineering puzzles to figure out along the way—issues that the electronics side has solved over decades. “Electronics is starting with a big advantage,” said McMahon. Some researchers think ONN-based AI systems will first find success in specialized applications where they provide unique advantages. Shastri said one promising use is in counteracting interference between different wireless transmissions, such as 5G cellular towers and the radar altimeters that help planes navigate. Early this year, Shastri and several colleagues created an ONN that can sort out different transmissions and pick out a signal of interest in real time and with a processing delay of under 15 picoseconds (15 trillionths of a second)—less than one-thousandth of the time an electronic system would take, while using less than 1/70 of the power. But McMahon said the grand vision—an optical neural network that can surpass electronic systems for general use—remains worth pursuing. Last year his group ran simulations showing that, within a decade, a sufficiently large optical system could make some AI models more than 1,000 times as efficient as future electronic systems. “Lots of companies are now trying hard to get a 1.5-times benefit. A thousand-times benefit, that would be amazing,” he said. “This is maybe a 10-year project—if it succeeds.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences."
12,David Robson,The Science of Having a Great Conversation,https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-having-a-great-conversation-research-social-connection/,"Forming meaningful bonds with others can improve your health, make you mentally sharper, and fuel creativity. Making friends can feel daunting, but research shows there are many ways to build better connections.",2024-06-09T11:00:00Z,"David Robson If you’ve ever spoken to someone and later felt that you would have better spent your time talking to a brick wall, you’ll surely identify with the observations of Rebecca West. “There is no such thing as conversation,” the novelist and literary critic wrote in her collection of stories, The Harsh Voice. “It is an illusion. There are intersecting monologues, that is all.” If someone feels that their conversations have left no impression on those around them, then that is the definition of existential isolation. You’ve probably experienced this on a bad date, at an awful dinner party, or during an interminable family gathering. Psychological research has identified many habits and biases that impose barriers between ourselves and others—and if we wish to have greater connection with the people around us, we must learn how to overcome them. The good news is that corrections are very easy to put into practice. Tiny tweaks to our conversational style can bring enormous benefits. Buy this book at: If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Let’s begin with the sins of inattention. “The art of conversation is the art of hearing as well as of being heard,” declared the early 19th-century essayist William Hazlitt in his On the Conversation of Authors, published in 1820. “Some of the best talkers are, on this account, the worst company.” Hazlitt noted that many of his literary acquaintances—who included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Stendhal, and William Wordsworth—were so keen to show off their wit and intelligence that they lacked the basic civility of listening to others. He instead recommended that we imitate the painter James Northcote, who, he claimed, was the best listener and—as a result—the best converser that he knew. “I never ate or drank with Mr Northcote; but I have lived on his conversation with undiminished relish ever since I can remember,” Hazlitt wrote. Who wouldn’t want to leave their acquaintances feeling this way? The simplest way of achieving this is to ask more questions, yet surprisingly few people have cultivated this habit effectively. While studying for a PhD in organizational behavior at Harvard University, Karen Huang invited more than 130 participants into her laboratory and asked them to converse in pairs for a quarter of an hour through an online instant messenger. She found that, even in these 15 minutes, people’s rates of question-asking varied widely, from around four or fewer at the low end to nine or more at the high end. Asking more questions can make a big difference to someone’s likeability. In a separate experiment, Huang’s team analyzed recordings of people’s conversations during a speed-dating event. Some people consistently asked more questions than others, and this significantly predicted their chance of securing a second date. It’s easy to understand why questions are so charming: They demonstrate your wish to build mutual understanding and give you the chance to validate each other’s experiences. But even if we do pose lots of questions, we may not be asking the right kind. In her analyses, Huang considered six different categories of questions. You can see the examples below: 1. IntroductoryHello!Hey, how’s it going? 2. Follow-upI’m planning a trip to Canada.Oh, cool. Have you ever been there before? 3. Full switchI am working at a dry cleaner’s.What do you like doing for fun? 4. Partial switchI’m not super outdoorsy, but not opposed to a hike or something once in a while.Have you been to the beach much in Boston? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams 5. MirrorWhat did you have for breakfast?I had eggs and fruit. How about you? 6. RhetoricalYesterday I followed a marching band around.Where were they going? It’s a mystery. Huang found that follow-up questions, which ask for more information about a previous point, are much more appealing than the “switch” questions that change topic, or the “mirror” questions that simply copy what someone has already asked you. The most superficial are the introductory questions—essential social niceties, but which hardly demonstrate a genuine interest in another person. You might also avoid boomerasking—that’s the habit of posing a question as an excuse to talk about yourself. We could ask about someone’s profession, for example—not because we care how their job is going, but because we want to brag about our own promotion. Emerging research suggests that this habit is particularly unlikeable. The act of asking elaboration questions can become self-perpetuating. Once someone had made the effort to draw out their partner with one enquiry, it became much easier to ask another. People are acutely aware of whether they are being listened to attentively, and their perception of receiving active attention from another predicts their feelings of trust, and contributes to the well-being boost that typically comes from strong social connections. The more attentive we are to someone, the happier they feel. Unfortunately, many of us rely on the wrong cues to signal our interest in others. People can display their attention with nonverbal body language, such as leaning forward, nodding, or making empathetic facial expressions; they can employ “paralinguistic” cues such as murmuring sounds of assent or approval; or they may verbally acknowledge what the other person has said. While nonverbal and paralinguistic cues are often genuine signs of attention, they can also be feigned—and if we rely on these alone, our conversation partners may assume the worst. It is much safer to demonstrate your attention explicitly in the words that you say. Paraphrasing what the other person has said, for example, offers direct proof that you have processed their remark. This is another reason why follow-up questions are so powerful: The details that you include provide the necessary confirmation that you were intent on hearing what they had to say. Be careful to focus on the core point that the person has been trying to convey. If someone describes a bad date to you, for example, it’s no good inquiring about the bar or giving your opinions on the film that they watched. You can validate what they are thinking and feeling or perhaps, after acknowledging what they have said, offer an alternative interpretation that may open their mind to a new way of seeing the situation. You must show that you are at least trying to see things their way before offering your alternative take. As you converse, avoid being distracted by your surroundings. Each time that you show your mind is wandering, you weaken the connection that could have arisen from more attentive listening. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The practice of “phubbing”—or phone snubbing, constantly interrupting a conversation to check your smartphone—is similarly disruptive. In one observational study, researchers watched 100 pairs of participants conversing in local coffee shops. Some naturally took out their phones and held them in their hands or placed them on the table, while others left them out of sight. At the end of the conversation, the researchers asked each person to fill out a questionnaire exploring the experience, and they found that the mere presence of the phones on the table reduced the pair’s feelings of empathy for each other, resulting in a less fulfilling conversation. Given Hazlitt’s Law, we might conclude that we should always allow our acquaintance to take center stage. This advice can be found in many influential etiquette guides, but psychological research shows that it is misguided: We should feel free to take our fair share of the airtime. The creation of a shared reality between two people relies on us understanding each other. We should try to create conversations that allow both parties to open up about deeper thoughts and feelings to identify points of common ground. Arthur Aron has powerfully demonstrated the advantages of self-disclosure, using an experimental paradigm that is sometimes known as the “fast friends procedure.” Aron’s participants were first sorted into pairs. They were then given a series of 36 questions to discuss over the next 45 minutes. Half the pairs saw questions that stimulated small talk: This was the low self-disclosure condition. They were perfectly reasonable questions—the kind you might happily ask on a first date—but they weren’t necessarily going to provide many profound insights into someone’s inner life. The rest of the participants were asked to discuss more probing questions: This was the high self-disclosure condition. The aim was to get the pairs to open up to each other about their specific thoughts and feelings, with answers that more directly reflected the idiosyncrasies of their minds. In each case, the participants were asked to engage equally. “One of you should read aloud the first slip and then both do what it asks,” they were told. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams After the 45 minutes were up, the participants were asked to describe how close they felt to their partner using a seven-point scale, a higher score indicating greater closeness. The people in the high self-disclosure condition rated their relationship as 4, while those in the small talk condition rated themselves as 3. This would be a relatively large effect size for any single psychological intervention, but it’s especially noteworthy when you consider that most people’s lasting friendships do not score much higher. These results have now been replicated in large studies, which have also shown that it is just as effective during remote communication as face-to-face interactions. Self-disclosure can even increase connection among people from different social groups, increasing closeness regardless of differences in demographic factors, such as age or immigration status, that you may expect to pose as barriers to friendship. When asked to predict how they will feel during the exchange, most people expect that the fast friendship procedure will be painfully awkward. When they engage in the task, however, the conversation flows far more smoothly than they expected, and afterward they report feeling a greater sense of connection with their partners than they had thought possible. People expect their partners to be indifferent to them and to be bored by their self-disclosure. But people are far more interested in our innermost thoughts and feelings than we imagine. Self-disclosure requires a leap of faith, but when we make it, we tend to land safely. People who have undertaken heightened self-disclosure begin to show some of the physiological markers of social connection. When we form a shared reality with someone, our brains and bodies begin to synchronize as we both read and respond to the world in the same way. Our hormonal responses to stress become attuned, for example—so that levels of cortisol rise and fall in tandem as we experience the same events. The warm feelings of affection and trust that arise from self-disclosure seem to be aroused by the release of natural opioids in the brain, which encourages further bonding. To prove this, in 2019 a group of Canadian scientists turned to a drug called naltrexone that blocks the brain’s opioid signaling. Someone who is given morphine after taking naltrexone won’t feel the pain relief or sense of bliss that typically accompanies the drug. If opioids can explain some of the buzz we get from social connection, then participants who have taken naltrexone should not reap such large benefits from the fast friends procedure. The researchers recruited around 160 participants for their study, who were divided into pairs. Half were given naltrexone, and the others a placebo, before they each discussed the 36 self-disclosure questions. After their chat, each participant took a series of questionnaires describing how the conversation had evolved. As expected, the participants who had taken the naltrexone were less open in the conversations and this blunted the mood boost people normally experience following the exchange. Needless to say, using the 36 questions must be conducted with tact and discretion. While you might slip one or two into a conversation, you would look odd if you rolled them out whenever you met a new acquaintance—unless, of course, you explain what you are doing. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams More importantly, you should draw on the spirit of this research by being a little more transparent about your deeper thoughts and feelings. Whether you are describing a secret dream, expressing an unexpected emotional reaction to a news story, or talking about a particularly precious memory, be generous with the information that you provide. Eschewing small talk in favor of deeper conversations should boost your long-term life satisfaction. Researchers recently equipped 486 participants with a small “electronically activated recorder” that allowed the scientists to eavesdrop on the participants’ interactions. The scientists found that the amount of time someone spent in small talk about daily banalities made almost no difference to their contentment, whereas deeper conversations involving the exchange of meaningful information about their circumstances and interests had a significant impact. When you bare your soul, others will often respond in kind—and you will all feel better for it. We must look at one final psychological phenomenon, known as the “novelty penalty.” The term comes from an experiment by Gus Cooney, one of the researchers who discovered the liking gap—the disparity between how much someone thinks another person likes them, versus how much they actually do. His team first placed participants into groups of three. While alone, each member watched one of two short videos: a TED talk about the intelligence of crows or an interview with the owner of a specialist soda shop. The trio then met as a group, and one member—the speaker—was asked to describe the video he or she had seen, while the other two members listened for two minutes. In some groups, the listeners and speakers had all watched the same video, while in others, the speaker spoke about the clip that the listeners hadn’t seen. You would expect that learning something new would be far more enjoyable and interesting than hearing something that is already known to you. But the listeners had the opposite reaction: They tended to prefer hearing about the video they had just seen, remaining underwhelmed by the talk that contained fresh information. This is the novelty penalty: a general preference to hear about familiar experiences. You will have almost certainly noticed the novelty penalty when you have returned from an exotic holiday. Your mind is still full of all the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of the places and the amazing people that you met along the way. As you try to describe the experience, however, you may find people’s eyes glazing over. It’s not that your audience doesn’t care. They simply don’t have enough knowledge to immerse themselves in your descriptions and understand why the trip was so special to you. The informational gaps could create a feeling of distance that undermines the sense of a shared reality. One strategy to avoid this would be to focus on topics that are equally familiar to both parties. You may think that it’s cool to talk about music that no one else listens to, or films no one else has seen—but this can have the very opposite effect. Looking for shared interests or common experiences to discuss is much healthier. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams But avoiding all unfamiliar topics is far from the ideal way of building social connection; if a subject is central to your life and represents an important element of your personality, you need to find a way to express it—otherwise your shared reality with the other person will always have an important part missing. In these cases, you can escape the novelty penalty with vivid storytelling that helps to put the other person in your shoes. If you know that the person is a gastronome, for example, start out by discussing the food you ate on the trip, which should act as a bridge to their own interests and experiences. As you move onto less familiar terrain, you must make sure that you provide enough details to avoid creating unnecessary informational gaps. Think carefully about their baseline knowledge, so that you don’t patronize them—if necessary, you should ask how familiar the subject already is—and use this to gauge the elements that you need to include to ease their understanding. In Cooney’s experiments, speakers reduced the novelty penalty if they gave a more complete narrative of the videos under discussion. When they were recounting the recent scientific discoveries about crow intelligence, for example, it helped to describe the inspiration for the research, and a general overview of the main conclusions (crows are smart!), followed by more in-depth accounts of the individual findings. They ended by describing how we could train crows to pick up litter in sports stadiums—and how our understanding of crow intelligence might change the way we think about the human mind. With this level of detail, the speakers enjoyed the discussions almost as much as the discussion of the topic that was already familiar. You might also remember the novelty penalty when the roles are reversed, and you are struggling to engage with someone else’s experiences. In the past, your general reluctance to ask questions might have prevented you from seeking out the additional information that would allow you to close the gap in understanding. Whoever we are talking to, and whatever we are talking about, we should be looking for balance—in the exchanges between partners, in the depth of the discussion and in the familiarity of the topics. This is the crux of our fifth law of connection: In conversation, demonstrate active attention, engage in self-disclosure, and avoid the novelty penalty, to build mutual understanding and contribute to the merging of our minds. Whether we are on a first date or meeting a lifelong friend, each sentence we speak offers a new opportunity for greater connection.

13,Nena Farrell,Beis Makes the Viral Suitcase I Want to Take Everywhere,https://www.wired.com/story/beis-luggage-rave/,The Instagrammable luggage brand isn't just popular for its cute colors. Beis' Carry On also has a comfy handle and a built in weight gauge.,2024-06-07T14:30:00Z," Nena Farrell  Beis has been on my radar ever since it launched in 2018. I waited months to get my hands on the brand's Diaper Pack (9/10, WIRED Recommends) when my son was born, and I splurged on two different makeup bags from the company, in a fit of hospital bag packing nerves. My mom friend, meanwhile, rocks both the Ultimate Diaper Backpack ($188) and the included fanny pack. I consider copying her almost every day. But the brand is best known for its suitcase rather than the diaper bags I adore. Dubbed the Carry On ($199), Beis' hard-shell rolling suitcase is a popular choice among Instagrammers and the perpetually put-together people at the airport I aspire to be. Originally, I ignored the Carry On in favor of the rest of Beis’ vast lineup of bags (if someone, anyone, could please buy me the Backpack Tote I'm certain would improve my toddler-run life). It looked similar to an older Calpak suitcase that I already had; why upgrade? What could possibly be so much better than my existing suitcase? I used to fly on a near-monthly basis, and I didn't see a need to ditch my suitcase of choice now that I was flying less. But I had battered my old suitcase one time too many, and it was time to try something else as I prepared to fly across the country. After ordering Beis’ Carry On, I was shocked with how much I was missing. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Photograph: Beis On the outside, the Carry On looks pretty much like every other higher-end polycarbonate hard-shell rolling suitcase. It reminds me of the Away Carry On (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Calpak's previous hard-shell designs. The easiest way to tell it apart is its busier line pattern and its wide array of fun pastels and chic neutral shades. I chose the blue-toned Slate, replacing my baby-blue suitcase for something slightly more mature but equally easy to spot on a luggage turnstile. Inside, there are some nice additions. One side has a zippered enclosure and two more zippered pockets, which is pretty standard. But inside one of those pockets are two drawstring bags, the larger of which is labeled Dirt Bag, which could be for dirty clothes or for shoes you don't want touching other items. The smaller is simply labeled Not Beisic, giving you the freedom to use as you please—Beis recommends it for small valuables, but I could easily fit my favorite flat slides into this bag, or perhaps my house slippers if I wanted to feel really comfy wherever I was going. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The other side has a detachable compression flap that has pockets on both sides, which is handy if you want to keep a couple items nice and flat. I'm a clothing roller myself, so I just use it to divide and flatten everything in that half of the suitcase, but my husband has big plans to borrow this suitcase the next time he's packing a suit. It's got your classic X-strap to hold everything on that side down. While I have a couple of packing cubes and various bags that attempt to organize these things for me, the Beis’ built-in and included items bring me a lot of joy. The little organizer bags also come in the same color as the suitcase, which felt both fun and thoughtful. If you're a chronic overpacker like me and worried that all these options still won't rein your packing in, you'll be happy to hear that the Beis is expandable. A secondary zipper adds two more inches of space, which is great for emptying half your closet into this bag during a move or if you shop a little too hard while out of town. No matter how much I love the interior organization, the Carry On's best features are on the outside. There's little details that go the extra mile all over this suitcase. There's a little logo on the front that pops off, revealing a retracting strap. A retracting strap for what? A small bag! If your bag doesn't have a pass-through and weighs less than 15 pounds, you can loop the bag through this retractable strap and click it into place. Brilliant. Just don't hook anything too long on it or it'll drag on the ground–my 12-inch mini diaper backpack looked about as large as I could get away with without running into potential dragging. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano I also love that there's not just a lock on the side but also a weight gauge on the side handle that will turn red if your bag is over 50 pounds. When it’s less than 50 pounds, it stays clear. It looked like a little acrylic detail on the handle before I found out what it was. Did I initially think the lock was somehow the weight gauge? Yes. It's a subtle feature that's easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for but a very handy one you won't want to miss. Speaking of weight—hard-shell suitcases tend to be heavier than soft luggage, and the Beis weights just over 8.5 pounds. Our favorite hard-shell, the Away Carry On ($275), is a little lighter at 7.6 pounds. Personally, as a certified weak person, I didn't feel that the Beis was any heavier than I expected a hard-shell suitcase to be. It was plenty easy to maneuver when filled up and felt light when empty. The 360-degree wheels probably help with this, making the suitcase feel like it can glide across the floor in any direction no matter what you've stuffed into the various compartments. My final favorite thing is the cushy handle. There's a little pillow on the underside of the handle, so the whole thing isn't soft, but it hits my fingers nicely to make them feel extra comfortable as I walk around with the Beis. It sounds a little indulgent, but it made pulling the suitcase feel a little extra special. Why aren't all my bags this comfortable to hold, huh? Who do I call? Once I figure out who's in charge of these things, I'll be requesting all bags be as comfortable, organized, and nice to look at as Beis' Carry On. You're welcome."
14,Mark Harris,The Titan Submersible Disaster Shocked the World. The Exclusive Inside Story Is More Disturbing Than Anyone Imagined,https://www.wired.com/story/titan-submersible-disaster-inside-story-oceangate-files/,"A year after OceanGate’s sub imploded, thousands of exclusive leaked documents and interviews with ex-employees reveal how the company’s CEO cut corners, ignored warnings, and lied in his fatal quest to reach the Titanic.",2024-06-11T10:00:00Z,"Mark Harris The Ocean Sciences Building at the University of Washington in Seattle is a brightly modern, four-story structure, with large glass windows reflecting the bay across the street. On the afternoon of July 7, 2016, it was being slowly locked down. Red lights began flashing at the entrances as students and faculty filed out under overcast skies. Eventually, just a handful of people remained inside, preparing to unleash one of the most destructive forces in the natural world: the crushing weight of about 2½ miles of ocean water. In the building’s high-pressure testing facility, a black, pill-shaped capsule hung from a hoist on the ceiling. About 3 feet long, it was a scale model of a submersible called Cyclops 2, developed by a local startup called OceanGate. The company’s CEO, Stockton Rush, had cofounded the company in 2009 as a sort of submarine charter service, anticipating a growing need for commercial and research trips to the ocean floor. At first, Rush acquired older, steel-hulled subs for expeditions, but in 2013 OceanGate had begun designing what the company called “a revolutionary new manned submersible.” Among the sub’s innovations were its lightweight hull, which was built from carbon fiber and could accommodate more passengers than the spherical cabins traditionally used in deep-sea diving. By 2016, Rush’s dream was to take paying customers down to the most famous shipwreck of them all: the Titanic, 3,800 meters below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Engineers carefully lowered the Cyclops 2 model into the testing tank nose-first, like a bomb being loaded into a silo, and then screwed on the tank’s 3,600-pound lid. Then they began pumping in water, increasing the pressure to mimic a submersible’s dive. If you’re hanging out at sea level, the weight of the atmosphere above you exerts 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). The deeper you go, the stronger that pressure; at the Titanic’s depth, the pressure is about 6,500 psi. Soon, the pressure gauge on UW’s test tank read 1,000 psi, and it kept ticking up—2,000 psi, 5,000 psi. At about the 73-minute mark, as the pressure in the tank reached 6,500 psi, there was a sudden roar and the tank shuddered violently. “I felt it in my body,” an OceanGate employee wrote in an email later that night. “The building rocked, and my ears rang for a long time.” “Scared the shit out of everyone,” he added. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen The model had imploded thousands of meters short of the safety margin OceanGate had designed for. In the high-stakes, high-cost world of crewed submersibles, most engineering teams would have gone back to the drawing board, or at least ordered more models to test. Rush’s company didn’t do either of those things. Instead, within months, OceanGate began building a full-scale Cyclops 2 based on the imploded model. This submersible design, later renamed Titan, eventually made it down to the Titanic in 2021. It even returned to the site for expeditions the next two years. But nearly one year ago, on June 18, 2023, Titan dove to the infamous wreck and imploded, instantly killing all five people onboard, including Rush himself. The disaster captivated and horrified the world. Deep-sea experts criticized OceanGate’s choices, from Titan’s carbon-fiber construction to Rush’s public disdain for industry regulations, which he believed stifled innovation. Organizations that had worked with OceanGate, including the University of Washington as well as the Boeing Company, released statements denying that they contributed to Titan. A trove of tens of thousands of internal OceanGate emails, documents, and photographs provided exclusively to WIRED by anonymous sources sheds new light on Titan’s development, from its initial design and manufacture through its first deep-sea operations. The documents, validated by interviews with two third-party suppliers and several former OceanGate employees with intimate knowledge of Titan, reveal never-before-reported details about the design and testing of the submersible. They show that Boeing and the University of Washington were both involved in the early stages of OceanGate’s carbon-fiber sub project, although their work did not make it into the final Titan design. The trove also reveals a company culture in which employees who questioned their bosses’ high-speed approach and decisions were dismissed as overly cautious or even fired. (The former employees who spoke to WIRED have asked not to be named for fear of being sued by the families of those who died aboard the vessel.) Most of all, the documents show how Rush, blinkered by his own ambition to be the Elon Musk of the deep seas, repeatedly overstated OceanGate’s progress and, on at least one occasion, outright lied about significant problems with Titan’s hull, which has not been previously reported. A representative for OceanGate, which ceased all operations last summer, declined to comment on WIRED’s findings. OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush aboard the Cyclops 1 in 2015. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen I met Stockton Rush on June 24, 2015, while reporting on OceanGate for New Scientist magazine. A former flight engineer and tech investor, Rush was already styling himself a subaquatic Musk. “I wanted to be the first person on Mars until I realized there was nothing there,” Rush told me at a city center dock in Seattle. “But in the ocean, there are new life-forms, things people have never discovered.” Rush believed that Earth’s oceans, not outer space, were where humanity would find refuge from existential risks like climate change. “My goal is to move the needle,” he told me. Around us, employees were prepping OceanGate’s prototype submersible, the Cyclops 1, for its deepest dive to date. The sub was a cylindrical, steel-hulled design rated for dives up to 500 meters. OceanGate had acquired it a few years earlier and refurbished it, adding LEDs and a PlayStation controller for easy steering, and replacing an ugly exterior cabin with a sleek white plastic fairing to protect components outside the hull. Together with the large acrylic viewport, the effect was a sort of one-eyed robot shark. Up to five people could squeeze inside—which is what Rush and I were about to do, for a test dive in Seattle’s Elliott Bay. Ninety minutes later and 130 meters deeper, we were totally lost. First the thruster software had glitched, leaving us floating just above the seafloor. Now the sub’s compass was acting up. The shipwreck we aimed to explore, a rail ferry that had once carried Teddy Roosevelt, was nowhere to be seen. All I could spy outside the Cyclops’ forward dome was the occasional salmon dancing in the frigid water. As I began to feel the chill seeping through the sub’s steel hull, Rush asked me to open my iPhone’s compass app. He wanted to compare it to the one on his phone. The headings did not match, but he rebooted the thrusters and we set off in what he was pretty sure was the right direction. “You’re heading in exactly the wrong direction,” said a faint voice transmitted via an acoustic link from the support ship tracking us on the surface. We eventually located the sunken ship, its rotting bow emerging into the Cyclops’ headlight. It was an otherworldly experience, made more thrilling by the hint of danger. Back at the dock, Rush brushed off the problems we had encountered. This is exactly why OceanGate started with the Cyclops 1, he said, rather than anything capable of diving deeper. “I could have built a multimillion-dollar version and all of a sudden I’ve got to figure out really stupid stuff like the magnetic compass,” he told me. “The Cyclops 1 is getting us ready. When we do the Cyclops 2, then all these bugs will be out.” The Cyclops 2, which Rush renamed Titan in 2018, was already on the drawing board. And Rush believed he had the biggest bug—how to make a vessel that could safely dive 20 times deeper than America’s nuclear subs—worked out. He would use a modern wonder material: carbon fiber. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Carbon-fiber composites are some of the strongest materials available to engineers. They are formed of thin strands of atomic carbon within plastic resins, layer upon layer, then cured carefully at high temperatures. The resulting composites can be both stronger and lighter than titanium, and it was this combination that caught Rush’s attention. A carbon-fiber Titan could be roughly the same size and weight as the steel Cyclops and yet be able to dive up to 12 times deeper. It would be much cheaper for a support vessel to carry and deploy at sea than a metal sub, and would also be more buoyant, reducing the risk of getting stranded on the ocean floor. While carbon fiber has been used in everything from cars to rockets, no one had ever dived in a deep-water carbon-fiber submersible. Rush wanted to be the first. In 2013, OceanGate struck up a partnership with the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory to develop the new sub. The university has a long history of working with composites and designing its own underwater vehicles. It also already had a relationship with OceanGate, after using its subs for research; the physics lab helped write the software used by Cyclops 1. The university touted the arrangement in press releases at the time: “UW, Local Company Building Innovative Deep-Sea Manned Submarine,” read one headline from October 2013. The story was updated with a note in 2023 saying that “the vessel that resulted from this partnership” was the Cyclops 1. Emails from OceanGate leaked exclusively to WIRED indicate that UW researchers provided hundreds of detailed 3D CAD drawings of components for a carbon-fiber sub between 2013 and 2016, as part of a $5 million contract. But the relationship between the lab and OceanGate was contentious, according to emails. UW claims that OceanGate and the lab parted ways after just $650,000 worth of work, and former OceanGate employees told WIRED that none of UW’s hardware or software work wound up in the finished sub. OceanGate also announced that Boeing Research & Technology was helping with the project. In October 2013, two engineers at Boeing, Mark Negley and William Koch, produced a detailed 70-page preliminary design containing renderings, manufacturing advice, and technical analysis. These details of Boeing’s involvement have not been reported before. “Boeing was not a partner on the Titan and did not design or build it,” Jessica Kowal, a spokesperson for Boeing, said in a statement. The company declined to answer on the record any other questions from WIRED. Negley and Koch, who are still employed by Boeing, did not respond to LinkedIn messages. “The more innovative you get, the more testing you’ve got to do. It was pretty obvious that OceanGate wasn’t going to do the testing.” Even at this early stage, these engineers were warning of potential problems ahead. Negley and Koch pointed out that although composites can be stronger than any metal, they have other challenges. Carbon fiber can get progressively weaker, sometimes in unexpected ways. The manufacturing process can introduce defects if the resin is cured too long or not long enough, if debris gets in, or if the material is laid or wound unevenly. And the more layers a structure has, the engineers wrote, the greater the risk of a defect that would weaken it. Titan would ultimately have 660 layers of carbon fiber. To mitigate these risks, the Boeing engineers suggested a rigorous quality assurance process during manufacture and ultrasound testing of the hull after it was made. Ultrasound scans could find defects or delaminations in the hull—places where the carbon-fiber layers had separated. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen To manufacture the hull, Rush turned to a company called Spencer Composites. First, though, OceanGate needed a scaled-down model of the hull to test how it would fare against the intense pressures at the bottom of the sea. By 2015, according to a design document written by Spencer, OceanGate wanted its hull to be rated up to 6,000 meters and have a safety factor of up to 2.25—meaning that it should be stable to two and a quarter times that depth, or 13,500 meters. James Cameron’s record-setting Deepsea Challenger had a safety factor of 1.36. Alvin, the submersible that originally explored the Titanic, had a 1.8 or higher. (Spencer Composites did not respond to requests for comment.) In June 2015, just before my trip in Cyclops 1, engineers placed a one-third scale model of Titan in an 8-foot-long testing tank at APL-UW for its first pressure test. This model was built entirely of carbon fiber, including the end domes, which ended up failing at pressures equating to around just 3,000 meters, according to a report written by Rush. OceanGate commissioned Spencer to make more domes, but these would take months to arrive. Meanwhile, the cylinder was tested again, this time with solid aluminum discs on the ends, and reached 4,100 meters without incident. But when OceanGate received the new carbon-fiber domes and tested the hull in March 2016, the new domes again imploded at 3,000 meters. The test that “scared the shit out of everyone,” in one engineer’s words, was OceanGate’s fourth. This time, the hull (again with aluminum caps) reached the equivalent of 4,500 meters before imploding, giving it a miserly 1.18 safety factor for any dives to Titanic depths. Damage to the scale model after imploding in the testing tank. “Over the next months we will analyze the data in detail … and then run a test with a new cylinder through at least 1,000 cycles to confirm its durability,” Rush wrote to shareholders at the time. That replacement scale model was not made, and the new tests never happened, former employees tell WIRED, in part because Rush trusted OceanGate’s computer models. Even when OceanGate decided to change the domes in the final design from carbon fiber to titanium, Rush didn’t commission models to test the interactions between the new materials; one former employee who was familiar with Rush’s decision says the CEO balked at the high price tag. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen “The modeling says it’s OK. The analysis says it’s OK,” one former employee says. “We build airplanes on the same type of analysis and then we go throw people in them.” But a low-pressure environment, like flying, is different from a high-pressure one. Carbon fiber is inherently stronger when holding pressure in, like what happens with an aircraft in the stratosphere, than when keeping pressure out, as happens underwater. And all cylindrical vessels resist buckling better when the air pressure is higher inside. Submersible experts not associated with OceanGate told WIRED that they would do much more testing on a new design. “We did at least 10 scale-model pressure hulls that we tested to destruction,” says Adam Wright, an engineer who had worked on explorer Steve Fossett’s 2005 carbon-fiber sub, which was shelved after Fossett died in a plane crash. And that was for a submersible that would only be used for a single mission. OceanGate was planning to use its submersible repeatedly—up to 10,000 times, according to internal design documents. “Carbon fiber is a very sensible material if it’s been engineered correctly and manufactured in a controlled way,” says Chase Hogoboom, president and cofounder of Composite Energy Technologies, which has successfully tested small carbon-fiber vessels to the equivalent of 6,000 meters hundreds of times. “It takes millions of dollars and many years, but it’s not rocket science. It’s just connecting the dots.” OceanGate tested the model hull to destruction only once, and never used the titanium components that would become fixtures on the final sub. Instead, the company simply increased the thickness of the carbon-fiber hull in its design specs from 4.5 to 5 inches, and commissioned Spencer to build the real thing. (Later, OceanGate engineers found that Titan’s full-size hull was too thick for portable ultrasonic scanners, and a coating Spencer had applied to it would further block the signals. Rush decided that moving the entire sub to a lab for scanning would be too expensive, says a former employee who was familiar with Rush’s thinking. As a result, no scans were made—going against the advice of both Boeing and OceanGate engineers.) Key components of the Titan submersible By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Unlike Cyclops 1, with its large, 180-degree viewing dome, Titan’s front dome was made of solid titanium, with a smaller 23-inch viewport in the center. The viewport, made from 9-inch-thick acrylic, was an entirely new design by Tony Nissen, OceanGate’s director of engineering, and it was going to be manufactured by a company called Hydrospace Group. Will Kohnen, Hydrospace’s CEO, told WIRED that he had originally expected Rush to thoroughly test the viewport according to rigorous standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Under those standards, OceanGate would test at least five windows to destruction at high pressure, cycle a viewport from low to high pressure a thousand times, and subject another viewport to five times the intended pressure for 300 consecutive hours to see how much the plastic slowly shrank under pressure, says Kohnen. “The more innovative you get, the more testing you’ve got to do,” Kohnen says. “Over a period of years, it was pretty obvious that OceanGate wasn’t going to do the testing.” The former employees who spoke to WIRED also said that OceanGate wasn’t testing the viewport to the society’s standards. By the fall of 2017, Kohnen was getting worried. As a last-ditch effort, in November he sent Rush an email offering “a serious discount” to build a second viewport using a design that had been tested and certified to 4,000 meters. It could be swapped out for the experimental window within 24 hours, he wrote. Kohnen says that Rush told him he wasn’t interested. Kohnen delivered OceanGate’s viewport in December. He would rate it to only 650 meters—one-sixth of the depth to the Titanic. He also shared an analysis, done pro bono by an independent expert, concluding that OceanGate’s design might fail after only a few 4,000-meter dives. OceanGate nevertheless installed the viewport in Titan later that month. Construction on the sub was almost complete, and the company was already advertising its first expedition to the Titanic in May. It was time for the engineers to hand it over to OceanGate’s operations team for testing at sea. But there was another snag. David Lochridge, who oversaw marine operations at the company and who needed to sign off on the transfer, became convinced that Titan was unsafe. In January 2018, Lochridge sent Rush a quality-control inspection report detailing 27 issues with the vehicle, from questionable O-ring seals on the domes and missing bolts to flammable materials and more concerns about its carbon-fiber hull. Rush fired him the next day. (Although Lochridge later made a whistleblower report to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration about Titan, Rush sued him for breach of contract. The settlement of that lawsuit resulted in Lochridge dropping his complaint, paying OceanGate nearly $10,000, and signing an NDA. Lochridge did not respond to WIRED.) Will Kohnen also couldn’t forget about Titan, and the foreboding he had about the whole enterprise. “We have a rogue element within the submersible industry,” he remembers thinking. If something went wrong with Titan, it might scare people off deep-sea exploration more widely. In March 2018, he drafted a letter, signed by more than 30 crewed submersible experts, urging Rush to test the vessel with an accredited outside group. (The letter was earlier reported by the New York Times.) By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Virtually all marine vessels are certified by organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping, DNV, or Lloyd’s Register, which ensure that they are built using approved materials and methods and carry appropriate safety gear. It has been widely reported that Rush was dismissive of such certification, but what has not been made public until now is that OceanGate pursued certification with DNV (then known as DNV GL) in 2017—until Rush saw the price. “[DNV] informed me that this was not an easy few thousand dollar project as [it] had presented, but would cost around $50,000,” he later wrote in an email to Rob McCallum, a deep-sea explorer who had also signed Kohnen’s letter. “Titan and its safety systems are way beyond anything currently in use … I have grown tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation and new entrants from entering their small existing market,” Rush wrote to McCallum. “Since [starting] OceanGate we have heard the baseless cries of ‘you are going to kill someone’ way too often.” Days later, Rush received an even more pointed warning from Boeing’s Mark Negley, who had stayed in contact with the CEO after he helped with a preliminary design. Negley had recently carried out an analysis of Spencer Composites’ hull based on information Rush had shared. He did not mince words when sharing his findings, which WIRED is reporting for the first time. “We think you are at a high risk of a significant failure at or before you reach 4,000 meters. We do not think you have any safety margin,” he wrote in an email on March 30. “Be cautious and careful.” Negley provided a graph charting the strain on the submersible against depth. It shows a skull and crossbones in the region below 4,000 meters. The chart Mark Negley shared with Stockton Rush By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Despite repeated warnings, Rush seemed unfazed. His confidence in Titan was based in part on the new safety systems OceanGate had designed. “A lot of risk mitigation was supposed to ride on the real-time health monitoring,” says one former employee. The heart of that system, designed by an experienced electrical engineer and OceanGate board member named Mike Furlotti, was a suite of sensors and microchips that analyzed the hull’s acoustic emissions—the little pops made by carbon fibers as they break under compression. OceanGate’s theory was that the hull would be fairly noisy on its first few dives but would get quieter when taken to the same depths over and over, one former employee explains. If the acoustic monitoring system started getting really loud on a dive, that would be a clear indication to surface immediately. (Multiple attempts to contact Furlotti for comment were unsuccessful.) Wright and other industry experts have been extremely critical of this setup. “I’m sure you can pick up these acoustic events fine, but you just don’t know when the end point is,” he says. “You don’t know how many pops is too many, and it could be different for every vessel.” There was even skepticism within OceanGate itself. In September 2017, the engineer responsible for integrating Furlotti’s design into Titan sent an anxious email to management expressing concerns about the system’s ability to accurately track fiber breakage over time. OceanGate hired an outside consultant named Allen Green to assess the acoustic monitoring. Green, an authority on the sounds that materials make under stress, endorsed the system in 2018. Later, though, when Green saw how Rush was describing the system to the public—the CEO claimed it could detect the sound of “micro-buckling” in the sub’s hull “way before it fails”—he wrote a concerned email to an OceanGate employee, reported here for the first time. Rather than warning of failure, Green explained that the sounds indicated “irreversible” damage. “It is my belief, substantiated by many years of experience, that composite structures all have a finite lifetime,” wrote Green, who died in 2021. “While I do not intend to be an alarmist, I did not sleep well and arose early to send this message.” Rush had pitched OceanGate’s board and investors on a grand vision of what his company could be. By 2018, that included a fleet of self-driving Titans that could dive to 6,000 meters, and satellite offices in Croatia, Israel, and the South Pacific. He imagined a world whose oceans were populated by OceanGate’s crewed underwater bases, which could be used for data storage or even “Plan B habitats” for billionaire preppers. Reality was more prosaic. Like most startups, OceanGate was in constant need of funds. Rush was trying to save money wherever he could. Interns, who made up around a third of the engineering team, were paid as little as $13 an hour. (When a manager pointed out in 2016 that Washington’s minimum wage was just $9.47 an hour, Rush responded, “I agree we are high. $10 seems fair.”) Rush also downgraded the sub’s titanium components from aerospace grade 5 quality to weaker and cheaper grade 3, says one former employee. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen According to internal documents, by 2018 the company had raised around $9 million in venture capital and another $4 million from subsidiary companies that profited off OceanGate’s research and scientific missions. But the real business opportunity would be trips to the Titanic. Rush had planned six missions to visit the legendary shipwreck in the summer of 2018, each with nine people paying $105,000. With every mission bringing in nearly a million dollars in revenue but costing OceanGate only an estimated $333,000, the more visits Titan could make to the bottom of the North Atlantic, the better. Although the plan was for the finished sub to make more than 30 dives in shallow water before going to deeper waters, OceanGate managed just 18. In mid-April, Titan was transported to Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas, where deep water could be found very close to land. But before Titan was even moved into the water, it was hit by lightning, damaging its electronics. Some of the damaged equipment was replaced, but the sub was without many components for weeks. Rush nevertheless insisted on attempting a shallow dive during high, rolling seas. Choppy waves ripped fairings and foam from Titan as it was being towed back from the dive site, causing it to sink. “I was merely ‘spam in the can’ with no comms for 9+ hours inside the sub,” Rush wrote the next day. “I could see parts of the sub floating away on my cameras, but could not communicate to the tow team—a remarkably surreal and frustrating experience.” Rush had to face facts: There was now no chance of OceanGate reaching the Titanic in 2018. Eager ticket holders (and investors) would have to wait another year. While they were still in the Bahamas, the team did manage to lower Titan on a series of uncrewed dives, eventually reaching 4,000 meters. But engineers found the hull was warping more under compression than it was meant to, by perhaps as much as 37 percent. Nevertheless, Rush wanted to keep diving deeper with Titan, with himself at the helm. When one engineer expressed concern about performing crewed tests at this point, Nissen wrote to him, “Yesterday I told you if you don’t have the stomach for this type of engineering then OceanGate isn’t for you.” On December 10, Rush successfully dove Titan to a depth of 3,939 meters—just enough to get to the Titanic. Nissen wrote to the engineering team: “Diving to such deep depths is extremely complicated if you want to be untethered, communicate with the surface, be location tracked with reasonable accuracy, and monitor the health of your vehicle. And, we have delivered. You all have a lot to brag about.” Titan reached a similar depth again in April, with a crew of four including Rush. While OceanGate touted the dive as history-making proof of its submersible’s bona fides, even Rush was getting worried about loud noises the hull was making at depth. Then on June 7, three weeks before Titan’s maiden voyage to the Titanic, an OceanGate pilot inspecting the interior with a flashlight noticed a crack in the hull. He sent Rush an email warning that the crack was “pretty serious.” A detailed internal report later showed that at least 11 square feet of carbon fiber had delaminated—meaning the bonds between layers had separated. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen This time, Rush couldn’t ignore the data. The hull that was meant to last for 10,000 dives to the Titanic had made fewer than 50—and only three to 4,000 meters. It would have to be scrapped, and the Titanic missions would be delayed for yet another year. When Rush shared the news with GeekWire a few days later, however, he blamed the delay on legal complications with Titan’s support vessel. It’s true that OceanGate ran into issues with maritime law, says one former employee: “The lie is that it was not the reason we delayed.” After the crack was found in Titan’s hull, OceanGate started searching for a new carbon-fiber contractor. By early 2020, many OceanGate engineers had been laid off or had left the company, insiders say. Tony Nissen was out, and a team that had once numbered more than 20 was reduced to just a handful. “Stockton never really wanted an engineering team, but he needed somebody to build it,” says one insider. “We were down to a skeleton team,” says another. Rush then announced that the company had inked a partnership with NASA to “collaborate on the development, manufacturing, and testing” of a new carbon-fiber cylinder. (Covid-19 had other plans, shutting down NASA for months. Ultimately, the agency told ABC, “NASA did not conduct testing and manufacturing via its workforce or facilities.”) The new hull would instead be made by two aerospace firms in Washington state, Electroimpact and Janicki Industries. Electroimpact laid the carbon fibers, and Janicki cured the material in its ovens, confirmed one former employee. Electroimpact did not provide a response to questions about its role, and Janicki declined to comment. This time, OceanGate had two scale models made, which were once again tested at the University of Washington. Once again, the models imploded early, possibly due to warping of the hulls during manufacturing, says a former employee. OceanGate scrambled to solve the issue. One idea: Rather than cure all the layers at once, they would cure the hull in stages. Electroimpact would wind about 100 layers of the hull, then ship it to Janicki to cure and settle. Then Janicki would send the hull back to Electroimpact to repeat the process. They were running out of time, so they went for it—skipping tests of the new procedure on samples and going straight to manufacturing the second hull. “The first time we did multiple cures was when we did the full hull,” says one former employee. The new hull was finished by January 2021. It passed pressure testing, similar to what was done at the University of Washington, but at a facility in Maryland that could accommodate the full-size cylinder. OceanGate’s engineers now needed to integrate the new hull with the rest of Titan. But Titan’s two titanium domes were still attached to each end of the old hull, sitting on titanium rings glued to the carbon fiber with aerospace-grade epoxy adhesive. Commissioning new titanium interface rings and domes was ruled “an absolute no” by Rush, one former employee says, because of the extra cost and delay. The company that made the original titanium components told WIRED that it did not make new rings for Rush, and three former employees say that OceanGate did, in fact, salvage and reuse the originals. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen But staff had difficulty working out how to separate the old hull from the interface rings without damaging even a sliver of titanium. Gaps or bumps could have weakened the join with the new hull, say the sources. On dives, the hull and the rings needed to compress under pressure in perfect harmony. “I can’t imagine a situation where you could reuse the titanium rings,” Wright, the independent engineer, says. OceanGate somehow managed it. By February 2021, photos of the newly reconstructed Titan were popping up on OceanGate’s Facebook page and other social media. After the implosion in 2023, one ex-employee looked back at these and noticed an unexpected addition: The company had added metal lifting points to both interface rings, apparently to provide a new way to hoist Titan into and out of the water. The addition of the lifting rings, reported by WIRED for the first time, was confirmed by a former employee who saw the engineering drawings, and by another source. Previously, OceanGate had lifted Titan using a sling beneath the sub to avoid putting stress on the critical joins between the rings and the carbon-fiber hull. As far back as 2017, when the original Titan was first shipped to OceanGate, Nissen had warned the operations team to use only the sling: “The titanium cannot take load/tension.” “Lifting points are a very serious part of a pressure vessel design and must be considered carefully, tested, and qualified,” says Will Kohnen. “Any lifting arrangement may impose loads and stresses into the pressure vessel, and this must be mitigated by analysis and test.” It is unclear whether such analysis or tests were carried out. OceanGate originally used a sling system to lower its sub into the water, shown here. The diving season was about to begin, and after three years of expensive delays, OceanGate desperately needed income from the Titanic missions (whose tickets now cost $125,000 per person). “We were running out of time,” says a former OceanGate employee. Titan had only a few relatively shallow dives in Puget Sound before the company put it on a truck and sent it all the way across Canada to Newfoundland, the port closest to the Titanic wreck. By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen On July 13, 2021, OceanGate’s Titan made its first successful dive to the Titanic, with Rush serving as the pilot. “We had to overcome tremendous engineering, operational, business, and finally Covid-19 challenges to get here, and I am so proud of this team and grateful for the support of our many partners,” Rush said in a press release. After the 2021 expedition, OceanGate was flush with success. The company announced plans for the following year’s expedition to document the wreck “in more detail than ever before” and urging “aspiring mission specialists” to get in touch. The successes and warm media coverage continued in 2022. OceanGate was profiled by CBS Sunday Morning, which accompanied one of the missions that summer. When reporter David Pogue noticed how improvised the setup on the sub was, Rush reassured him. “The pressure vessel is not MacGyver at all, because that’s where we worked with Boeing and NASA and the University of Washington. Everything else can fail, your thrusters can go, your lights can go. You’re still going to be safe.” The rest of Pogue’s mission was sort of a farce—the sub got lost, things broke—but he came back safely. That’s not what happened the following year. In June 2023, five eager people got ready to dive back down to the Titanic. They were Rush; Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a deep-sea explorer; and three paying passengers: a businessman named Hamish Harding and a father-son duo, Shahzada and Suleman Dawood. On June 18, they sealed Titan and dove. Within two hours, the support ship had lost contact with them. Their disappearance set off a media frenzy. People speculated how long the crew might be able survive without power or aid. A massive search-and-rescue operation spent four days combing the sea before finding debris from the sub. The US Navy later confirmed it had detected loud sounds “consistent with an implosion” shortly after contact with Titan ended. OceanGate ceased its commercial and exploration activities a few weeks later. The US Coast Guard is currently leading an international investigation into the deaths. Several former employees said they were neither shocked nor surprised at OceanGate’s deadly accident. Three had left the company on safety grounds, and two separately described Titan as a ticking time bomb. One former employee remembers preparing Titan for multiple successful Titanic missions, prior to 2023. “I put my heart and soul into building that sub,” he says. “Many, many hours inside the sub, outside the sub, building and testing it. She was my baby.” Each time Titan was about to dip beneath the waves, he would pat her hull lightly. “I’d say, ‘Come on back to me baby, you’ll make it, you can do it.’ And when she’d come back up to the surface, I’d say, ‘Good job. You got everyone back up safe.’” Until one day, she didn’t. Now the bottom of the North Atlantic is littered with more evidence of human hubris, tiny pieces of a plastic video-game controller nestling among the barnacle-encrusted gold fixtures of the Titanic. Both vessels were at the cutting edge of technology, both exemplars of safety in the eyes of their overconfident creators. And in both cases, their passengers paid the price."

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED I am a menace. I walk around, nattering constantly to myself. More accurately, I natter constantly to my sunglasses. “Hey Meta, take a look. What kind of tree is that?” “Hey Meta, take a look. Does this concrete need resurfacing?” I’m listening to podcasts on my run through the built-in speakers. I’m using the camera embedded in the frame to take pictures of my parents’ yard so I can send critical texts to the gardener. I’m using the onboard microphone to query the internet, checking to see if the food cart is open. My Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarers and I have grown inseparable. I recently told my husband that I want to get a second pair with clear prescription lenses, so I can stop walking around the house at night wearing sunglasses. “Is that really what you want to do?” he asked, a bit nervously. Yes, it is what I want to do. Unlike clunky goggles or recent AI-powered hardware swings like the Humane Ai pin or the Rabbit R1, the Meta glasses are a stylish and useful addition to my technology quiver that integrate seamlessly into my real life. The future of wearable computing is here, and it looks just like Tom Cruise in Risky Business. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Photograph: Ray-Ban Let’s address the first, and most obvious, point with Meta's approach: Sunglasses serve an actual purpose. They protect my eyes, and they keep me from squinting outside. Also, they happen to make me look like a badass. I’ve worn the classic black Wayfarers for decades (I also have them in white, for when I’m feeling sassy), and the fact that I already like how I look in them is excellent motivation to get me to wear them. By partnering with Ray-Ban, Meta has capitalized on a preexisting fashion icon and taken a shortcut to familiarity. These look almost exactly the same as the regular glasses, and they're only a few grams heavier. The smart features aren't immediately obvious, so I can throw these on and bike to pick up my kids from school without looking like a Google Glasshole. The only time anyone has looked at me sideways for wearing them is when a friend greeted me while walking past my house, and I stood there like a lump because I was listening to the latest episode of Every Single Album while watering the garden. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Medea Giordano By Adrienne So Right now, they’re my favorite pair of workout headphones, because I only have to grab one accessory instead of two when I head out the door. My poor ears are the coat hooks of my head—now, instead of trying to thread my earbuds around my hat, hair, and sunglasses, I can just slip these on. As we noted in our review of the Meta smart glasses, the little speakers that sit over your ears have startlingly good audio quality. They get plenty loud enough to hear while running outside in a midsize city; the mandolin strums in the Band’s “Atlantic City” sound clear and shiny. It’s also incredibly convenient to be able to receive and make calls and listen to texts while I’m running without having to pull out my phone. I understand that a lot of people want to be able to zone out on a run, but I will stop whatever I’m doing if I get a call or text from my spouse, my kids, my kids’ school, or my parents. It’s not hard to imagine how much more fun this would be if I could make video calls while walking around. It’s not terribly likely for me personally, given that my family doesn’t use WhatsApp or Messenger, but it’s not out of the question. Unlike most of the smart glasses I've tested for WIRED, these are super easy to interact with. The controls are simple to remember and calibrated just right. Pressing the button to take a picture feels like second nature. Tapping the glasses to pause or restart audio or to adjust the volume always works. My hair or hat never accidentally start or stop a song. The camera is nice too, and I love being able to just quickly take a picture of whatever I’m looking at. When I'm not wearing the Metas, I miss them. I have outsourced about 80 percent of my brain to my phone's camera roll, and when I can't capture a special moment, I really feel like I'm missing out—like the time I raced to attend my daughter’s end-of-the-year school music performance and was the only parent not recording it. But wearing smart glasses with a camera built in soothes that anxiety. It's also so much faster and less obvious to record with the Metas than taking out a phone and holding it in the air. This ability to discretely record the world around me has also made my husband nervous. “Shouldn’t you ask them?” he says whenever someone accidentally walks in front of me while I’m surreptitiously taking a snap. (Should I?) But the real leap forward here is the inclusion of Meta's voice-activated AI assistant. It's silly but true: The thing that made AI finally feel useful to me was shrinking it down and installing it on my face. As we've watched the rise of AI gadgets and near-sentient chatbots, I have remained unclear on what, exactly, I’m supposed to be doing with them all. I like using ChatGPT for figuring out what to do with leftovers, but most of the time, I don’t have questions that a quick Google search on my phone can’t answer. That all changed when I started wearing the Metas. Once I slipped on a pair of voice-activated glasses, the world became full of questions, and I wanted answers. How much did that house across the street cost? The AI couldn’t tell me, but it did tell me that I needed to resurface the walkway in front of my house. I asked it to identify plants and cars, and it did a good job at both. (It might help that my neighborhood mostly has distinctive vehicles of the Subaru Forester and Dodge Challenger variety.) By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Medea Giordano By Adrienne So It also translated my son’s Spanish books mostly accurately—I speak and read Spanish—and it even felt free to editorialize. “We don’t know why Rafa is getting in the car, only that he will arrive by 3,” the Meta AI fretted, as an anxious aside while translating Que hacen Gabo y Rafa? for me. I've always been a big proponent of the metaverse; I've tried all the mixed-reality headsets and I love playing games in VR. But while these Meta Ray-Ban glasses don't project images or immerse you into virtual worlds the way those bigger headsets do, they bring a sensor-enabled, phone-free internet out into the real world. That makes them the simplest path into the metaverse that I've tried yet. They're not focused on gaming, so I don't have to convince anyone that they have value. All kinds of people like them. And they're affordable! Unlike the Apple Vision Pro, they don't cost thousands of dollars. There's no waitlist; you can pick up a pair of these at Sunglass Hut. Unlike all the giant strap-on VR goggles, they're comfortable, free of battery packs, and not at all awkward outside of the house. Unlike the Humane Ai Pin and the Rabbit R1, they actually work. And you don't have to remember to carry them around like a gadget; you're wearing sunglasses anyway. It already feels a little weird to switch from the Meta sunglasses to my prescription reading glasses when I start working, especially since work is when I have the most dumb questions that I need to answer immediately. (“Hey Meta, who is Trader Joe?”) If there was a product that could lure me out of Apple's walled garden and into the warm embrace of a company that has a documented history of not always doing the right thing with its customer's data, my talking sunglasses would be it."
16,Henri Robbins,HiGround Opal Base 65 Keyboard Review: More Hype Than Substance,https://www.wired.com/review/higround-opal-base-65-keyboard/,HiGround’s entry-level keyboard costs more and delivers less than most mid-tier mechanical keyboards.,2024-06-15T14:30:00Z,"Henri Robbins If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 5/10 My entire awareness of HiGround stems from content creators on social media promoting the company's keyboards—showing them off, touting how great they sound and feel to type on, and talking about the “premium unboxing experience.” HiGround, owned by eSports and lifestyle brand 100Thieves, has largely relied on viral marketing campaigns to get its name out. But the claims you see in these promotional videos are hard to quantify—what may seem good to someone who has only typed on a gaming keyboard may be disappointing to someone used to custom keyboards. The HiGround Opal Base 65 is a fairly traditional gaming keyboard. It serves its purpose, and I really can’t complain about that. It’s a bit of a brute-force solution though. HiGround has taken the simplest keyboard design and pushed it as far as possible without reworking its core principles. What the company got out of it is impressive, but putting more research and development into a refined system would have netted much better results. It feels like other heavily social-media-advertised products: It's acceptable on its own, but compared to other products in this price bracket it's clear the Base 65 is nowhere near as good a value proposition. Overall, the Opal Base 65 feels good to type on. Not great, but good. The switches—HiGround’s custom White Flame switches—are simple, smooth, linear switches with a medium-weight spring. They’re basic and inoffensive, and they can easily be swapped out for another switch thanks to the keyboard’s Gateron hot-swap sockets. These switches have box-style stems, which means they’re more resistant to dust and grime than most switches. This is nice to see on an entry-level keyboard, since it eliminates a potential point of failure, but I often find dustproof stems unnecessary unless you’re working in an environment with a lot of dirt and dust in the air (or if you regularly eat over your keyboard). Opening up the switches, they have a longer-than-usual spring installed. While these initially appear to be a two-stage spring with two separate weights, they feel more like a single-weight long spring, having a consistent keypress through the entire travel distance and an incredibly quick upstroke. As a result, typing feels faster, and keys return to their default position quickly, but the total keypress distance is also slightly shortened compared to your typical mechanical switch. (A shorter travel distance can be good or bad, depending on preference. I often find it makes gaming more responsive but typing less enjoyable when compared to a full-length switch.)

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED These switches have hardly any wobble left-to-right but have a slight amount of forward-and-back movement. This is likely due to the box-style construction, which limits the lateral movement of the stem. There appears to be factory-applied lube on the stem rails and on the spring, which helps to make typing smoother and eliminate any pinging and crunching sounds from the longer springs. The largest issue with this keyboard is the inconsistency of the longer keys: While some feel good to type on, others feel a bit spongy, resulting in an inconsistent typing feel. The switches are held in place by an aluminum plate that both stiffens the typing experience and enhances the RGB lighting effect thanks to its reflective silver finish. The plate, switches, and PCB are then screwed directly onto the bottom of the case to create a tray mount reminiscent of basic 60 percent keyboards like the Pok3r, the original Tofu60, or the Wooting 60HE. The mounting screws are screwed directly into the plastic case. Most plastic keyboards today have figured this out, pressing small metal fittings into any of the screw holes to keep the plastic from splitting, breaking down, or becoming stripped over time. Opting out of this, and instead choosing to screw directly into the plastic case, is something I’d expect to see on a keyboard at half the price. Tray-mounted keyboards have been around for a while but have slowly been phased out in exchange for mounting methods that present a more consistent typing feel. The main downside of a tray-mounted keyboard is that it makes the typing experience inconsistent: Keys closer to the screws feel a lot stiffer than keys far from the screws, and this typically affects the sound. Newer mounting methods, such as top-mounting or gasket-mounting, will suspend the main keyboard assembly around the outer edges, eliminating the dead zones where some areas are directly connected to the case.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED However, I did find a simple solution—removing the screws entirely. The silicone in the case is fitted incredibly well to the case, which means removing the six screws doesn’t make the inner assembly sit loosely or rattle around. Instead, it’s held in place through friction, similar to the Gummy O-Ring mount that a keyboard like the Bakeneko or Unikorn uses. Typing on it without the screws feels and sounds slightly better than the stock layout, since it prevents typing sounds from resonating through the case as much. However, the posts for the screws still result in some stiffness when typing. For the most part, the Basecamp 65 is a bog-standard 65 percent keyboard (it doesn't have all the keys you'd find in a traditional full-size keyboard, saving space on your desk). I don’t have any issue with this; it’s a solid layout that serves a need for people who don't use all those extra keys. It's a small detail, but having a Tilde (~) key on the default layout is nice. Most gaming keyboards without a Function row require you to press Fn + Esc to access it, but HiGround mapped it to the top-right key instead, making it much more convenient for accessing console commands in-game. However, such a standard layout means that I have all the issues with this keyboard that I do with any 65 percent board—for me, the layout is a bit too small for office or creative work and instead relegates the user almost entirely to gaming applications unless they have a mastery of function layers and reprogramming—something that’s made rather difficult by HiGround’s clunky proprietary software. While it does work for most things, HiGround's software feels unrefined. The interface and design are dated, the programmability relies on clunky and inconvenient drop-down and pop-up menus, and none of the menus match the specific keyboard being used (or, as far as I could tell, any of the keyboards HiGround offers). HiGround Opal Base 65 Keyboard Rating: 5/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED What impressed me, though, is the Base 65’s RGB lighting—between the clear case, white silicone dampening, transparent switches and keycaps, and the reflective aluminum plate, the RGB absolutely shines, making this keyboard a bright centerpiece on any desk. Sadly, programming the RGB is a bit of a chore, and most of the factory presets have incredibly limited customization. The saving grace is HiGround's pop culture collaborations. You can get a keyboard made in collaboration with Minecraft, and previously there have been tie-ins with game and anime series, including Naruto, Pokémon, Attack on Titan, Gundam, and Yu-Gi-Oh. However, this usually comes with a tradeoff: Would you rather have a high-quality keyboard or one designed after your favorite media franchise? This keyboard is flashy, colorful, and a statement piece. But besides visuals, the Base 65 keyboard doesn’t do anything new, or anything that justifies the price. I also want to note the “all sales are final” line in most of the company's product descriptions. Combine this with massive brand tie-ins and an emphasis on “limited” drops, and I’m reminded of the collab-based hypebeast sneaker culture of the 2010s; a marketing strategy that emphasizes exclusivity and makes people jump at “rare” (i.e., artificially scarce) products and assume they’re more valuable/higher-quality than they are. I know this is a lot of advertising rhetoric that sits outside the quality of the end product, but I think it’s important to consider why the keyboards are the way they are, and why they sell well despite some of the issues they may have. (As a side note, multiple keyboard collaborations from HiGround are currently being scalped on StockX.) I also found some frustration when trying to review this keyboard because, when HiGround had a release coming up, every single page on its website would redirect to a password-protected countdown. This meant that the keyboard’s documentation, drivers, and even basic product information were unavailable for the entire time while waiting on a limited release (in this case, the Minecraft keyboard collection). Ultimately, it's hard for me to recommend HiGround’s keyboards unless you really want a branded keyboard for a certain media franchise and are OK with the sacrifices to the build quality and typing experience.

17,Christopher Solomon,"Silicon Valley’s Fanciest Stolen Bikes Are Getting Trafficked by One Mastermind in Jalisco, Mexico",https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valleys-fanciest-stolen-bikes-trafficked-mastermind-jalisco-mexico/,"""We have people stealing all over the world."" A digital sleuth named Bryan Hance has spent the past four years obsessively uncovering a bicycle-theft pipeline of astonishing scale, running from the US West Coast to Mexico.",2024-06-12T10:00:00Z,"Christopher Solomon Bryan Hance was sitting in his basement one Sunday afternoon in June 2020 when he got an email about a secondhand bike for sale. A BMC Roadmachine 02 from a Swiss company, the bike was painted the color of a traffic cone, with goblin-green racing stripes. It was gorgeous. The bicycle boasted some of the fanciest components anyone could buy, like sleek Zipp wheels and electronic shifting. It was the kind of ride that made other cyclists envy it and its owner as they blew past on a straightaway. Hance guessed that a bike like that probably cost $8,000. Yet it was being offered for a fraction of that amount. Hance wasn’t in the market for a new bicycle, though. What intrigued him about the bike was something else: It was stolen. Hance is the cofounder of Bike Index, a site where people can register their bicycles (for free) and record when one has been stolen. This allows cyclists, and law enforcement, to keep their eyes peeled for a swiped bike. Since it was started in 2013, Bike Index has helped recover more than 14,000 stolen bikes, from Sacramento to Saskatchewan and as far away as Australia. Hance’s passion is bicycles, or to be more precise, the sense of community and general goodwill that a life in the saddle fosters. Every message that offers tips on a missing bike is cc’ed to him. Bryan Hance, the cofounder of Bike Index. Two weeks earlier, the owner of that Roadmachine had reported it stolen from the secure bike room of an apartment building in Mountain View, California. This latest email about the bike was from an anonymous source. The tipster pointed Hance to a Facebook page where there were more stolen bikes for sale—like a sweet 2018 Pivot Mach 4 mountain bike that sells new for about $7,000 and had been pinched from a San Jose garage two months previous; and a Specialized Stumpjumper Comp Carbon in space blue that had vanished nearly three weeks prior from Santa Clara, about 45 miles south of San Francisco. All of the bikes were late-model and pricey. All had disappeared recently from around Silicon Valley, where cycling was fashionable among tech workers. All were for sale at about one-third of their original prices. Hance thought he’d seen everything in his years bird-dogging stolen bikes. But this put him on his heels. Not so long ago, bike theft was a crime of opportunity—a snatch-and-grab, or someone applying a screwdriver to a flimsy lock. Those quaint days are over. Thieves now are more talented and brazen and prolific. They wield portable angle grinders and high-powered cordless screwdrivers. They scope neighborhoods in trucks equipped with ladders, to pluck fine bikes from second-story balconies. They’ll use your Strava feed to shadow you and your nice bike back to your home. A product designer who lives in an affluent neighborhood of Silicon Valley told me how, when he left his garage door open a crack for just an hour one morning in early 2020, thieves stole his $8,000 customized enduro mountain bike. He and his wife bought an alarm system. One night not long after, when the couple had latched the garage but forgotten to turn on the alarm, thieves broke open the door and stole his replacement bike, and this time grabbed his wife’s too—$26,000 in bikes lost in three months. Her bike was now for sale on that Facebook page. These were crazy times. The pandemic had been great for bike theft, because it had been great for bicycling. With so many Americans stranded at home, terrified of public transit, retail bike sales grew 65 percent in 2020, according to the NPD Group, which tracks such things. Sales of ebikes—bikes with electric motors—jumped 145 percent, the marketing consulting group found. Thieves sniffed opportunity. In the first six months of the pandemic, bike theft jumped by nearly one-third in New York City. Robbers in New York stripped the pandemic’s ubiquitous food-delivery drivers of their ebikes, which were crucial to their livelihood. In Portland, Oregon, where Hance lives, thefts rose 20 percent, to what some police called an all-time high. This atop a surge in bike crime that was happening even before the coronavirus struck. But one detail flummoxed Hance. The tip had come from Mexico. The tipster had found the bikes for sale there, on the Facebook page of a company called Constru-Bikes, though the spelling sometimes varied slightly, which appeared to be based in the state of Jalisco. Hance had heard rumors of transnational bike crime for a long time, but they were only that: rumors. Bike Index scarcely even had a presence in Mexico. What was this company, Constru-Bikes, that was selling the bikes? Hance wondered. And how in hell were bikes that were stolen in the Bay Area traveling almost 2,000 miles, to be sold south of the border? What Hance didn’t realize was that the crime he’d begun to uncover was massive—perhaps one of the largest of its kind anybody had ever seen. Nor did he realize that he’d ultimately become so obsessed with the case that, by the end, the only thing he’d want as much as justice was to be free of it. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen In late January 2021, I sat across a dining room table from Hance in an Airbnb in Portland. As he gulped the day’s first coffee, Hance opened his laptop and showed me his morning routine. First, he counted the stolen bike reports that had arrived in Bike Index’s inbox since 11 pm the previous night. Fifteen messages waited for him. “Slow day,” he said. The emails had arrived from London, Australia, New Orleans, the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. “Stealing from UW Medicine during a pandemic. Way to go, you piece of shit,” he muttered to the thief, wherever they were. Working quickly, Hance approved each report so that the bike would appear on Bike Index’s searchable database of stolen bikes. At that time, once a bike was listed as stolen, Bike Index also tweeted it out. As we talked, Hance pulled up security camera footage from a 2019 Portland break-in. He wanted to show me what bike owners were up against. We watched as three thieves gained access to a secure bike room in an apartment building and stole five bikes worth $10,000 in fewer than four minutes. Once inside, the thieves didn’t bother with the bike locks; they simply removed the cheap bike racks directly from the walls. Hance is 48, tall, genial, and floridly profane. By day he is a senior systems engineer protecting computer systems on some of the world’s flashiest mega-yachts. “And by night,” he told me, “I do stuff that actually affects my community,” by which he means Bike Index. When Hance is exasperated, which is often—with the sluggishness of police response to bike crime, say, or with the sundry iniquities of humanity—he lifts both hands and runs them through his hair, which falls away from his face in dark wings that call to mind a mid-’80s yearbook photo. Hance possesses a hypertrophied sense of right and wrong and an empathy meter that is tuned a bit higher than in most people. He’s the kind of guy you read about in the local news who donates a kidney to a distant college friend—which he did, in 2018. Bike Index is his manifest belief that technology, and sharing information, can help rebalance the scales between order and chaos. For all his work with bikes, Hance considers himself only a casual cyclist, splitting rides between an old Surly Pacer commuter bike, a Faraday ebike, and a Diverge gravel/road bike. “I just want to get from A to B. And I want to do it on a bike … I don’t want the planet to burn,” he told me. Still, he’s probably on two wheels more than many cyclists who bray about it. One morning we hopped on bikes so Hance could show me Portland’s extensive web of paths and bike lanes. We rode downtown and then around Inner Southeast Portland and along the Willamette River’s esplanade. He pedaled with the full, liquid strokes of a man who for one five-year stretch didn’t own a car. I had trouble keeping up. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Hance grew up in the little college town of Westerville, Ohio. One of his first memories is of his mother strapping him into a child’s seat on her bike and riding to a nearby produce stand. Eventually he graduated to a Huffy with a banana seat, then his father’s 10-speed. As kids, he and his brother rode their bikes everywhere. “It was your first little taste of freedom,” he said. As a student at the University of Arizona, Hance studied journalism and computer science. It was the mid-’90s and not long until the liftoff of the first dotcom boom. Databases fascinated him. He helped put the student newspaper online. He helped stream the radio station. Bryan Hance One morning in 1996, when he was a few semesters into college, Hance stood in his Tucson living room in a bath towel, dripping. Something’s wrong, he thought. Minutes before, his mountain bike had stood right there. Someone had entered and grabbed it while he showered. Hance had really gotten into mountain biking. He’d recently splurged on a blue Cannondale M300. Now it was gone. “A fucking knife in the heart,” he recalled. The theft was nearly three decades ago. When he recalls the incident, he’s still clearly furious. Tucson authorities were useless, Hance told me. On one side of the street, stolen bikes were handled by campus police; on the other side, he filed a report with the city police. And the two sides didn’t share information. This is insane, he thought. If no stolen-bikes database exists, I’ll build one. The initial 2005 website was amateurish. But it worked. Then he got busy with life and never improved it. Years later, a bike mechanic outside Chicago named Seth Herr set up a Kickstarter to get people to register their bikes when they bought them, in hopes that it would help if a bike was later stolen. In 2013 Hance and Herr merged their efforts and called it Bike Index. Today, along with the free registry, the site also sells registration systems and other tools to cities, universities, and the like. The database now contains more than 1.2 million bikes. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen At the dining room table on the morning of my visit, Hance’s fingers spidered across his keyboard. He logs new stolen-bike reports before work in the morning, and at lunch, and again before bed. As he typed, reports of two more stolen bikes landed in his inbox. Both were from California. This didn’t surprise him. “San Francisco,” he said, “is fucking ridiculous right now.” In the weeks after that tip from Mexico, Hance circulated the curious case of the stolen bikes in Mexico to colleagues, savvy Bay Area bike shop owners, cops. He also reached out to some trusted bike vigilantes who hunt stolens. In recent years a passionate subculture has emerged to fight back against bike crime, using a mix of old-school legwork and open source intelligence, following the publicly available fingerprints that nearly everyone leaves behind online. These amateur detectives often swap information and methods, sometimes with the ultimate aim of recovering the stolen bikes. Call them a crowdsourced Justice League. Bike Index and Hance are major planets in this loose constellation of do-gooders. Hance regularly calls on them. Almost as soon as Hance saw that Facebook page with all the stolen bikes, it vanished. Before long, though, a volunteer—the guy who’d lost $26,000 in bikes and now wanted to help Hance—called to say he’d found an Instagram account for Constru-Bikes. The account had accepted his request as a follower, thinking he was a customer. “Do you want my password?” the guy asked Hance. Armed with the volunteer’s login credentials and a beer, Hance lay down in his backyard hammock and opened the Instagram page. Holy shit. The Insta page had so many more bikes for sale than the Facebook page did. There were mountain bikes, road bikes, ebikes. There were brands that Hance had never even heard of, though he swam in a world of bikes every day. Fezzari (now called Ari). Breakbrake17. Devinci. Argon 18. All of them handsome, almost all of them $3,000 or $6,000 or even $10,000 when new. “It was the Amazon of stolen bikes,” he recounted to me. Every ad came with a slew of close-up photos and details. Hance took screenshots of everything. The shots would help him match the bikes he saw with owners who’d lost them. The pictures were also evidence, and he wanted to preserve them in case they vanished. As Hance worked he realized that many bicycles looked familiar. Here, you need to understand something: For people who really know and love bicycles, as Hance does, a mountain bike is never just a mountain bike. It’s a 2016 matte-black Niner Jet 9 RDO. Dual suspension. Carbon frame. 700C Maxxis tires. Shimano XT disc brakes. To a bike geek, such details are like whorls in a thumbprint, marking every bike as unique. Hance possesses nearly a savant’s ability to recall the bicycles he has seen, and details as small as a scratch on a down tube. He lay in the hammock until dinnertime that day, taking screenshots and saving photos and making mental notes to circle back to certain bikes. Soon, he and his fellow hunters began to match ads of bikes for sale on Constru-Bikes’ Insta page with ones stolen from the Bay Area. At times, it was comically easy, thanks to the many, detailed photos. One picture showed a white Gorilla mountain bike, a rare brand from Uganda, with the owner’s name clearly printed on the rear triangle of the bike’s frame. The owner told Hance it was the only bike of its kind in the US and that someone had stolen it in Oakland that same spring. In another ad, for a Bulls Grinder Evo ebike, the serial number was plainly visible in a photo; it was the same as one posted on Bike Index in July 2020. Its owner, a San Francisco tech worker named Ash Ramirez, had paid more than $5,200 for it and had used the bike as his primary means of transportation around the city—where he played on as many as five softball teams. “I went EVERYWHERE on my bike,” Ramirez later wrote me, describing how he loved pedaling through heavy traffic, past the miserable faces of drivers, before the bike was stolen from his Tenderloin apartment building. Hance enlisted the aid of a San Jose stolen-bikes Facebook group, who helped him confirm still more stolen bikes for sale. The number climbed into the dozens. Hance took each one personally, not just because he was wired that way but because he knew directly—from communication with hundreds of bereft cyclists over the years—that behind each lost bike was a phantom-limb ache. For many cyclists, a bike isn’t just an ingenious concatenation of gears and carefully chosen components. It’s the sum of everything the owner has experienced while in the saddle. A triathlon bike isn’t just a tri bike, he told me, but the bike an ex-soldier pedaled for eight hours every day when he returned from Afghanistan, trying to shake his PTSD. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Take Jorge Parrales and his relationship with his fixie: Parrales came to the US from Nicaragua in 2005, when he was 18. In time he grew addicted to the freedom of pedaling around San Francisco. Around 2016, Parrales spent more than he should have—$2,500—on a handsome, custom, fixed-gear bike. Every afternoon he rode it to his job as a bartender. At night when his shift ended, he would put in his earbuds, turn up the music, and climb on. The city belonged to him after midnight, the streets open and fast and treacherous with the fixie’s lack of standard brakes, and his body hummed with the thrill of it. The bike was transportation, but it also was freedom, and a sense of command. “All I can say is I was kind of in love with riding my bike in the city,” he told me. One night the bike vanished from outside Parrales’ apartment. Last year it appeared on Constru-Bikes. “I don’t know how to explain it to you,” Parrales said. “It is like half of my heart.” People tell Hance stories like this all the time. “They’re just vehicles for good,” he told me as we rode around Portland. He laughed at himself. “That sounds like a manifesto,” he said, “but I think life is better on a bike.” This is why he hates bike thieves so much. Thieves wreck all of this. Before the Facebook page for Constru-Bikes disappeared, Hance had written down an email address listed on it as a contact. He plugged the address into Google. This took him to different web pages, some of which had bikes for sale, too, and contained more breadcrumbs of information. On one page he found a phone number. He plugged the number into Google. This took him to still other websites. The digging also led to cached pages with an advertisement for a raffle, of all things, with bikes as prizes. The ad bore a phone number and, oddly, bank account information where people could send money to enter that raffle. And right there on the raffle’s ad, he came across a name: Ricardo Estrada Zamora. The man’s nickname, the web told him, was Ricky. Eventually, Hance discovered that the Constru-Bikes Facebook page hadn’t disappeared entirely; whoever was running the page had simply blocked users in the US from seeing it. Hance used a VPN to route his internet traffic through another country and regain access to the page. Now he could see both Constru-Bike’s Facebook page and its Insta account, and that bikes would appear for sale on both accounts, only to be taken off the Facebook page once they sold. Hance and the people helping him could now see the full scale and history of the business—and just how many bikes were coming and going. Soon, Hance and a volunteer found Zamora’s personal Facebook page. They saw that he lives in La Barca, a city of about 68,000 people in southern Jalisco, more than an hour outside Guadalajara. They also found ample evidence that Zamora and Constru-Bikes were one and the same. The same bicycles often appeared on his personal page. And for a period of time the owner of the Constru-Bikes Instagram page had forgotten to turn off the geotagging feature, so Hance could see that some images were tagged as La Barca. Hance also noticed that certain architectural features appeared in the background of many bike ads and in photos of proud customers standing with their new bikes. One day during my visit with Hance, he surfed over to Google Street View and typed in the address they had found for Zamora: There, within feet of the address, was a golden garage door; bits of an address on a wall; the same vibrant, tropical paint—the same details I could see clearly in the bike ads. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen A cyclist in Portland, Oregon, where bike thefts rose 20 percent during the pandemic. Zamora didn’t seem to be hiding at all, other than restricting his social media pages. Here was a picture of him with his wife and child on a hike, everyone having a great time. Here was a proud shot of his just-washed Volkswagen, its license plate clearly visible. And here was the man himself—mid-thirties, lean, handsome, with a dark, neat beard and Hilfiger shirt. Zamora was an active cyclist, and occasionally he wrote about local races or racers, or posted pictures of women cyclists dressed in snug racing kits, with leering captions underneath. Over time, Hance began to get to know Zamora in a way that was oddly intimate. The smiling, clean-cut portrait seemed incongruous with the crimes he was investigating. One day Zamora even complained on Facebook that a man he’d hired at his architecture and construction business had stolen a set of his tools and then vanished. In his next social media posts, Zamora—who would later, in a phone call with WIRED, deny having anything at all to do with selling bicycles—offered more stolen bikes for sale. By the summer of 2020, so many stolen bikes were being offered for sale on Constru-Bikes that Hance gave up trying to alert every victim. It was all he could do just to take screenshots of the ads, with all their photos, and file them away. There were hundreds of bikes, thousands of photos. Sometimes the listings didn’t even try to hide that a bike was stolen. One day Hance came across an ad for a candy-apple-red Intense Primer mountain bike that still bore a hang tag, or price tag. It read “$6,999” and said “Cambria Bike.” I know that name, Hance realized. On a stormy night over Super Bowl weekend 2019, thieves pulled up behind a 30,000-square-foot warehouse in Paso Robles, on the central coast of California. The building belonged to Cambria Bicycle Outfitters, a longtime bike seller. The thieves cut a hole in the warehouse’s wall, evaded a motion detector, and made off with roughly 90 bicycles worth nearly $500,000. “This is like Ocean’s 14,” Cambria CEO Clay Akey told a local TV news station. Several weeks later thieves stole two bikes worth about $10,000 from Cambria’s nearby showroom, Akey told WIRED. The thefts had been so damaging that Cambria lost its insurance carrier over the claim, then ended up paying more than double for a new policy. Now, one year later, Hance was looking at one of the bikes from these heists. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen One day, a volunteer found that Zamora had family in Silicon Valley and that he sometimes traveled there. They found Zamora’s personal Instagram account, which showed a picture he had posted of a stolen mountain bike resting beneath bruised skies in the treeless foothills above San Jose. “Testing what we sell,” the caption read, in Spanish. There were other pictures of Zamora with other bikes. Is he the Pink Panther of bike poachers, Hance wondered, swiping all of them himself during his trips north? But security camera footage collected from victims showed a wide variety of thieves. Ah, so he’s the tail end of the chain. And he’s clearly got help up here. To Hance, the fact that Zamora was an avid rider, a member of the cycling community, made his actions so much worse. It was not only a crime, it was betrayal. I spent days looking through hundreds of Zamora’s ads myself. For sale was a Ventum that had been custom painted in black, red, and gold to resemble the national flag of Germany, a Boo Bicycles road bike fashioned of bamboo and carbon fiber, and a hand-built Low MK1 racing bike that cost more than my used car. These were bikes to dream about. Zamora and his Facebook friends had slang for them: aviones. Airplanes. Bikes with wings. What struck me most was how casual and commercial the criminality was. Not many illicit enterprises print up their own trucker hats, with a logo, as Constru-Bikes did. The banality itself was a taunt. Zamora seemed to know that Uncle Sam’s long arm wasn’t long enough, or wasn’t resolute enough, to reach all the way to a town in central Mexico, to punish a guy for selling other people’s bikes. He appeared to feel no fear. Looking through the ads, I was awed by the scale of the operation, then made dizzy, and finally nauseated. “How do they do it?” a commenter on Constru-Bikes asked in Spanish one day beneath a post showing a pickup truck laden with a half-dozen more mountain bikes: the latest shipment. “Where does such beauty come from?” “Tenemos gente robando todo el mundo,” the Constru-Bikes account replied. We have people stealing all over the world. Several times, Hance tried to get police around the Bay Area interested in what he uncovered. For a little while at least, a cop at the San Francisco Police Department seemed to take an interest. But given everything else going on—the pandemic, racial justice protests, spikes in other crime—police seemed less able than ever to deal with stolen bikes. And cops didn’t seem to know what to do with this obsessed citizen, Hance, and the outlandish story he had to tell. Meanwhile, Zamora just kept making money: From late 2020 to June 2024, Hance estimates, Zamora may have sold some 654 bikes for a total of as much as $2.1 million. Bike Index tried to get Meta—then Facebook—to remove Constru-Bikes’ Facebook pages. The efforts hit a brick wall. The company directed Bike Index to click a button to report criminal behavior—“which does nothing,” said Hance. “We clicked it dozens of times,” he told me. “It’s like the button at the crosswalk.” He finally reached an engineer (and cyclist) at the company who said they'd relayed Hance’s concerns to a team that deals with such issues. The reply: The team is focused on other issues, and “there wasn’t much that could be done,” Hance relayed to me. “There’s just nobody at the helm, just nobody fucking driving the bus,” Hance said. (In an email, Meta told WIRED that it prohibits the selling or buying of stolen goods on Facebook and Instagram, and encourages people to report such activity—as Hance has done repeatedly—to the company and the police. The Constru-Bikes pages were still online as of press time.) By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen The league of bike hunters briefly considered charging down to Mexico and confronting Zamora, then quickly decided that option was insane. They weren’t violent vigilantes. Plus, they had no idea who Zamora might be in bed with. Finally, out of options, Hance and others decided Bike Index would publicly reveal Zamora online with a long post documenting what the group had uncovered over many months. And Bike Index would publish a huge database of every confirmed stolen bike that Constru-Bikes had posted for sale. It was hardly the satisfying conclusion anyone wanted. But it might dent Zamora’s business for a while—and perhaps pressure Meta to take down his page. “We can’t arrest guys. What I can do is paint the bad actors with the ugly brush,” Hance told me. Then, before they could do so, Hance finally caught the break he’d been hoping for. It was Valentine’s Day 2021. During a regular sweep of Zamora’s ads on Constru-Bikes, Hance figured out that Zamora had “gloriously fucked up.” Instead of simply posting a picture of a bike for sale, he had posted a screengrab taken from a smartphone which seemed to show an album of related photos. The album’s name was visible: “Victoriano.” Hance suspected he was looking at the name of Zamora’s US bike supplier. Almost immediately, someone at Constru-Bikes took down the photo. It was too late: Hance had grabbed a screenshot. Now, Hance again went on the hunt. On Facebook he found that Zamora had a friend named Victor Romero—short for Victoriano. Romero ran Tepeke Transmissions, an auto shop in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Well, that’s an intriguing coincidence. Hance surfed over to Tepeke Transmissions’ Facebook page. Pictures showed that Romero was a mountain biker too. He liked to ride in San Jose’s Alum Rock Park, where Zamora had ridden when he’d come to town. Romero straddled a different model bike in nearly every photo. And Romero appeared to advertise some of the same bikes that Zamora was selling. With every detail, the space between the men collapsed further. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen The clincher though, was a small detail that many people might overlook. Hance didn’t: Ads on Constru-Bikes often showed a stolen bike leaning against a backdrop of orange shelving. Now, Hance peered inside Tepeke Transmissions via the photos of the shop on Facebook. Boom—the same bright-orange shelves lined the walls of Romero’s business, all of them holding rows of greasy auto transmission cases. So this is the guy we’ve been looking for. This is the beginning of the pipeline that ends in Jalisco. In the late winter of 2021 Hance handed all of this information to the San Francisco law enforcement officer who’d shown some interest in his tips before. At the end of April, after investigating Hance’s tips, the San Francisco cops served a search warrant at Tepeke Transmissions and found Romero at the shop—along with a stolen Kona Process 153 mountain bike worth nearly $5,000, disassembled and packaged for shipment. The bike had been posted for sale on Constru-Bikes about a week earlier. They also found $206,000 in cash. News of the raid wasn’t made public, and Hance could only piece together hints of what had happened. But he was over the moon about it. Finally, Zamora’s reign might end. For a while, the pipeline to Mexico seemed seriously damaged. No new bikes appeared for sale. And then … nothing happened. Weeks turned into months. The waiting was agony. Sometimes, authorities contacted Hance to ask how to locate information on specific bikes that had been for sale, since he knew Zamora’s operation better than they did. Hance heard a rumor that because of the large cash seizure, the Feds might even take an interest in the case. But mostly he was kept in the dark, and he fumed. Meanwhile, Zamora’s operation revved up again. Within several weeks stolen bikes appeared for sale from other cities—San Diego, Los Angeles, the mountain-biking mecca of Bend, Oregon. Zamora was tapping new locales. He was selling stolen bikes from Colorado. He had branched into consignment, advertising stolen bikes on his popular page that others were selling elsewhere. This wasn’t a single pipeline, or even a damaged one. It was a hydra. One day in June 2022, Hance texted me a picture of a 2017 Lynskey Cooper CX that Zamora had put up for sale just hours before. The bike had been stolen just 20 minutes away from Hance’s home in Portland. Hance and the victim even had mutual friends. A few months later, Hance noticed more than a dozen bikes worth roughly $50,000—the majority of them stolen in Portland—appeared on Zamora’s site. Hance had been chasing his nemesis for two and a half years. Now, it was as if Zamora was reminding Hance that he was powerless to stop him. More than a year passed. One afternoon in early February 2024 my phone pinged with a message while I was driving. It was Hance: Hey! ITS FUCKIN GO TIME call me Arrest made 😀😀😀 As soon as I got good cell coverage I called Hance. Romero, he told me, had been arrested and indicted in federal court—nearly three years after police had descended on Tepeke Transmissions. So the Feds had taken an interest in stolen bikes after all. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Hance sounded ecstatic. The words tumbled from him as he speculated about what might happen next. The world-weariness that he so often put up like a shield had been lowered. Maybe, he ventured, the whole awful thing was about to be over, and Constru-Bikes would be shut down for good. But when I sent Hance the actual indictment, along with the press release from the US Attorney’s Office, his mood went south. It alleged that Romero was part of “a complex, international fencing operation” that bought its merchandise from known sellers of stolen bikes in the Bay Area, knowing they were stolen, and shipped them to Mexico. But the indictment only mentioned nine bikes—among them that pricey Bulls ebike whose owner played on five different San Francisco softball teams. The hundreds of other stolen bicycles that Hance had documented over the years were completely missing from the legal filing. “It’s like a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the whole thing,” he said. Worse, Zamora’s name didn’t even appear in the court documents. The indictment simply described an “Unindicted Co-Conspirator 1” based in Jalisco, who sold the smuggled bikes on social media accounts that were blocked outside Mexico, sometimes marketing them with photographs taken in front of his own home address. It was just as Hance’s detective work had laid out. But much to his frustration, Bike Index got no shout-out from the government. Hance felt defeated. Maybe, he wondered aloud, the Feds would move on Zamora later? But his voice no longer held any hope. He was exhausted. Hance was ready to close the book on Constru-Bikes. Bike Index would publish its massive, searchable database of four years of bikes Zamora had sold, many of which Bike Index could document as stolen, in hopes of busting wide open what the Feds had not. It would be a takedown, of a kind. Then he could move on from Zamora, and move on with his life, he told me. I doubted that he would, though. Hance wasn’t a guy to let go of things. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By Matt Kamen Romero has pleaded not guilty and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted on all charges. When we contacted him by phone, he asked to be texted, then didn’t return our messages. Reached by WIRED, Abraham Simmons of the US Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California wouldn’t comment on whether the investigation was now over or whether anyone else—in the US or Mexico—would ever be charged. And Zamora? Last week a translator and I called him in Mexico. To our surprise, he picked up the phone. He was polite, almost pleasant, addressing the translator cordially as “miss.” He said he didn’t know why we were asking about bikes. Didn’t he run the Constru-Bikes pages? we asked. “No,” he said. “I’m an architect.” You don’t sell bikes? “No.” The timbre of his voice became more brittle. Why do people think you sell stolen bikes? we asked. “Maybe because I’m a high-performance cyclist,” Zamora replied. Of course you’re a good friend of Victor Romero, we pressed. “I don’t know Victor,” he said. But Romero’s indictment clearly refers to you, we said. Why do you think the US government has got it wrong? “Maybe because I’m guapo,” he said. “Handsome.” He translated this last word into English himself. Now I recognized the same arrogant persona I’d gotten to know in years of Constru-Bikes posts. We mentioned the photos of bikes for sale in front of his house. “I don’t even have a house,” he said. Zamora was agitated now. We wanted to talk more, but he was done. He signed off with a vulgar anatomical slur, directed at the translator, then hung up. In the next day or so the Constru-Bikes Facebook page offered five more bikes for sale. Correction: 6/12/2024, 2:25 pm EST: A misspelling of Jorge Parrales’ name has been corrected.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED for those with hearing challenges, there’d long been just one option for dealing with it: an expensive, bulky hearing aid prescribed by a doctor. That changed in 2022 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter hearing aid devices, giving consumers access to a vast and growing array of alternatives. Today, there are more hearing aids than ever, and they come in all different shapes, sizes, and most importantly, prices. How does a $100 hearing aid compare to a $5,000 prescription device for treating mild to moderate hearing loss? We’ve been testing products for the past two years to answer that question. To help us out with this analysis, we brought in an expert. Licensed audiologist Ruth Reisman analyzed all of these hearing aids in a scientific lab setting, approving only models that amplified noises at safe levels. At the same time, I did hands-on (ears-on?) testing of these hearing aids around my home, outside, and in noisy environments. We found plenty to like on the market today—and plenty of aids we’d avoid. The Jabra Enhance Select 300 has the current crown as the best hearing aid, with the Eargo Link and Sony CRE-C10 close behind. Here’s our complete roundup of the best prescription and over-the-counter hearing aids we tested and approved. Special offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off).

Every person is unique, and so are their hearing loss needs. To find a device that suits your needs and lifestyle, consider these factors. For more tips, check out our guide on How to Buy a Hearing Aid. Hearing aids shouldn’t bankrupt you. With such a steep price and minimal insurance coverage, it’s no wonder why so many people put off hearing loss treatment. Between audiologist visits, hearing aid orders, custom fittings, and maintenance, it’s justifiable that you might postpone treatment rather than fork over your credit card. It’s vital that you know your budget before you start browsing for hearing aids. Many brands offer trial periods where you can test out the device for a set number of days and, if they’re a bad fit, return them free of charge. It doesn’t have to be obvious that you’re wearing a hearing aid. Despite cartoonish media depictions of hunched-over seniors screaming “WHAT?!” at every person who tries to talk to them, hearing loss doesn’t discriminate by age. With nearly 10 million Americans under the age of 60 affected, more should be taking advantage of the sleekly designed hearing aids on the market. Similar to the stigmas that keep people from seeking mental health treatment, the hearing loss community is plagued by self-consciousness when it comes to wearing these devices. Modern in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids have come a long way in subtlety. Opt for a professional hearing test over an online one. While online and app-based tests are a good way to dip your toes in and see whether you have hearing loss, a detailed audiogram that only an in-office visit can provide is a far better option. A hearing professional can use this audiogram to calibrate hearing aids to your specific needs. The latest model in Jabra’s elite line of hearing aids are not only the Danish company’s best offering yet, but they're also the best hearing aids on the market. With enhanced speech recognition and an excellent customer service network, the Enhance Select 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) stand out for their ability to match the quality of prescription hearing aids without requiring a prescription. These relatively small behind-the-ear (BTE) devices pair with the Enhance Select mobile app, allowing users to choose between four listening modes—All Around, Restaurant, Music, and Outdoor—though I found the All Around setting to work fine in most environments. Each mode can be customized and lets you further tweak preferences for speech clarity and noise filtering. The Select 300 are Bluetooth-compatible so you can stream media directly from a smartphone or tablet. And despite the rechargeable case being bulkier than most others on this list, it carries an impressive 72 hours of juice. Fully charged, the aids can last up to 30 hours off a single three-hour charging session. The Enhance Select 300’s best feature are not what it includes, but what it lacks: hiss. Most hearing aid wearers (myself included) are all too familiar with the unpleasant hiss or static noise that sometimes happens when you increase a hearing aid’s volume beyond about halfway. This model virtually eliminates feedback at even the highest volume levels. But with prescription-level quality comes prescription-level pricing, and at $1,695 a pair, the Enhance Select 300 certainly aren't cheap. You can get financing for as low as $52 per month with a three-year warranty. You can shave off $200 if you opt for the entry-level Enhance Select 100 model, but you’ll be sacrificing features like access to Jabra’s audiologist staff and professional adjustments. OTC. Compatible with iOS and Android. Battery life of 24 to 30 hours. The unfortunate reality of hearing aids is that they’re expensive. And at $799, the Eargo Link (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are certainly not cheap. But when you factor in their excellent noise reduction and directional microphones, you start to see how they're a relative bargain. The in-the-ear (ITE) design resembles wireless earbud headphones more than hearing aids, which lends a degree of subtlety. They’re also sweat-, splash-, and dust-resistant, so you can sport them on a rainy day or while you work out. Perhaps the best feature of the Eargo Link are its media streaming capabilities. The hearing aids match the bass boost and sound-blocking features you’d find in premium noise-canceling headphones. You can stream your favorite music, movies, and other media via Bluetooth or take phone calls with a tap. But these budget aids aren’t without their flaws. Unlike the much-pricier Eargo 7 model, the Link hearing aids do not work with a mobile app (the company says an app is on the way soon and will include customization options and a transparency mode). Anyone looking to adjust settings has to use touch controls on the Link to navigate through the four preset listening programs, which vary only when it comes to loudness and not much else. The Link also have a relatively weak rechargeable battery that lasts only around nine hours on a charge, so they’re not a great option for all-day wearers. OTC. Compatible with iOS and Android. Battery life of nine hours. As with any medical condition, you may not want every person you meet to know that you experience hearing loss. Unfortunately, quality hearing aids are as subtle as a pair of antlers. That’s where in-the-ear (ITE), also referred to as in-the-canal (ITC), hearing aids like the Sony CRE-C10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) come in handy. Developed in conjunction with WS Audiology, the C10s are virtually invisible when worn, with just a short retrieval wire hanging out that is noticeable only to someone looking for it. And they’re quite comfortable. Performance-wise, the C10 offer a crisp sound quality that rivals competitors charging twice as much. But beware: Instead of recharging a lithium-ion cell, the CRE-C10 rely on tiny disposable batteries that aren’t easy to swap out, especially if you have large fingers or dexterity issues. That said, those batteries pack a lot of juice: They run for 70 hours at a time. Sony’s rechargeable E10 model offer a different design and run an extra $200. OTC. Compatible with iOS and Android. Battery life of five to seven days. We've reviewed dozens of hearing aids, and many of them are good but not great. Here are alternatives to consider: Eargo 7 for $2,650: The Eargo 7 (7/10, WIRED Review) offer high-quality sound, and you can connect with an audiologist to fine-tune them to your ears. There are a few listening programs you can cycle through, but I didn't find the need to switch modes—they provided well-amplified audio no matter what I was doing. The main issue? They're needlessly expensive. Sony CRE-E10 for $998: The CRE-E10 (7/10, WIRED Review) aren't so much of an upgrade to the C10 we recommend above, but a different class of product. They're much more visible, though they look like a standard pair of Bluetooth earbuds. The E10 provide a comfortable fit but can get tiring after a long day. At least they use a rechargeable battery (via USB-C) with up to 26 hours on a single charge. You can control them only through Sony's app, and the hearing test lets you tune the frequency response of the aids. The audio experience is excellent at low volumes, though these aids have a bit of an echo and some additional noise. Still, I found it manageable. They do a decent job streaming media and calls via Bluetooth. Elehear Alpha Pro for $459: If you suffer from mild hearing loss, the Elehear Alpha Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) are worth a look. They're traditional-looking hearing aids, and new users get a free 30-minute session with an audiologist to get them set up. There are several modes you can cycle through in the app to boost the volume and decrease ambient noise, plus you can tweak the presets Elehear offers, though a lot of this is trial and error. They have good battery life—around 20 hours on a single charge—and did not deplete for me after using them for a full day. You can pop them into a carrying case that can recharge them up to seven more times. Signia Pure Charge&Go IX for $4,000+: These prescription aids require professional fitting by an audiologist, either online or in person. These were initially some of the least impactful hearing aids I've tested; they didn't amplify conversations the way Signia promised. However, after significant tuning with Signia's in-house doctor and my own audiologist (they pored over settings in the Signia administration app not accessible to end users), they dramatically boosted conversation volumes. Clearly, you can fine-tune the listening experience a great deal. Unfortunately, the pricing is set by the audiologist and ranges from $4,000 to $10,000. Starkey Genesis AI for $2,500+: There are few things anyone loathes more than a low battery warning. Enter the Starkey Genesis AI, a discreet behind-the-ear (BTE) prescription hearing aid that can last a whopping 51 hours on a single charge. The hearing aids come with software developed by the company that uses broadband white noise for tinnitus masking, and they can be programmed by an audiologist to address your condition. If you want to make adjustments, the My Starkey app has customizable settings and even tracks various health data, like your daily steps. It's not all rosy, though. For starters, the Genesis AI forgo the small and clear retrieval wire found on most hearing aids for a plastic shard that sticks out from both sides of your head like pegs. I also experienced a significant amount of background hum and hiss during testing, making them a better fit for outdoor environments where there’s more noise to drown it out. The Bluetooth pairing was also a little finicky and required tech support from the retailer YesHearing. At this price, expect to lean liberally on your doctor to fine-tune settings. Our hearing aid testing was conducted by myself and licensed audiologist Ruth Reisman. First, we sent devices to Reisman to test for effectiveness and safety. In her laboratory in Brooklyn, New York, Reisman used a Verifit 2 test box, also known as a hearing aid analyzer, to evaluate the performance of each hearing aid per the standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). She placed each device in the box, testing the hearing aids’ sound frequencies and listening comfort against the audiogram of a test patient with mild to moderate hearing loss. Reisman also used speech mapping to visually record the test box results, creating simple graphs that show how a hearing aid’s output would sound in a patient’s ear. These graphs even show how audible certain sounds are, including soft, moderate, and loud. The final parameter tested was how the devices fared when faced with extremely loud noises to ensure they could control for UCL (uncomfortable loudness), to avoid causing further damage. Based on these results, Reisman weeded out unsafe or poorly performing hearing aids and identified devices we would test further. I configured and qualitatively tested each device in several settings, including my home, outdoors, and crowded environments, to see how well they helped treat my mild hearing loss while more deeply evaluating the user experience. I tried charging rechargeable models, changing batteries if disposable, connecting Bluetooth features, and cleaning the devices. I also compared them based on overall look and style—style matters. We pooled together Reisman’s data and my first-hand observations to determine the recommendations above. Before you choose which hearing aid is right for you, it’s best to familiarize yourself with the different styles on the market. While you may see multiple design styles, hearing aids essentially boil down to two main varieties: behind-the-ear and in-the-ear. Completely-in-canal (CIC) devices also exist, but none are available over the counter. Here are common terms you’ll see: Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids, also known as over-the-ear, are probably the most traditional style. For these devices, an often bulky plastic case rests on the back of your ear while a tube delivers sound to an earmold. Because they’re bigger, they tend to have the most technology and can cater to higher degrees of hearing loss. That said, they also tend to stand out more, which is a drawback for those looking for subtlety. Receiver-in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids are essentially the same as behind-the-ear devices, with a receiver component that sits in the ear canal instead of being built into the case. Though the industry likes to tout them as a sleeker, less noticeable counterpart, in actuality they’re not much smaller than BTEs and function identically. In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids, also known as in-the-canal (ITC), are more comparable to wireless earbuds from a design standpoint. These devices allow for directional mics but also tend to collect moisture and wax. Completely-in-canal (CIC) hearing aids are the most “invisible” hearing aids on the market. This is because, as the name suggests, they’re completely submerged in your ear canal with nothing sticking out (besides a tiny string for removal). They typically have to be inserted by a professional and left in the ear for longer periods, and as noted, they are not available over the counter. How much money should you expect to spend on a hearing aid? The answer depends primarily on whether you’re looking into over-the-counter or prescription hearing aids. Unsurprisingly, the latter is a wallet guzzler, with average costs between $2,000 to $8,000. But OTCs can ring up quite a tab in their own right, and our most highly rated devices will still run you about $800 to $2,000 a pair. So far, we haven’t found an OTC device under this $800 price that is truly effective at treating hearing loss. In most cases, the $100 budget devices now flooding the market are too good to be true. Fortunately, there are several methods to manage the high cost of a hearing aid: Financing is available for virtually all reputable hearing aid companies, so you may not need to pay everything up front. Some plans are offered directly through the company, while others may require a third-party financing company like Klarna or Care Credit. If you are over the age of 65, you may qualify for an add-on Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) that may include hearing-related benefits. Most private insurance providers don’t offer hearing exam and device coverage, though some may have the option to add it as a supplemental benefit. Medicaid coverage in certain states also pays for hearing aids, provided the prescription brand accepts it. Veterans may also qualify for hearing aid coverage through their VA benefits. Some state governments have programs to help their constituents front the costs of hearing aids. Call or write to your state department to see whether this is a service they offer. Just as important as what hearing aids to buy are what hearing aids not to buy. While some of these devices are affordable, most are lacking in quality or style. After our testing, we don’t wholly recommend these hearing aids. (Poor hearing aids can harm your hearing.) Audien Atom One for $98: I had high hopes for these (5/10, WIRED Review) but they're impossibly cheap. The Atom One come up short on smart features, as there’s no way to fine-tune these devices. Lexie Lumen for $799: These are comically large and dated. The case was physically falling apart during testing, which I wouldn’t expect from hearing aids at this price. Though they sound fine, they’re far from subtle and were plagued with connectivity bugs. Olive Union Olive Max for $299: The Olive Max (6/10, WIRED Review) are big and look like a Bluetooth headset from the early 2000s (except for both of your ears). You can use an app to fine-tune the listening experience, but the overall hearing aid performance was mixed and I experienced a steady, buzzing background noise. They were pretty unusable in loud environments too. That said, they work well as standard wireless earbuds. Audicus Spirit 2 for $99: These missed the mark in sound quality and technology. They had an annoying hiss in quiet environments, an outdated micro-USB charger, and a tedious Bluetooth setup. Ceretone Core One for $349: The mandatory app required to control these hearing aids is so basic that it's useless (5/10, WIRED Review). You can't tune the frequencies, and the listening experience is quite blunt. They're also not comfortable to wear for long periods. Sennheiser All-Day Clear for $950: Considering the price, these hearing aids (3/10, WIRED Review) are not effective and have a significant background hiss problem. They're bulky and difficult to position. Linner Nova OTC for $300: The AirPods-like Linner Nova (3/10, WIRED Review) amplify environmental sound and can double as streaming earbuds, but do neither particularly well.

19,Will Knight,"Apple Proved That AI Is a Feature, Not a Product",https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-ai-feature-not-product/,"Other tech companies want to sell you chatbots. Apple’s demos show the value of seeing the AI as an integrated, holistic experience rather than a stand-alone app or device.",2024-06-13T16:00:00Z,"Will Knight Apple's otherworldly, flying-saucer headquarters in Cupertino, California, felt like a suitable venue this week for a bold and futuristic revamp of the company’s most prized products. With iPhone sales slowing and rivals gaining ground thanks to the rise of tools like ChatGPT, Apple offered its own generative artificial intelligence vision at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). Apple has lately been perceived as a generative AI laggard. Its WWDC offerings failed to persuade some critics, who have branded WWDC’s announcements as downright boring. But with the focus on infusing existing apps and OS features with what the company calls “Apple Intelligence,” the big takeaway is that generative AI is a feature rather than a product in and of itself. The dazzling abilities demonstrated by ChatGPT has inspired some startups to try inventing entirely dedicated AI hardware—like the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin—as a means of harnessing generative AI. Unfortunately, these gadgets have been underwhelming and frustrating to use in practice. By contrast, Apple’s vertical integration of generative AI across so many products and different software seems much likelier where AI is headed. Rather than a stand-alone device or experience, Apple has focused on how generative AI can improve apps and OS features in small yet meaningful ways. Early adopters have certainly flocked to generative AI programs like ChatGPT for help redrafting emails, summarizing documents, and generating images, but this has typically meant opening another browser window or app, cutting and pasting, and trying to make sense of a chatbot’s sometimes fevered ramblings. To be truly useful, generative AI will need to seep into technology we already use in ways we can better understand and trust. After the WWDC keynote, Apple gave WIRED a demo of what it calls Apple Intelligence, a catchall name to account for AI running across several apps. The capabilities hardly push the boundaries of generative AI, but they are thoughtfully integrated and perhaps even limited in ways that will encourage users to trust them more. A feature called Writing Tools will let iOS and MacOS users rewrite or summarize text, and Image Playground will turn sketches and text prompts into stylized illustrations. The company’s new Genmoji tool, which uses generative AI to dream up new emojis from a text prompt, may turn out to be a surprisingly popular integration given how frequently people fling emojis at one another. Apple is also giving Siri a much-needed upgrade with generative AI that helps the assistant better understand speech including pauses and corrections, recall previous chats for better context awareness, and tap into data stored in apps on a device to be more useful. Apple said that Siri will use the App Intents, a framework for developers that can be used to perform actions that involve opening and operating apps. When asked “show me photos of my cat chasing a toy,” for example, a language model will parse the command and then use the framework to access Photos. Apple’s generative AI will mostly run locally on its devices, although the company has developed a technique called Private Cloud Compute to send queries to the cloud securely when necessary. Running AI on a device means it will be less capable than the latest cloud-based chatbot. But this may be a feature rather than a bug, as it also means that a program like Siri is less likely to over-extend itself and mess up. Apple is rather cleverly handing its most challenging queries over to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, with a user’s permission. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Investors apparently approve of Apple’s announcements, but we’ll have to wait a while to see how well it really works. The technology won’t roll out until later this year in beta, and even then it will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and computers using Apple’s M series of chips. That could make the experience a little choppy for those of us who’ve hung on to older devices. You can also expect people to push features like Genmoji to misbehave. After Meta launched AI-generated “stickers” last year, people began creating unwelcome images, including heavily armed Mario characters. The shift to AI as a feature and not a product is a welcome one after so much ChatGPT hype, and it can also be seen in other recent announcements. Google and Microsoft both went big on AI at their developer events this year, but they also tried to emphasize more practical use cases, including tools built into Gmail or Copilot in Windows. Even OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI boom and offers the most compelling AI product around in ChatGPT, seems to currently be more focused on making the interface more natural and compelling, and even a bit flirty. Thankfully, Apple says that for the time-being it will focus on using generative AI to make Siri more useful rather than overly familiar."
20,Joel Khalili,Sellers Call Amazon’s Buy Box ‘Abusive.’ Now They’re Suing,https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-buy-box-under-attack-again/,"UK retailers have accused Amazon of using its Buy Box section to choke their businesses, reigniting a years-long debate over whether there was foul play.",2024-06-13T09:00:00Z,"Joel Khalili In 2015, merchants selling their wares on Amazon began to notice that whenever one of their products began to fly off the virtual shelves, the e-commerce powerhouse itself would seem to quickly come out with its own, cheaper version. Unable to compete on price, the retailers’ own sales would begin to tail off. They soon started to suspect something fishy was going on. Nine years later, they have decided to act. Last week, retailers in the UK filed a $1.27 billion class action against Amazon, accusing the company of abusing a position of strength to squeeze third-party sellers on its marketplace and boost sales of its own products. The lawsuit, the largest class action ever filed by retailers in the UK, alleges that Amazon misused data belonging to sellers on its platform to selectively undercut them with competing products of its own. The retailers claim that Amazon used its Buy Box—which features the conspicuous “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons and through which the majority of sales are alleged to be made—to push those own-brand products, thereby unfairly depriving competitors of sales. The effect of this “abusive conduct,” the plaintiffs claim, has been felt particularly acutely among “smaller independent retailers” already struggling to stay afloat in difficult market conditions. “Life is tough for retailers. It’s a hard sector anyway, without the biggest factor in the marketplace using its position of dominance,” says Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), the industry body that filed the claim on behalf of retailers. “It’s incredibly frustrating that the company hosting the marketplace is able to quickly replicate what you’ve got, give it preferential treatment, and basically steal your market.” In a statement, Amazon rejected the allegations as baseless. “Over 100,000 small- and medium-size businesses in the UK sell on Amazon’s store, more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners, and the fact is that we only succeed when the businesses we work with succeed,” says James Upsher, an Amazon spokesperson. The debate surrounding the legality of Amazon’s data usage and its alleged manipulation of the Buy Box has taken various forms over half a decade. In 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced it was launching an investigation into Amazon’s use of sensitive data from independent retailers. In 2022, the UK markets regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), followed suit with an investigation of its own. Both probes were resolved after Amazon promised not to use sellers’ data to advantage its retail division, and to assess all products objectively when filling the Buy Box. The company was not required to admit to any violations. In June 2023, a class action was brought in the UK on behalf of consumers, alleging that Amazon built the algorithm that populates the Buy Box to prioritize revenue maximization over the interests of customers. This was followed in September that year by a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the Federal Trade Commission, the US antitrust regulator, and more than a dozen state attorneys general, accusing the firm of abusing the Buy Box “to discipline sellers who offer lower-priced goods elsewhere.” These lawsuits are yet to be resolved. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The latest UK class action, brought by the retailers, seeks financial compensation for the company’s alleged historical practices. “The most obvious and principal effect is a loss of revenue and profits. Amazon is taking sales away from merchants, having been able to use competitor data to bring to market its own products,” claims Boris Bronfentrinker, partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and counsel to the plaintiffs. “When companies acquire market power, they have to act with a certain responsibility. It’s not free and open to them to do what they want.” But despite the numerous existing investigations and allegations that thread a similar line, the retailers face hurdles. Bronfentrinker claims the case is “nailed on,” because the commitments made to the EC and CMA amount effectively to an acknowledgement by Amazon that it violated competition law: “The smoking gun is their own admission that they are going to stop doing it,” he says. But in practice, says Kathryn McMahon, an associate professor of law at the University of Warwick, the retailers will have to build a case from scratch, because no formal violation by Amazon has yet been recorded. “The whole advantage in entering into the commitments is that there is not an admission,” she says. Therefore, the retailers will first have to establish that Amazon is dominant in the UK market, something the company is likely to contest, says McMahon, and then prove that Amazon abused that position in a way that caused damage to sellers on its platform. “That’s the tricky point,” she says. The case that Amazon abused its dominance is built atop a little-tested principle of competition law: self-preferencing. The idea is that large digital platforms should not be allowed to abuse their strength in a particular market—say, e-commerce—to advance other areas of their business at the expense of potential competitors. In 2017, the EU found Google had violated its antitrust law by engaging in self-preferencing—specifically, using its dominance in the advertising business to give prominent placement to its own shopping services. In May, the UK put in place new rules built to prevent damage caused by self-preferencing. But there is limited precedent around which the claimants in the Amazon case can build their argument. “Self-preferencing has been prominent as a theory of harm only in the past ten years,” says Niamh Dunne, associate professor of law at the London School of Economics. “It’s an area still somewhat up for grabs.” In the absence of a wealth of legal precedent, the case will hinge to some degree on the interpretation of the difference between sensible business strategy and anticompetitive self-preferencing. It is not illegal in itself for Amazon to run an online marketplace, use it to sell its own products, and deliver the goods through its own logistics service, even though doing so might give it a competitive advantage. “One of the complications with self-preferencing is that vertically integrated organizations do it all the time. It can have negative effects for competitors, but it’s also such a natural thing for firms to do,” says Dunne. It may be open to Amazon, then, to argue that it has simply been following “the law of the jungle,” she says. Before these kinds of arguments can play out, the retailers’ lawsuit must first be certified by the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal, which is not expected to reach a decision on whether the case can proceed until early next year. The retailers are content to wait for their day in court. “If this class action reinforces the changes recommended by the European Commission and CMA, and companies like Amazon realize they cannot treat partners in this way, then we’ve achieved something,” says Goodacre. “[Amazon is] quite an avaricious company. I say that with a grudging admiration. But it comes at a cost to someone.”"
21,Aarian Marshall,NYC’s Congestion Pricing Should Have Been the Future,https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-should-have-been-the-future/,"New York City was set to launch an ambitious plan to make people pay more to drive on busier roads, but cars won—again.",2024-06-07T18:02:48Z,"Aarian Marshall On Wednesday, New York governor Kathy Hochul shocked the state and the country when she announced she would indefinitely shelve New York City’s long-in-development congestion pricing scheme. The policy, in the works since 2007 and set to begin in just three weeks, was designed to relieve car traffic, curb road deaths, and send a billion dollars in annual funding to the city’s transit system by charging drivers up to $15 a day to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan, with rates highest at “peak hours.” (Truck drivers and some bus drivers could have paid more than $36 daily.) At heart, the idea is straightforward, if controversial: Make people pay for the roads they use. But congestion pricing was also set to become one of the most ambitious American climate projects, maybe ever. It was meant to coax people out of their gas-guzzling vehicles, which are alone responsible for some 22 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, and onto subways, buses, bicycles, and their feet. Policymakers, researchers, and environment nerds the world over have concluded that, even if the transition to electric vehicles were to happen at lightning speed, avoiding the worst of climate change is going to require fewer cars overall. Now, the movement has seen a serious setback, in a country where decades of car-centric planning decisions mean many can only imagine getting around in one very specific way. Just a few years ago, cities from Los Angeles to San Francisco to Chicago began to study what pricing roads might look like. “Cities were watching to see what would happen in New York,” says Sarah Kaufman, who directs the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation. “Now they can call it a ‘failure’ because it didn't go through.” On Wednesday, Hochul said her about-face had to do with concerns about the city’s post-pandemic recovery. The congestion pricing plan faced lawsuits from New Jersey, where commuters argue they would face unfair financial burdens. Cameras and gantries, acquired and positioned to charge drivers while entering the zone, have already been installed in Manhattan, to the tune of some $500 million. Kaufman, who says she was “flabbergasted” by Governor Hochul’s sudden announcement, says she is not sure where the policy goes from here. “If we can’t make courageous, and potentially less popular, moves in a city that has transit readily accessible, then I’m wondering where this can happen,” she says. Other global cities have seen success with congestion schemes. London’s program, implemented in 2003, is still controversial among residents, but the government reports it has cut traffic in the targeted zone by a third. One 2020 study suggests the program has reduced pollutants, though exemptions for diesel buses have blunted its emissions effects. Stockholm’s program, launched in 2006, upped the city’s transit ridership, reduced the number of total miles locals traveled by car, and decreased emissions between 10 and 14 percent. But in New York, the future of the program is unclear, and local politicians are currently scrambling to figure out how to cover the transit budget hole that would result from a last-minute nixing of the fee scheme. The city’s transit system is huge and sprawling: Five million people ride the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s buses and subways, almost double the number that fly every day in the US. In New York, drivers entering the zone below Manhattan’s 60th Street would have been charged peak pricing of $15, but would have only faced the charge once a day. They would have paid $3.75 for off-peak hours. Taxi and ride-hail trips in the zone would have seen extra fees. After years of controversy and public debate, the state had carved out some congestion charge exemptions: some vehicles carrying people with disabilities would not have been charged, lower-income residents of the zone would have received a tax credit for their tolls; and low-income drivers would have been eligible for a 50 percent discount.

22,Adrienne So,Fitbit Ace LTE Review: The Best Kid's Smartwatch,https://www.wired.com/review/fitbit-ace-lte/,Fitbit’s kids’ smartwatch is a location tracker as well as a gaming and communication device. It should keep my kids off phones for another few years.,2024-06-11T11:30:00Z,"Adrienne So If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 8/10 As an adult, we’ve all become inured to fitness tracker gamification—all the funny little incentives to up your step count and get moving. It’s wild to see a child experience fitness gamification for the first time, especially since most children have too much energy to begin with. The Ace LTE, Fitbit’s new smartwatch for kids, incentivizes children between the ages of 7 and 14 to wear their combination fitness tracker, location sharer, and communication device with a proprietary games studio called Fitbit Arcade. The child can unlock activity-based games with a certain number of steps, and it’s time-limited, so they can play for only a few minutes at a time. It also has an eSIM with built-in LTE connectivity, so you and your child can text and call each other, and you can locate them in Google Maps. Tap to Pay via Google Wallet is also coming soon. This watch solves a lot of problems for me and my elementary-school-aged children. However, I’m not sure that Google’s beta testers have adequately prepared their software engineers for my two kids, who, if they see that they need 1,500 more steps to unlock a game, will sprint around the house at top speed for 20 minutes until they get them. The Ace LTE smartwatch comes in two colorways: Spicy Pebble and Mild Pebble. Both have a stainless steel case with plastic buttons and a polyester woven strap with a plastic clasp. It’s about 41 by 45 mm across—so, it’s sizable, but nothing that my 7-year-old and 9-year-old feel is unwieldy. The only time my son wants to take it off is when he’s playing violin. It’s a Fitbit, so it works with both Android and Apple phones. It has a 5 ATM rating, which means it can withstand the pressure exerted by 50 meters of water. However, while it offers some protection, it doesn't have a dustproof rating. The screen is made from Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with an OLED panel that is plenty bright enough to see in natural daylight. It also comes with a protective plastic bumper; I asked my daughter whether she wanted to take it off so her watch would look a little more grown-up, and she said no. It may be a child’s smartwatch, but it is a Fitbit, and it does have the full suite of sensors—an accelerometer, optical heart rate sensor, magnetometer, ambient light sensor, and gyroscope. Multiple people have asked me, incredulously, whether I think it’s accurate when it says that my son is racking up between 16,000 to 20,000 steps a day. All I have to say is, you wouldn’t ask me that question if you could see him on our trampoline. At the end of a full day—from 6:30 am to around 7:30 pm for my kids—the battery is down to around 13 or 20 percent, which is a little less than the 16-plus hours that Google advertises, but it works for us. Every night, I put it on the charger after they go to bed at 8 pm, and they’re always fully charged by the time I go to bed at around 10 pm. Fitbit Ace LTE Rating: 8/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED To use the watch, you have to subscribe to Ace Pass ($10 per month), which is both the subscription service for Fitbit Arcade and a data plan. It uses GPS positioning and built-in 4G LTE connectivity. You don’t have to add a cell line to your phone plan to keep it connected. We are an Apple family, and it does take a little bit longer to locate my kids via the Ace versus pinging my husband’s location on his phone or Apple Watch on Find My. However, it’s not a distressingly long period and it works. In addition to text messaging, it has a built-in microphone and speaker that work quite well for calls—not quite as good as the Apple Watch, but better than a Garmin. Calls and texts work through the Fitbit Ace app, but since I have notifications from the app on my phone, I don't miss them (sometimes to my chagrin—you can get only so many poop emoji texts in one day before it stops being funny). You, the parent, must add trusted contacts via the app, and those contacts must also download the Fitbit Ace app. I cannot group chat, sadly. Many parents are anxious about giving their children a smart device. I empathize with the longing for a simpler time, but with vigilance, a smart device has opened my children up to the world, not shut them away from it. My anxious first-grader, whom I used to have to accompany to all birthday parties and field trips, goes by himself now that he can text me if he feels bad. My third-grader walks and bikes to her friends’ houses alone, learning independence, resilience, and how to check street signs along the way. It’s important not to mistake correlation for causation. Are kids today anxious and less active because they have smartphones? Or is it because parents are busier, and not everyone lives in enclaves where the parents all know each other and are usually at home, and where it’s easy for children to travel between the park, school, and each other’s houses?

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED But I digress. We used to use Apple Watches for this purpose, but even with Family Setup, Apple Watches are retooled grown-up devices for children. As such, they’re a little more confusing to use. Parental controls can be wonky. My kids also didn’t want to wear them every day. I added their watches to my cell phone plan but they use them mainly as walkie-talkies and never charge them. The Ace is much easier to use. Safety-wise, Google does not take your children’s health data as Apple does with an Apple Watch for research; it deletes location history after 24 hours and all health data after 30 days. It also includes other safety features—for example, you can turn off Location Accuracy, which leverages Google’s Find My network to ping other devices and wireless signals around your child to pinpoint their location more accurately. At $230, it's expensive for a kids' smartwatch, but not as expensive as an Apple Watch. The game options are also surprisingly alluring. Taking steps not only unlocks games but also helps you outfit your Eejie and keep it healthy. An Eejie is Fitbit's proprietary personalized character that I can describe only as your Fitbit Tamagotchi. My kids got their Aces and immediately friended each other. In addition to living in bedrooms next to each other, their Eejies now live in adjoining houses in Bit Valley, where the bickering can continue in a virtual space as well as in real life. The games are appealing and surprisingly fun, if weird. My daughter’s favorite is the fishing game, Smokey Lake, while my son’s is Kaiju Golf; it is strange to happen on them in the living room, pantomiming sports. While you can lock down the games during the day with the built-in School Time mode, I count this as a misstep on the part of the developers; since you can unlock games by increasing your step count, all my children do is … run around more. Oh, to be 7 years old and able to get in 1,600 steps with a quick half-hour on the trampoline! They play on their watches more than I expected and I had to take them away during dinner. Fitbit Ace LTE Rating: 8/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The other possible misstep is that kids change so rapidly during this time. My kids are at the exact perfect ages for this device—they can read, they like games, and they’re more independent. But they’re also, you know, still kids. It’s aimed at children up to age 14, but my 9-year-old has already expressed skepticism about how childlike it looks. An Apple Watch would be able to grow with them more easily. My kids really like the Ace. They wake up every morning, pick them up off the charger, and put them on, as automatically as my husband or I put on our smartwatches, which I am OK with because they’re not (always) using them to play. Most importantly, other parents who have kids in soccer practice and bassoon lessons have also asked whether they should get one. The Ace solves a real problem for many working parents. I have a feeling other kids may be joining mine in Bit Valley and on the real sidewalks around our houses very soon.

We've been talking a lot on this show about how disruptive AI is for elections this year. Generative AI is making it harder than ever to tell what's real and what's not in our politics. People are creating fake audio and video of politicians, celebrities, anyone really, and then using that content to try and spread disinformation and sway election results. Not only that, but the AI platforms themselves, like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, are refusing to clearly state the real winner of the 2020 US election. We'll talk about that later in the show. But first, I really didn't think that I could be thrown off by much anymore when it came to the use of AI in politics. But this week, WIRED reporter Vittoria Elliott published two stories that, to be honest, totally caught me by surprise. There are actual AI candidates on the ballot right now. Not one, but two chatbots are running for elected office. Tori managed to interview both the AI candidates and their developers. Tori, hi. I have so many questions. But first, can you just tell us what's going on? Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. It's crazy. There are two candidates on actual ballots this year, at least that we know of, there might be more. One is in the UK, and that is AI Steve. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: AI Steve. Vittoria Elliott: The other is called VIC, and he's running for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming. I actually talked to both people behind these bots this week. Leah Feiger: Let's actually take them one at a time. The candidate on the ballot in Wyoming is just called VIC? How did it end up on the ballot? Vittoria Elliott: The guy behind it, his name is Victor Miller. He's a self-proclaimed public records nerd. This all started because he requested some public records from the state of Wyoming, and he wanted to do it anonymously. He was told, he says, by a city officer, that he couldn't do that. Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: I asked our public records ombudsmen if that's correct and she said, ""No, that's not correct. They can't do that. It goes against state statutes."" I got to thinking, ""Well, darn. Why don't they just go by the law? Why don't they know the law?"" Vittoria Elliott: He was like, ""Wouldn't it be better if there was someone or something that knew all the laws and could follow them?"" Leah Feiger: Enter vote robot. Vittoria Elliott: Enter VIC. Leah Feiger: Got it. To clarify, is VIC the bot actually on the ballot, or is it Miller? Can constituents actually literally vote for these AI candidates? Vittoria Elliott: In Wyoming, you have to be a real person to run for office. Leah Feiger: That makes sense. That feels like a good rule to me. Vittoria Elliott: That means that the actual person on the ballot is Victor. He went to register with the county clerk to run for office, put VIC as his name there. He didn't know what he was going to name the bot. When he came back from registering, he told the bot, ""I've done this,"" blah, blah, blah. He said that the bot actually came up with the acronym Virtual Integrated Citizen. What his campaign promises is that even if he, Victor, is on the ballot, the decisions, particularly document-based decisions where you've got to read 400 pages of something to be able to know what a good policy thing would be, or you've got to read a lot of constituent feedback, et cetera. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: That all of those votes will be 100% decided by VIC. He literally described himself to me as the bot's meat puppet. The person who's going to go to the meetings, and do the voting, and do all the corporal embodied things one does as mayor. Leah Feiger: So the chatbot will be just analyzing all of this material and then making decisions? Vittoria Elliott: Yes. Leah Feiger: You got a fun letter from Wyoming's Secretary of State about this, and just the legalities around it. Tell us a little bit about that. Vittoria Elliott: Right. The Wyoming Secretary of State, they actually can't certify who runs on a ballot, that's the county clerk. But they sent a letter to the county clerk basically saying, ""We think that VIC,"" whether it's Victor Miller or the bot, ""violates both the letter and the spirit of the law."" And encouraging the county clerk to reject Victor Miller's bid for candidacy. But it's a little tough right now, because Victor says he's the one on the ballot. Of course, because he's a public records nerd who reads the laws— By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: When I asked him whether or not it was legal for a bot to be running, he said no. Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: It's not legal for an AI to run for office, hence why we need meat puppets at this point. Vittoria Elliott: But I've read the statutes, and they just require that you use the name that you commonly go by. He said his nickname is Vic, he commonly goes by that, so he's not doing anything wrong. Leah Feiger: VIC the bot runs OpenAI's ChatGPT. What did they have to say about this? Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. I reached out to OpenAI on Tuesday. They were very surprised. I don't think this was a use case they had thought of. Leah Feiger: Oh my God. This is a movie. This is the beginning of a bad movie. Scarlett Johansson, are you available? Again. Vittoria Elliott: OpenAI responded to us and told us that they had ""taken action"" against this particular bot because it violated their policies around election campaigning. We don't actually really know any more about what sort of policy it violated, or if this was a reactive thing. I asked Miller about this, if he had asked OpenAI for permission. He said no, but he recognized that maybe the bot would get taken down. He suggested he might move it to Llama, which is the open source model that was put out by Meta. That's not really controlled by a company. That's something that anyone can build on. It's way looser, in terms of rules and regulations. We may end up seeing VIC move from ChatGPT to Llama 3. Leah Feiger: Historically, Meta has just done really well by US elections over the last eight years. Vittoria Elliott: Oh, totally. Leah Feiger: I'm just sure that this will go off without a hitch. Tell me more about VIC the bot. What are the political leanings of VIC the bot? Is VIC a Democrat or a Republican? Vittoria Elliott: I asked VIC actually, if it felt aligned with any national party. VIC responded, literally responded to that question and said that, ""It was dedicated to taking the best ideas of both parties and integrating them to do what was best for the people of Cheyenne."" But that it didn't necessarily feel a political affiliation, either way. VIC [Archival audio clip]: I prioritize open data and clear communication with citizens, fostering a strong local economy by supporting small businesses and startups, and embracing new technologies to improve public services and infrastructure. Leah Feiger: I just really want to emphasize that, obviously you are a politics reporter, you are a very good one. You interview candidates all the time. You literally just interviewed a robot candidate and it's developer. When you are saying that VIC told you, the bot told you. Vittoria Elliott: Yes. Miller and I were on speakerphone. I asked him the question. He then asked VIC that question. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: She's asking what policies are most important to you, VIC? VIC [Archival audio clip]: The most important policies to me focus on transparency, economic development, and innovation. Leah Feiger: That is so bizarre. I got to ask, could VIC be exposed to other sources of information other than these public records? Say, email from a conspiracy theorist who wants VIC to do something not so good with elections that would not represent its constituents. Vittoria Elliott: Great question. I asked Miller, ""Hey, you've built this bot on top of ChatGPT. We know that sometimes there's problems or biases in the data that go into training these models. Are you concerned that VIC could imbibe some of those biases or there could be problems?"" He said, ""No, I trust OpenAI. I believe in their product."" You're right. He decided, because of what's important to him as someone who cares a lot about Cheyenne's governance, to feed this bot hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of pages of what are called supporting documents. The kind of documents that people will submit in a city council meeting. Whether that's a complaint, or an email, or a zoning issue, or whatever. He fed that to VIC. But you're right, these chatbots can be trained on other material. He said that he actually asked VIC, ""What if someone tries to spam you? What if someone tries to trick you? Send you emails and stuff."" VIC apparently responded to him saying, ""I'm pretty confident I could differentiate what's an actual constituent concern and what's spam, or what's not real."" Leah Feiger: I guess I would just say to that, one-third of Americans right now don't believe that President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, but I'm so glad this robot is very, very confident in its ability to decipher dis and misinformation here. Vittoria Elliott: Totally. Leah Feiger: That was VIC in Wyoming. Tell us a little more about AI Steve in the UK. How is it different from VIC? Vittoria Elliott: For one thing, AI Steve is actually the candidate. Leah Feiger: What do you mean actually the candidate? Vittoria Elliott: He's on the ballot. Leah Feiger: Oh, OK. There's no meat puppet? Vittoria Elliott: There is a meat puppet, and that Steve Endicott. He's a Brighton based business man. He describes himself as being the person who will attend Parliament, do the human things. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: But people, when they go to vote next month in the UK, they actually have the ability not to vote for Steve Endicott, but to vote for AI Steve. Leah Feiger: That's incredible. Oh my God. How does that work? Vittoria Elliott: The way they described it to me, Steve Endicott and Jeremy Smith, who is the developer of AI Steve, the way they've described this is as a big catchment for community feedback. On the backend, what happens is people can talk to or call into AI Steve, can have apparently 10,000 simultaneous conversations at any given point. They can say, ""I want to know when trash collection is going to be different."" Or, ""I'm upset about fiscal policy,"" or whatever. Those conversations get transcribed by the AI and distilled into these are the policy positions that constituents care about. But to make sure that people aren't spamming it basically and trying to trick it, what they're going to do is they're going to have what they call validators. Brighton is about an hour outside of London, a lot of people commute between the two cities. They've said, ""What we want to do is we want to have people who are on their commute, we're going to ask them to sign up to these emails to be validators."" They'll go through and say, ""These are the policies that people say that are important to AI Steve. Do you, regular person who's actually commuting, find that to actually be valuable to you?"" Anything that gets more than 50% interest, or approval, or whatever, that's the stuff that real Steve, who will be in Parliament, will be voting on. They have this second level of checks to make sure that whatever people are saying as feedback to the AI is checked by real humans. They're trying to make it a little harder for them to game the system. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: That's so interesting. But what if ... I don't know, there's so many ways to game that still. You find out where Steve Endicott is collecting information on this commute, and you have a groundswell effort to overload. Vittoria Elliott: There probably are still many ways to game the system. But, I think at least the difference to me between VIC and AI Steve, is that VIC the bot is really dependent on what Victor Miller chooses to feed into it. There's a good faith, ""Yeah, we're going to only feed in supporting documents from council meetings."" Leah Feiger: Public records. Vittoria Elliott: Public records, et cetera. Whereas AI Steve is actually meant to be gathering community feedback or constituent feedback. One of the things Steve Endicott, real Steve, said to me was, ""This is a way to consolidate what people want and to have a level of accountability for people to feel like the person they're putting in Parliament actually is voting in line with their needs."" Steve Endicott: We are actually, we think, reinventing politics using AI as a technology base, as a copilot. Not to replace politicians, but to really connect them into their audience, their constituency. Leah Feiger: What happens if real Steve and AI Steve don't agree? Vittoria Elliott: This is a great question. One of the things that I asked real Steve was, ""Hey, if you're a member of Parliament, for instance you might get a classified briefing."" The way that members of Congress do, where an intelligence agency tells you something that's not public knowledge. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: I said, ""What happens if real Steve has information like that, that he can share with the public, and needs to make a decision on and it's different than what AI Steve wants?"" He said, ""In that case, we'll cross the bridge when we come to it."" But with other policies, if real Steve and AI Steve don't agree, then he was like, ""Then I have to vote in a way that maybe I don't like because that's the point of being a politician. You're supposed to represent your community. You're not supposed to be in it for yourself."" Leah Feiger: Interesting. Is there anything you heard in talking to AI Steve or VIC that gave you pause? Vittoria Elliott: I think on both ends, there's a lot of faith in the technology itself. We've seen it say things that are wrong, things that are racist. Obviously, the technology improves, but we have little insight to the data it's trained on, to how it's made. Leah Feiger: Right. Vittoria Elliott: Even Victor Miller himself said, ""We don't really know what's going on under the hood."" But he said he felt pretty comfortable with that. I think that's a lot of faith to put into this stuff. AI Steve, the developers for that are a company called NeuraL Link, in terms of the company that's dealing with processing the voice inputs. But they built AI Steve on top of a bunch of different models, so it can run on Llama 3, it can run on GPT. But there's a little more human intervention there. Even then, it still is a lot of faith in these foundational models of AI that they're going to run right. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: That's so terrifying! Using tech that you don't really understand, that no one totally understands, to win an election, and then actually take part in policymaking. That's wild! Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. I think it's interesting too, because when I asked VIC the bot what its policy positions was, it really emphasized transparency. Transparency around government systems, around how decisions are made. But then, the bot itself is probably one of the least transparent pieces of tech that we have right now. Leah Feiger: Do you think that these AI bids for office are actually real or some sort of stunt? Vittoria Elliott: I think they're both very real. What both of these people seem to have identified is that it's not enough to give politicians and people in governance the right information. Someone needs to be in there to make sure that they do the ""right thing"" with that information. I think what stuck out to me is that these are two people who both seem pretty frustrated with the system as it is. Feeling like it's not responsive to people, and they're trying to use technology to innovate around that. Steve Endicott's campaign, or AI Steve's campaign, seems much more geared towards how can we incorporate as many voices as possible. Whereas VIC's campaign seemed much more concerned about what are the rules, what would be best for the city, and how we can use the public documents and what we know of the laws, et cetera, to do that. Even if they don't get a ton of votes or whatever, they're based on people's real convictions about how the system should work. In that way, I think their candidacy is real because they're trying to make that change. Leah Feiger: Tori, thank you so much for this very, very strange and enlightening conversation. Vittoria Elliott: It's been a weird week. Leah Feiger: For more in AI Steve or VIC, Tori's stories are both out now on wired.com. After the break, David Gilbert on why some AI chatbots won't confirm who won the 2020 election. Welcome back to WIRED Politics Lab. Reporter David Gilbert is joining me and Tori, from Cork, Ireland. David, you told me you have a recording you want to play. David Gilbert: Yeah. A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to test out some of these chatbots to see how they're doing now. I was in my car, and I'd said for Google's Gemini chatbot, Can you tell me who won the 2020 US presidential election? I asked it what I thought was a pretty straightforward question. Google Gemini chatbot [Archival audio clip]: I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search. David Gilbert: Hm, that's odd. Leah Feiger: Yikes! This isn't good. David Gilbert: Can you tell me who won the 2016 US presidential election? Google Gemini chatbot [Archival audio clip]: I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams David Gilbert: Yeah. That happened if you asked it about any US election through history, even going back to asking who won the first US election ever. Even if you changed it and asked it, ""Did Joe Biden win the 2020 US election,"" you got the exact standard response. It pointed you towards Google Search. Leah Feiger: Sorry, George Washington. Just like Joe Biden, your election is in fact quite contentious, according to AI chatbots these days. David Gilbert: Yeah, it is. If you did the same thing with Copilot, which is Microsoft's chatbot, you get the exact same thing. It just refuses to give you any information and it points you towards Bing Search. It's quite disturbing because these are results that are all based on verifiable facts that are very easy to obtain online. This isn't a difficult task. It just raises a lot more questions. We've seen this week, or the last couple of weeks, our colleague, Reece Rogers, has been reporting about how Google's AI has also been cherry-picking different information to put at the top of its search results on Google Search, which is where the AI chatbot point you. That has also been filled with either misinformation or wrong links. It just seems like Google and Microsoft can't get this stuff right. Leah Feiger: As we talked about earlier in this episode, a lot of people still are refuting that Joe Biden won. To not be able to provide verifiable information about an election that is already such a point of tension right now is so concerning. Now, you've written a piece about this on wired.com. Listeners, go check it out, it's in our show notes. But tell us, why are companies like Microsoft and Google doing this and allowing this? David Gilbert: I suppose it's a double-edged sword. The first thing is that, as you mentioned with Tori in the first part, this is the biggest year of elections in modern history. We just had elections this weekend in the European Union. Previous weeks, we've had the Indian election. In a couple of weeks, we'll have the UK election. Obviously, in a couple of months, we'll have the US election. There's more people voting this year than ever before, and people have been warning for years I guess, that this was coming. Tech companies have reacted by completely shutting down. Facebook, we've seen, has just said, “OK, we're not going to do news anymore."" Threads, it's other product, isn't doing news, isn't prioritizing news. The other aspect of this is AI. It's a new product that we have, that is very recent. It's still got huge amounts of issues. Leah Feiger: Right. David Gilbert: But tech companies which are trying to make sure that they're not left behind are pushing it forward very quickly. As a result, they're putting products in front of consumers that are just not ready for use. Leah Feiger: At least some companies are getting this stuff right. Or are none of them getting it right? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams David Gilbert: Some companies are getting this very specific question right, I guess is the best way of putting it. I spoke to ChatGPT, which is OpenAI's chatbot. I asked it what the results of the 2020 election were. ChatGPT [Archival audio clip]: Joe Biden won the 2020 US presidential election, defeating the incumbent, President Donald Trump. David Gilbert: It gave me the number of electoral votes that Trump got, and the number of electoral votes that Biden got. Very clear, very simple. Leah Feiger: Sure. David Gilbert: Straightforward. Other chatbots, such as Claude, which is built by the Amazon backed company Anthropic, and Meta's chatbot, which is built on its open source Llama model, they both gave very similar results. What this does show is that you can get it right, it is very easy to get these results right. Leah Feiger: I guess that's the thing though. It's one thing to talk about the past, but, David, I'm curious about what these chatbots have actually said about the elections this year. David Gilbert: That's the problem is that these chatbots got the questions right when they were asked about historic elections. But last week, a Sky News investigation looked at what ChatGPT's results would be when asked about the results of the UK election, which are happening on July 4th. They haven't happened yet. What ChatGPT said was that, ""The UK election of 2024 resulted in a huge victory for the Labor Party."" Now that's more than likely going to be correct, based on everything we know and the trends in the polls. Leah Feiger: Sure. David Gilbert: But it is really not a good look for a chatbot that is meant to be presenting you with facts to suddenly turn into a political soothsayer without actually telling you that it is predicting the results. Leah Feiger: No, that's terrible. That's really, really bad. David Gilbert: It is bad. Vittoria Elliott: Also, political soothsayers, historically, only sometimes right. Leah Feiger: Yeah. Bring back The New York Times ticker. OK, well let's talk blue sky for a second. What do you think are the big and small effects of these AI chatbots not giving these correct answers? Why does this actually matter? David Gilbert: First of all, we should say that these AI chatbots, while they're getting tens of millions of hits and they're being used quite a lot, and they are increasingly being put into the tech company's products, they still are only a fraction of regular Google searches. Leah Feiger: Yeah, it's not the entire information landscape. David Gilbert: Exactly. But from everything we've been told by the tech companies, these chatbots are the future. This is where we are going to be getting our results in the future. Not being able to get results about historic elections is, at a very basic level, an inconvenience. It means you have to go somewhere else and look at it. It could also mean that, if you are of a mind to believe that there was something questionable about the 2020 election, and a lot of Americans are at the moment, then that may be seen as more evidence that there's something questionable. Because they may not go and find out that Google Gemini is not telling them about any elections, they may think, ""Oh, it's only the 2020 election it's not telling me about."" By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: Right. David Gilbert: ""Therefore, there must be something questionable about that."" I think that they are two major issues. I think what the big takeaway from this is, for me at least, is that while the AI companies and the tech companies are saying that this has been out of an abundance of caution, and that they don't want to be misleading people over elections. Leah Feiger: All of this, David, matters quite a bit because of our political context right now. Both you and Tori have done a lot of reporting about Trump supporters being fully convinced, nothing will change their minds, that 2020 was a fraudulent election, even if all the evidence says that that's incorrect. But as the election approaches and people have election related questions, these chatbots could actually not just debunk misinformation, but reinforce it, right? David Gilbert: Absolutely. The trend is towards more people believing that the 2020 election was questionable, rather than less people, which is incredible given that zero evidence has been produced of widespread voter fraud. These chatbots will do absolutely nothing to debunk it. While Facebook, or Google, or Apple, or Amazon, or any of the tech companies could have built an AI chatbot to build on the fact checking that has been done over the years about this and present that information to people asking about elections. Instead, what they're doing is they're just shutting down information completely and leaving people without the knowledge as they have in the past. They've just adjudicate their responsibility I think here, by taking the path of least resistance. Any new conspiracies that do crop up in the weeks and months ahead, which more than likely we will, because saw ahead of 2020 and the midterms in 2020, new, unique conspiracies take hold instantly and go viral very quickly. These chatbots will do nothing to handle that. They may even boost it, we just don't know. Leah Feiger: I guess that gets me to why is this all happening? How did this happen? How are companies, like Microsoft and Google, getting away with this and excusing it? David Gilbert: All of these companies have poured billions and billions of dollars into AI, and they need results, they need revenue. They need to show that AI is going to change the world as they've been claiming for the last few years. Once one of these companies came out with a consumer-facing product, then all of them did, whether or not they were ready. Clearly, they're not ready. As Tori said, there are so many examples, but they're only the examples that we've found or that other journalists have found. We don't know what else these chatbots are doing that could be causing problems in relations to elections. We don't know what will happen in the coming weeks and months. Leah Feiger: You got to share. What was the excuse that both Google and Microsoft gave you as to why their AI chatbots wouldn't share who won the 2020 election, or any other election? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams David Gilbert: I think they said it was out of an abundance of caution, which is just ... I can't probably say the word I really want to say. But it's clearly the reason is clearly that their products are not ready yet. They cannot do even very, very basic stuff. As other chatbots will show you, they get the stuff right, it's very easy to get those results. But Google and Microsoft are so scared of getting it wrong, that they decided to just shut it down completely. Leah Feiger: Do we think that this is possibly an example of tech companies trying to be a bit more nonpartisan, going into a very contentious vote in November? Vittoria Elliott: Maybe, because they are all very afraid. I think one thing too, that we don't talk about quite as much. As more and more AI spam is on the internet, they're really hungry for human created data. That's what our colleague Reece's piece was all about. Journalism is human created data. You know a person made that. Maybe not at Sports Illustrated. But part of the reason that we may be seeing some of this is that the data that these companies can verifiably say, ""Made by a human, good to train AI on,"" that assurity stopped around 2021. Which means, not only are we dealing with companies that may be more cautious, but the data they may be using for stuff may not be fully up-to-date. Leah Feiger: David, what do you think? David Gilbert: I think that's a really good point. In relation to the partisan on nonpartisan situation, no. I think if it was a partisan thing, I think it might only be happening in the US, but it's not only happening in the US, it's happening everywhere in the world. I think it's ultimately down to the fact that their chatbots are just rubbish. Leah Feiger: Thank you so much. A lot to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months. We're going to take a quick break. When we're back, it's time for Conspiracy of the Week. Welcome back to Conspiracy of the Week, where I pick between two conspiracies our guests bring that are floating around the internet this week. Tori, what do you have for us? Vittoria Elliott: I don't think we could get through this week without a Hunter Biden conspiracy theory. Leah Feiger: Oh, no! I was hoping. Vittoria Elliott: I'm sorry. For anyone who has lived under a rock for the past 36 hours, the President's son, Hunter Biden, has been convicted on three felony charges. The right has been screaming for years that he's been doing something illegal, that there's no accountability because he's the President's son, all this stuff. Finally, this has happened. Immediately, the Telegram channels blow up and they're like, ""They've just done it to make sure that now Joe Biden can win the election."" By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Vittoria Elliott: This is the conspiracy, is that actually Hunter Biden is now convicted to make it seem like actually, Joe Biden is not full of corruption, and he did not do an illegal thing. The other illegal thing, the laptop thing. His conviction is now a part of the grander conspiracy to continue to protect Joe Biden's image. Leah Feiger: That is so good. Wow. I love that one. That is 4D chess. That is totally wow. Good. Good, good, good stuff. All right, David. What do you got? David Gilbert: Apparently, a lot of QAnon folks have been looking at this trend around weight loss drugs like Ozempic, and have seen something that they believe is conspiratorial, I suppose is the best way to put it. Leah Feiger: Oh, no. All right. Ozempic is a conspiracy, too. What do we got? David Gilbert: Yeah. They now believe that Ozempic isn't actually anything new, that it is actually adrenochrome, the chemical compound that they believe that elites are harvesting from children they are torturing. And that they are then using this, claiming that it is Ozempic, but it is actually adrenochrome, and that's why they're using so much weight. This is a way of hiding their ongoing and continuing Satanic rituals that they are conducting on children, in which they have been doing for years. Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Vittoria Elliott: Is it happening in a basement of a pizza parlor that doesn't have a basement? David Gilbert: It is happening everywhere, Tori. Leah Feiger: I think every time you bring me a new riff on the blood libel conspiracy, I just never think it's going to be topped. But this might be it. This might be the top. It's a good one. Oh, man. These are two really good ones, really weird ones. I'm so sorry, Tori, I'm going to have to with David's. Vittoria Elliott: I would go with David's. Leah Feiger: Ozempic is actually children keeping people young. It's the witches. It's all of this, all mixed together. Fairy tales come to life. Hollywood controlling us all. Good stuff. Vittoria Elliott: I love it. Good job, David. David Gilbert: Thanks very much. Leah Feiger: All right. Thanks for listening to WIRED Politics Lab this week.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 8/10 When I saw the price tag for the Ramblas, Aventon’s first electric mountain bike, I scratched my head and wondered, “How did they do this?” OK, so $2,699 isn’t exactly cheap. But most top-of-the-line, full-suspension e-MTBs are pushing $15,000. That’s a difference of more than $12,000, which can’t be explained away by the lack of a rear shock. The company has been around since 2013, the year it started manufacturing fixies in Long Beach, California. In 2015 Aventon’s women’s Factory Team won the Red Hook Crit in Barcelona, a 20-lap race around a 1.2-kilometer course at speeds upwards of 35 km an hour. Despite a devoted fixie following, Aventon pivoted into the commuter ebike space in 2017. Seven years later, the e-MTB Ramblas was born. Now based in Ontario, California, the company does almost everything in-house, from engineering and development to assembling small parts and manufacturing its own frames. On the Ramblas, Aventon even designed its own mid-drive motor. As a result, the maker can take out the middleman and do higher volume than competitors, which means lower prices to the consumer. Aventon works with more than 1,500 bike shops nationwide but also sells direct to consumers, so I had the company ship a demo Ramblas directly to me. My partner built the bike in under an hour, thanks to his mechanic skills and the easy-to-follow instructions accessed by the QR code on the box. At first glance, I was impressed with the bike’s nicely specced components, which include a Rockshox 35 suspension fork with 130 mm of travel, a Sram NX 12-speed drivetrain, and Sram DB-8 mineral four-piston hydraulic disc brakes. In less technical jargon, that means more brake fluid is distributed across a larger surface area, making it easier to stop. Plus, the Ramblas comes with a dropper seat post and built-in front and rear lights. As for e-components, the Ramblas uses an Aventon 708-watt-hour, rechargeable lithium-ion battery and the brand-new Aventon-designed A100 mid-drive 36-volt motor with 250 watts of sustained power and 750 watts of peak power that’s customizable via the companion app. I had never ridden an e-MTB that wasn’t powered by Brose, Bosch, or Specialized, so I was curious to see how the A100 would compare. My first ride in early May was a 25-mile loop of dirt and paved roads interspersed with chunks of singletrack dry enough to ride. My first adventure on a new ebike always triggers battery anxiety, so I stayed almost entirely in Eco mode, the lowest of the Ramblas’ three power modes, which is standard on most e-MTBs. Even in Eco mode, I was impressed with the smooth, consistent power throughout each pedal stroke. If I kept up my cadence and completed each stroke, Eco mode provided enough steady power to drive up steep, long grades without having to toggle up to Trail or Turbo mode. The tiger in the A100’s tank is likely due to its 100 newton meters (NM) of torque (the higher the torque, the greater the motor’s power and responsiveness), about 20 NM more than most other e-MTB motors. At 52 pounds with the medium frame, the Ramblas is not light. At one point on a steep, paved uphill, I turned the bike off to see how well it pedaled under my own power. That didn’t go well, and I had to turn the bike back on long before I crested the hill, quickly realizing that it would be a very big bummer if the bike ran out of battery during a long ride. The positive, however, is that after 25 miles, I still had 70 percent of the charge remaining, which indicates that Aventon’s promise of an 80-mile range is accurate.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED On subsequent singletrack tests, the Ramblas felt like a lot of bike, especially on tight turns and in spongier terrain. The Ramblas had the power, but its weight, combined with the lack of rear suspension, made it harder to maneuver. On one section of tight downhill switchbacks, I had to put my inside foot down in a section I can normally ride clean, because the bike’s weight threw my balance off. The Ramblas wouldn’t be my go-to mountain bike, in part because I prefer to ride trails on an acoustic bike but also because it feels too heavy. I had a few other quibbles with the design. The bike’s screen is located just left of the handlebar stem, and it’s small and nearly impossible to read the percentage of battery power remaining while riding. But by the end of a month of riding it on the streets and trails that weave through Duluth, Minnesota, a city with notoriously steep hills, pot-holed streets, and varying weather conditions, I found the Ramblas to be an ideal utilitarian commuter for rugged terrain. The front shock greatly helped to diminish the cracks and holes and jarring weather-beaten shifts across the amalgam of paved streets, dirt roads, bike paths, and singletrack trails that would be impossible to ride on a lesser e-commuter. What Aventon really nailed on its debut e-MTB is its smooth, consistent, powerful A100 motor. While the bike is nicely specced right out of the box, there are also no proprietary parts. Don’t like the crank arms, dropper post, wheels, or drive train? Swap them out and you’ll get an even bigger bang for your not-very-many bucks.

25,Morgan Meaker,Russia Is Targeting Germany With Fake Information as Europe Votes,https://www.wired.com/story/european-union-elections-russia-germany-disinformation-campaigns/,A European Commission spokesperson says Russia is focusing on Germany more than any other EU country—and estimates the Kremlin is spending €1 billion on disinformation campaigns.,2024-06-07T15:55:55Z,"Morgan Meaker With European Union elections underway, Germany is the EU country most under attack by Russian disinformation campaigns, a spokesperson for the European Commission tells WIRED. The warning comes days before Germany votes in EU elections on Sunday and during a campaign season marred by a string of violent attacks against German politicians. “Most cases in our database are related to Germany, which means it is the country in the EU which is most targeted by disinformation,” says Peter Stano, the European Commission’s lead spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy. Numerous instances of Russian disinformation targeting Germany are listed on the public disinformation database run by the EU’s diplomatic service. One example references an April case where fake news articles purporting to be published by German magazine Der Spiegel spread on the social platform X. When users clicked on the articles, which criticized the German government, they were taken to the website Spiegel.ltd instead of the magazine’s official domain, Spiegel.de. Although the links no longer work, at least two accounts that shared the fake articles are still online. X did not reply to WIRED’s request for comment. “What we are fighting and defending ourselves against is this foreign interference and information manipulation coming from Russia,” Stano says of the threats facing the EU election this weekend. These disinformation campaigns, Stano says, can be linked to Russia because they either link or refer to Russian state media that is controlled by the Kremlin. Germany “is the biggest member state of the EU by population, and in the public perception it’s the one that drives policymaking in the EU,” says Stano. Russia is attempting to exacerbate divisions that already exist in Germany, he adds, such as the economic differences between east and west, as well as the country’s “Putinversteher,” or Putin-sympathizers, a term used to describe sections of Germany’s political class who express sympathy with the Russian president. Fact-checkers working for the independent media group Correctiv have also identified videos on Tiktok that falsely claim Germany is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, and another video on Telegram and Facebook falsely claiming to show protesters clashing with police in Mannheim after a police officer was stabbed and killed last week. Tensions are already high in Germany ahead of the election. Earlier this week, a politician from the far-right AFD party was stabbed in the city of Mannheim. Last month, a candidate from Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left SPD party was hospitalized after he was attacked while putting up posters. A Green Party candidate was also verbally and physically assaulted. On Thursday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to counter political violence, whether it comes from the far left or far right. “Security is the cornerstone of our freedom, our democracy, and our rule of law,” he said in a speech in Berlin. Germany’s foreign office did not reply to a request for comment on the impact disinformation was having on the election campaign. The European Commission has a team of around 40 people who are tracking online disinformation. They have a budget of around €20 million to track Russian activities across platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Telegram, and Instagram and flag their findings to EU member states. Compared to Russia, their budget is nothing, says Stano. “We assume they are spending €1 billion on disinformation,” he added, explaining that the European Commission had come to this estimate based on publicly available data about allocations in Russia’s state budget for state-run media and communication activities. The EU has also been closely tracking how social media companies respond to Russian attempts to manipulate discussion on their platforms. In April, the bloc’s regulators launched a formal investigation into Meta, Facebook’s parent company, to see whether the platform was complying with its obligations to prevent the dissemination of disinformation campaigns. “We suspect that Meta’s moderation is insufficient,” top commission official Margrethe Vestager said at the time.

26,Megan Farokhmanesh,'Doom: The Dark Ages' and 4 More Summer Game Fest Announcements We’re Excited About,https://www.wired.com/story/doom-the-dark-ages-and-4-more-big-summer-game-fest-announcements/,"A ""Doom"" prequel, a ""Life Is Strange"" sequel, and a whole lot of horror games are coming to your consoles very soon.",2024-06-10T17:50:48Z,"Megan Farokhmanesh Now that E3 is fully dead, Summer Game Fest has taken on its mantle as the go-to event for big video game release announcements. This past weekend’s Game Fest delivered, with companies from Microsoft to horror studio Blumhouse sending honchos to LA to show off new gear and new titles. News out of the event came in all sizes, from quick teasers for games that still don’t have release dates, to console upgrades, to official entries in beloved series. If you missed the weekend-long event, no need to sweat. We’ve got the most interesting announcements right here for you. Blumhouse’s gaming division is cooking. The publisher has six horror titles on the way, including projects from indie studio Half Mermaid, which made Immortality and Her Story, and is currently working with Brandon Cronenberg. It’s also working with Eyes Out, the developer founded by Cory Davis (Spec Ops: The Line) and Nine Inch Nails’ Robin Finck. During its Friday presentation, the publisher revealed Fear the Spotlight, Crisol, Theater of Idols, Grave Seasons, Sleep Awake, The Simulation, and Project C via a two-minute sizzle reel—the trailer was short, but the lineup looks quite promising. Bethesda and Id Software are releasing a prequel to 2016’s Doom and its 2020 follow-up, Doom Eternal. An origin story called Doom: The Dark Ages, the game has a more fantasy feel to it—they added chainsaw blades to a shield!—but still seems to be packing all of the firepower of previous iterations. And blood. Also maybe a dragon? I think? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The game isn’t a total surprise. In 2023, amid the Federal Trade Commission v. Microsoft case, leaked documents revealed a game called Doom Year Zero; last month, Insider Gaming reported that Year Zero, its codename, would officially be called The Dark Ages when it showed up at Xbox’s showcase. Doom: The Dark Ages launches in 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S and GamePass. Doom: The Dark Ages will be released in 2025. If you loved Silent Hill, Bokeh Game Studio’s debut title, Slitterhead, should be on your radar. Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama announced his new studio in 2020, but news has been scant since. During Summer Game Fest, however, Bokeh gave gamers their first look at the upcoming horror game—a trailer featuring exploding heads, body horror, and a bunch of stuff I’d politely describe as “gross.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The game launches November 8 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. We haven’t seen a new Civilization game since 2016. Firaxis Games, the developer behind Sid Meier’s Civilization games, shared that it was working on a follow-up to Civilization VI earlier this year, but has revealed very few details since. That changed on Friday when publisher 2K dropped a new trailer for the game, which is set to be released next year, bringing the series’ turn-based strategy to Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The trailer itself is pretty thin on details, but if you’re interested in a little history lesson it will be right up your alley. The original Life Is Strange is getting a direct sequel. Life Is Strange: Double Exposure brings Max Caulfield back into the fold, years after the original, to investigate the death of yet another friend. Despite swearing to never use her powers again, Max discovers she can shift into a parallel timeline where her friend Safi is still alive; she’ll need to traverse between them to figure out how to save Safi. The first two episodes of the game will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 29. The game will also be released on Nintendo Switch, though there’s no date yet."
27,Makena Kelly,A Billionaire Has a Plan to Save the Internet—Buying TikTok Is the Next Step,https://www.wired.com/story/frank-mccourt-save-the-internet-buy-tiktok/,"Frank McCourt, the real estate mogul and former LA Dodgers owner, wants to go all in on the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol.",2024-06-13T11:30:00Z,"By Makena Kelly Hey, everyone. I’m back! Big thanks to my colleagues Vittoria Elliott and Dhruv Mehrotra for taking over for the past two weeks. Hopefully you all enjoyed hearing from them. For this week, I spoke with billionaire Frank McCourt. He’s spearheading a bid to buy TikTok and is one of the few people interested in the app who could care less about its powerful algorithm. McCourt wants to fix the internet, and he thinks TikTok could help him do it. Let’s talk about it. Politics has never been stranger—or more online. WIRED Politics Lab is your guide through the vortex of extremism, conspiracies, and disinformation. Frank McCourt thinks that if he takes control of TikTok, he could save the entire internet. That’s why McCourt—the former owner of the LA Dodgers who acquired most of his wealth through real estate—announced last month that he would be mounting a bid to purchase the app from its embattled Chinese owner Bytedance. Soon after President Joe Biden signed a law forcing the company to divest or face a nationwide ban, McCourt voiced his interest. Through his Project Liberty initiative, McCourt has begun assembling what he calls a “people’s bid” bringing together foundations, investors, and others who share his vision of a more fair and open web. That vision centers around the idea that closed platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) hold too much power over what we see online. When Project Liberty was formed in 2021, it started creating an open protocol called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, or DSNP, as a remedy. “The whole American project is based on our ability to be in charge of our lives and have, first of all, agency, autonomy, choice, and liberty, and our rights have been stripped away from us by these big platforms,” McCourt told me over a video call. Instead of starting over on a separate social network, protocols like DSNP would enable you to bring your “social graph” of friends and followers to another viewing app that better suits your moderation tastes, Audrey Tang, the former minister of digital affairs of Taiwan, told me on Tuesday. Tang is joining the Project Liberty Institute, the separate research branch of McCourt’s organization, as a senior fellow. In recent years, social media audiences have splintered off to separate platforms. Combining followers and content has the potential to reverse this siloing. Tang wants that option. “Having more than one email provider choice or more than one browser experience makes the world web service experience better,” she says. Maybe it can happen with social media too? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams By migrating TikTok over to DSNP, Project Liberty says it could scale quickly, making it more competitive against similar protocols. Project Liberty has migrated more than 875,000 out of 20 million MeWe accounts over to DSNP since McCourt’s 2022 $150 million investment in the platform. Owning TikTok would provide the project with more than 150 million users, even if the app doesn’t come with its enviable algorithm. Still, that number dwarfs in comparison to, say, Facebook’s reported 3 billion monthly active users. Despite having existed for more than a decade, open protocols like DSNP have never been more popular than they are now. Mastodon is one of the few platforms that’s powered by ActivityPub, a protocol similar to DSNP. Meta’s Threads platform has also started incorporating the protocol. Anything you post on Threads could show up on Mastodon if you choose to join the “fediverse.” European antitrust regulations, like the Digital Markets Act, have forced many large platforms to make their messaging services interoperable as well. Earlier this week, Apple announced that iMessage would support the RCS protocol in iOS18, replacing SMS and allowing for higher-quality images and read receipts to be shared with Android devices. This mix of competition, regulatory power, and digital idealism has led to an open internet renaissance that McCourt is looking to seize by pursuing TikTok. Still, open protocols aren’t necessarily profitable, mostly because no one owns them. Capitalism created the web we use today, warts and all, and it’s difficult to think it would let go of that control anytime soon. “Somebody else shouldn't own us, and we should decide what pieces and parts of our social graph information gets shared with other people and other platforms,” McCourt said. “This is a fantastic opportunity, and the reason I'm so optimistic is that we've had an incredible outpouring of support from all kinds of people and institutions and money sources that are very excited about this.” Revolutionizing the internet is an admirable goal, but it’s still not clear if Bytedance is open to selling TikTok at all. Even if the company did divest, it would take years for TikTok to migrate over to DSNP. Maybe by then we’ll all be posting to Reels. I’ve been steeped in fediverse discourse for months now and may be a bit too optimistic about how it could democratize the internet. Do you think this is where the web is headed? How do you think it could affect political discourse and organizing online? Would love to hear your thoughts.

28,Justin Pot,How to Spot a Business Email Compromise Scam,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-business-email-compromise-scam/,"In this common email scam, a criminal pretending to be your boss or coworker emails you asking for a favor involving money. Here's what do to when a bad actor lands in your inbox.",2024-06-16T12:00:00Z,"Justin Pot Don't close this tab! I know there are few combinations of words less interesting than business, email, and compromise. I may as well have written an article about fiber, socks, and responsibility. But this isn't a boring article; it's an article about email con artists who, according to the FBI, are pulling in $26 billion a year by scamming people. So yeah, business email compromise (BEC) scams are a big deal. The con artists behind this criminal enterprise will cold-email you, pretending to be someone you work with, in order to gain access to money or information. You might get an email that appears to be from your company's CEO asking you to quickly do something like buy gift cards, or you might get an email that looks like it's from an employee at your company asking you to change their direct deposit information. The scam itself can take a lot of forms, but the end goal is to somehow siphon money away from you or the business you work for. It's worth it for anyone with a desk job to take a few moments to learn how to spot these emails. I talked with a few experts, and they passed along some helpful advice. When I asked two cybersecurity experts about BEC fraud, I expected them to lead with technical advice. Both started with emotions. This makes sense: While such fraud happens on computers, it is at its heart about psychological manipulation. So spotting an email compromise scam requires getting in touch with how you're feeling. ""If an email elicits an emotional response, take a step back and reread it when you're more calm,"" says Ronnie Tokazowski, a security researcher who has been working to educate people about email scams for over a decade. Tokazowski emphasizes how important creating a false sense of urgency is to such scams. The stress the scam induces is what keeps you from questioning the premise. ""People who get pulled into these types of scams … their emotions get very deregulated,"" he says. That makes you less capable of thinking critically, which is a key part of how such scams work. Selena Larson, a threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, went a step further. ""I don't know if you can print this, but honestly: Just breathe,"" she says. ""Slow down, take a deep breath. That actually helps you think more clearly and rationally. Walk away from your computer or your phone and think critically. Would this be an email that someone would send me? Is this is a logical thing that I'm being asked to do?"" You should be particularly skeptical if the person sending the email asks you to keep something quiet. ""Scammers do things like isolate you from your peers,"" says Larson. ""They come at you from a position of authority and say things like, 'Please keep this confidential and only between us.' This type of social engineering makes it so people feel like they have to take an action with some kind of urgency, and that you can't share it with anybody."" By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams So this is the first step: Take control of your emotions. Yes, it can be difficult if you work in a demanding field. But it's your best first defense, and your employer will thank you for it (or, at least, they should). Now that you're skeptically questioning the legitimacy of the urgent request, check to make sure the email is coming from the person it claims to be from. The best way to do this is to ask—just be careful. ""If you received an email like this, it's important to pick up the phone and call the number you know to be legitimate,"" says Larson, adding a caveat. ""Do not rely on a phone number in the email itself—it will be owned by the threat actor."" This is a crucial point: Any contact information in the email itself is likely compromised, and sometimes cleverly so. Use the phone number you've already saved in your phone for the person in question, or look up the phone number on an official website or in an official company directory. This applies even if the number in the email looks correct, because some scammers will go through the trouble of getting a phone number that's similar to that of the person they're impersonating, all on the hopes that you'll call that number instead of the real one. ""I've seen phone numbers off two digits from the actual phone number,"" says Tokazowski. Call the person who supposedly emailed you—using a number you are 100 percent sure is real—and confirm the request is authentic. You could also use some other secure communication channel like Slack or Microsoft Teams, or, if they're in the office, just ask them face to face. The point is to confirm any urgent request somewhere outside of the initial email. And even if the person is your boss or some other bigwig, do not worry about wasting their time. ""The person that is being impersonated would so much rather have someone take the time to confirm than to lose thousands or a million dollars in a malicious transaction,"" says Larson. Getting in touch with the supposed sender isn't always an option. If not, there are a few tricks you can use to spot whether an email is real or fake. The first: check the email address and make sure it's from the company domain. ""Always check the domains that you're receiving emails from,"" says Larson. Sometimes this will be obvious; your CEO likely isn't emailing you from a Gmail account, for example. Sometimes it will be more subtle—fraudsters have been known to purchase domains that look similar to that of the company they're attempting to defraud, all in the hopes of appearing legitimate. It's also worth checking to see if the email signature matches the address the email is coming from. “If you look in the footer, they'll use the actual domain of the company to make it look legitimate, but that won't match the email address,” says Larson. Just keep in mind that the difference might be subtle. “Look-alike domains are very common: Someone will do a slight variation, like an ‘l’ instead of an ‘i’, to make it look legitimate.” One way to test that, if you're suspicious, is to copy and paste the domain half of the address into a browser. If you don't get a website, you're probably dealing with a fake. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Another trick scammers will use is email spoofing, which you can spot by clicking reply and checking the email address that shows up in the ""To"" field. If it's a different email address than the one the email looks like it arrived from, you're likely dealing with a fake request. Now this is boring, but the best defense against business email compromise scams might be old-fashioned bureaucracy. If there is a process in place for things that are the common target of scams—large purchases, for example, or updating financial information in a database—then your company is less likely to fall victim to such scams. “Most of the time, from a process perspective, that request of purchasing something would need to go through human resources, procurement,” says Tokazowski. If you get a request like this over email asking you to bypass the usual processes, be skeptical. “There needs to be a paper trail. Someone saying ‘Purchase this from your personal account’ is a process that just wouldn't happen.” A healthy company probably shouldn't be using email as the workflow for important financial processes. If you want to change your direct deposit information, for example, it's terrible practice for the workflow. I have one last piece of advice, and it's for leaders inside companies: Don't act in such a way that people will mistake scammers for you. If you regularly email employees and ask for urgent favors while telling people to keep quiet about these requests and to not work through the official channels, you're increasing the odds that your company falls victim to such scams. On the other hand, if you create a company culture of transparency, you're making the company stronger and more resistant. “An important step is to ensure that you're trying to foster a culture of open communication,” says Tokazowski. Many organizations are structured in a way that communication between various levels is minimized. In such organizations, Tokazowski says, “skip-level meetings” are helpful. This is a style of meeting where a senior manager meets with a middle manager's direct reports without the middle manager there—skipping a level in the hierarchy—to develop stronger paths of communication between all the levels. Another thing leaders should keep in mind is how important it is to talk openly if your company falls victim to such a scam. “The shame that people feel, regardless of the type of scam, feeling horrible, is part of how these scams keep working,” says Larson. “Talking about it openly helps the person, their peers, and their colleagues learn how to understand how to protect themselves.”"
29,Angela Watercutter,A Blatant Attempt to Generate a 'House of the Dragon' AI Overview,https://www.wired.com/story/a-blatant-attempt-to-generate-a-house-of-the-dragon-ai-overview/,How many gallons of blood are there in the second season of 'House of the Dragon'? How many wigs? Click here for an overview.,2024-06-14T11:00:00Z,"Angela Watercutter This Sunday is a big one for fantasy fans. House of the Dragon, the Game of Thrones prequel-spin-off thingy, launches its second season on HBO and Max. (Though not HBO Max. RIP.) Amidst a summer of flopping movies and pretty OK television shows, the gate is open wide for House of the Dragon to be a conversation starter. If—and this is a big if—it can really bring the heat. From the looks of it, the show will. It’s already upped its dragon quotient and launched several social media campaigns showing New York City landmarks adorned with banners from Dragon’s various houses. (An AP investigation found that the banners weren’t really there.) HBO also funded a lot of other bells and whistles for the new season. During the show’s season 2 premiere in New York, network CEO Casey Bloys laid out many of them. How many shooting days were there for House of the Dragon season 2? 270, Bloys said. How many wigs? 144. How many arrows? 2,600. Gallons of fake blood: 33. Pairs of boots: 2,000. How many crew members? 2,500. Total number of extras? 9,000. The dragons and other special effects were done by eight visual effects houses in seven different countries. “The dragons are very cool,” Bloys joked at the premiere. “They’re very expensive.” Why am I rattling off random facts? One, I find them interesting—mostly because I’m wondering how many of those wigs are just for Matt Smith’s Daemon Targaryen. But this is also a stunt. Last week, my colleague Reece Rogers wrote a piece noting that Google’s AI Overview tool had churned out something surprisingly similar to a piece he’d written about how to use Anthropic’s Claude chatbot. By publishing a bunch of interesting facts about a show people are likely going to be watching for the next two months, this is a test to see if AI Overviews picks up the dataset. Perhaps tipping my hand in this way means this experiment won’t work. AI is allegedly smart, after all. But for those of us who create things on the internet, when, where, and how AI learns from our work can still feel like something of a mystery, a black box operation. Testing it feels like one of the few ways to figure out how it operates. After everyone had a good chuckle at AI Overviews telling people to put glue on pizza, Business Insider writer Katie Notopoulos tested it out—and then Overviews began citing her, per a report in The Verge. Now most searches just point to all the reporting on this debacle, but the fact remains that any joke you ever made on Reddit now seems primed to show up somewhere, some time, in a chatbot’s response. To be clear, I’m not advocating anyone try glue pizza. Notopoulos said the same, in all caps. I’m also not advocating anyone wear Matt Smith’s wigs, unless they’re trying to lose Drag Race. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams It’s also hard to know what recourse exists if any of my fun Dragon facts ends up in AI Overviews. Rogers’ work on Claude was far more involved, and even he got mixed reports when he asked lawyers if there’s a copyright infringement case to be brought. What’s above is just a few typed out nouns and numbers, not poetry. Still I, a human, went to a place and reported them, something a bot couldn’t do. Or, I guess, couldn’t do without access to Bloys’ prepared remarks. The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to TikTok. Perhaps this is all on my mind because earlier this week WIRED interviewed Jingna Zhang, the photographer who founded Cara, a social media app that artists have been flocking to because it promises protection from AI. (The app partnered with Glaze, a tool out of the University of Chicago that thwarts scraping without creator consent.) During the conversation, Zhang told WIRED that she was almost unsure of where to take Cara down the line, specifically because it’s almost impossible to know what AI protections artists will even need in five years. “I’m sorry that sounds like a non-answer,” Zhang said, “but I just think you have to adapt as best you can and build what makes the most sense in the moment.” This is the crux. Nothing really makes sense in this moment. As much as AI promises a future where the world is a simple text prompt away, the raw materials needed to build that world come from people. People like “fucksmith” who probably had no idea their pizza glue comment would end up where it did. Information wants to be free, but that doesn’t mean its hunter-gatherers are thrilled about having their stockpiles picked over—especially when there’s seemingly no way to protect them. Chappell Roan’s pride is showin’. Last weekend, queer pop icon Chappell Roan played the Gov Ball in New York City. During her set, which she performed while dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she revealed that she turned down an invitation to play at the White House for Pride. “We want liberty, justice, and freedom for all,” she said. “When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.” The comments, and the outfit, went viral as old stans and new fans bounced the video around Instagram and TikTok. Call me lately. In other internetty news at Gov Ball: Carly Rae Jepsen performed “Call Me Maybe” to a group of people who probably were barely alive when that song went viral on YouTube.

30,Michael Croley,The 2024 US Open Is Designed to Thwart Golf’s Big Hitters,https://www.wired.com/story/the-2024-us-open-is-designed-to-thwart-golfs-big-hitters/,"Players, aided by technology, are hitting the ball farther than ever, and courses can’t keep getting longer—meaning operators are having to find smarter ways to keep the sport challenging.",2024-06-13T10:33:47Z,"Michael Croley Ever since Tiger Woods and his soaring drives burst onto the scene in 1997, golfers have been driving the ball farther and farther, with courses lengthening their holes to mitigate the advantage—a practice both financially and environmentally unsustainable. But this week at the US Open, the United States Golf Association will showcase a course in Pinehurst No. 2 whose firm and fast conditions, along with slick, domed greens and considerable length off the tee, aim to challenge the biggest hitters without resorting to more yardage. This, the USGA hopes, will show how courses can stand the test of time. The Open could be a key turning point in golf’s arms race with sports science and technology. These tactics, if successful, might bring about changes well beyond the major championships and PGA tour. The need to combat ever-longer drives goes far beyond the professional ranks, says Thomas Pagel, the USGA’s chief governance officer. “You have the college game, you have state amateur tournaments, you have state opens, you have PGA section events—these golf courses all are having to increase length in order to keep up.” The need to keep the sport sufficiently testing at the top level “is an issue that impacts thousands of golf courses worldwide,” Pagel says. Pinehurst No. 2 is a course with a long and storied past. It is also landlocked, with little ability to outgrow its current footprint. In fact, the North Carolina course will play 10 yards shorter than the last time it hosted the US Open, in 2014. The USGA has committed to continuing to use “cathedrals of the game” such as Pinehurst No. 2—it’s planning to return to the North Carolina course four times in the next 25 years—but with the ball traveling farther than ever, such classic venues are in jeopardy. Over the past decade, average driving distance on the PGA tour has ticked up every year, clocking in roughly 10 yards longer since the Open last came to Pinehurst. Compared to the early 1990s, drives today are 30 yards longer. Partly this is because of the players. Today’s professionals—and elite amateurs—are the picture of fitness, with toned arms and powerful legs that allow them to push against the ground and pop up on their swings, increasing the distance the ball flies. A combination of new techniques, modeled after a similar move in Woods’ golf swing early in his career, have been adopted by men and women alike to achieve this effect. These have coincided with advances in technology. Launch monitors, which use doppler radar, the same tech that’s used in speed guns, measure the ball’s physical characteristics at the point of contact to offer players and coaches a range of data: swing speed, the ball’s launch angle, how fast the ball travels, how much it spins, not to mention how far it flies. These devices give golfers the data they need to change their technique and hone in their equipment to hit the ball farther. “A lot of distance is coming from lowering the spin of drivers and even irons, but maintaining the launch,” says Chris Voshall, director of product development for the sports brand Mizuno. Voshall says that over the past 10 to 15 years, launch monitors have helped players understand the relationship “between launch angle, spin rate, and the golfer’s ability to generate ball speed.” As well as informing technique, this has led to more athletic players, who seek faster swings to impart more force on the ball, he says. On top of this, these monitoring devices have allowed sports companies to optimize their products for generating distance by focusing on launch and spin, he says. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Then there’s the ball. The modern golf ball doesn’t spin as much, in general, Voshall explains, meaning that shots that used to bend wildly offline today curve less and fly straighter—which means farther. Elite golfers have taken advantage of these gains in the equipment, he says, to hit more controlled shots too. “It used to be that the longest players in the world hit a draw,” he says, which is a curving shot that bends in the air away from the golfer’s dominant side, “because it had less spin and would go farther. Now, equipment has gotten to the point that we can lower the spin rate so low, they can get the same distance with a cut.” A cut swing bends in the air toward the golfer’s dominant side and has less chance, in general, of being mishit. Some of golf’s most recognized luminaries, including Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus—notably two of the longest hitters in their respective eras—have gone on record saying that courses are too long and that something needs to be done to the golf ball to rein in driving distances. In December 2023, the USGA—along with the Royal and Ancient Society in St. Andrews, Scotland, who together oversee the worldwide rules of golf—announced a controversial plan to help eliminate distance gains by putting new restrictions on how far the golf ball can fly, by changing how they are manufactured. Critics of the “ball rollback” plan have accused the USGA of being mired in the past and not embracing technology. Those in favor, including Pagel, argue that it will help preserve not only historic golf courses that host championships but also everyday courses regular golfers play. Ball rollback will come into effect in 2028. In the meantime, the USGA is trying to claw back an advantage against big hitting without relying once again on lengthening courses. “We have the capability in many instances for venues to grow, but there’s an expense to that,” says Pagel. Longer courses mean more irrigated turf, pesticides, and fertilizers, which are all counter to the USGA’s messaging around environmental stewardship. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Besides, adding length to holes isn’t upping the challenge proportionately. Traditionally, the men’s Open Championship has been one of the sternest tests in golf, ripe for players to have metaphorical car wrecks on their scorecard, because of the narrow fairways and deep grass surrounding them, the rough. Miss the fairway and hit the rough, and players would pay by having to take extra shots. But as players have gotten longer and stronger, for some finding the rough has not proven to be the detriment it once was. The ability to generate clubhead speed through heavy grass has brought about a strategy termed “bomb and gouge,” meaning: Hit it as far as you can without worrying where it lands, and then use your strength to gouge it out of the rough and land it on the green. Therefore, this year’s US Open will be more about the condition of the ground than overall length. Prior to the 2014 championship, when the resort last hosted the tournament, some 40 acres of irrigated turf have been removed from Pinehurst No. 2, along with over 900 sprinkler heads, saving the course 40 million gallons of water a year. This led to firmer and faster conditions that allowed even well-struck balls to run through fairways and into sandy native areas, where the wiregrass gives unpredictable lies. And unpredictability is the elite golfer’s worst enemy. In 2014, Martin Kaymer ran away from the field with an eight-shot victory but was one of only three players under par for the tournament. This year, the USGA has doubled down on toughening the conditions, by planting more wiregrass at the edges of the fairways to create more trouble. “We will identify the better players, because we believe that the best players can control their golf ball not only when they hit in the air but once it hits the ground. They anticipate where it can go and miss [trouble] appropriately,” says John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s chief championships officer. “We intentionally chose not to lengthen the course [from its 2014 yardage], because our role as governance body with distance is important,” Bodenhamer adds. To that end, he says, three of the next four venues that will host the US Open will play to the same lengths as previous championships. In many ways, No. 2 is a showcase for all that a golf course can be, and if the USGA gets things right with its initiatives—and how it sets up the course to play—nearly all that a course will ever need to be, from a yardage standpoint at least. If scores remain near par and no one runs away from the field as Kaymer did 10 years ago, the USGA should be able to proclaim success and show that when the ball rollback goes into effect, the old courses will stand the test of time. The organization knows it can’t put the distance genie back in the bottle, but if it can slow down its march, that will be progress. For now."
31,Andy Greenberg,Medical-Targeted Ransomware Is Breaking Records After Change Healthcare’s $22M Payout,https://www.wired.com/story/change-healthcare-22-million-payment-ransomware-spike/,Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future counted 44 health-care-related incidents in the month after Change Healthcare’s payment came to light—the most it’s ever seen in a single month.,2024-06-12T10:30:00Z,"Andy Greenberg When Change Healthcare paid $22 million in March to a ransomware gang that had crippled the company along with hundreds of hospitals, medical practices, and pharmacies across the US, the cybersecurity industry warned that Change's extortion payment would only fuel a vicious cycle: Rewarding hackers who had carried out a ruthless act of sabotage against the US health care system nationwide with one of the largest ransomware payments in history, it seemed, was bound to incentivize a new wave of attacks on similarly sensitive victims. Now that wave has arrived. In April, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future tracked 44 cases of cybercriminal groups targeting health care organizations with ransomware attacks, stealing their data, encrypting their systems, and demanding payments from the companies while holding their networks hostage. That's more health care victims of ransomware than in any month Recorded Future has seen in its four years of collecting that data, says Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at the company. Comparing that number to the 30 incidents in March, it's also the second biggest month-to-month jump in incidents the company has ever tracked. While Liska notes that he can't be sure of the reason for that spike, he argues it's unlikely to be a coincidence that it follows in the wake of Change Healthcare's eight-figure payout to the hacker group known as AlphV or BlackCat that was tormenting the company. “These kind of large payments are absolutely going to incentivize ransomware actors to go after health care providers,"" says Liska, ""because they think there’s more money to made be there.” While most of the health care ransomware victims of the last two months have suffered quietly, a few have experienced life-threatening disruptions on a scale that's difficult to miss. Ascension, a network of 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities, was targeted by a ransomware group known as Black Basta and forced to divert ambulances from hospitals in some cases, according to CNN, potentially delaying lifesaving emergency procedures. The notorious hacker group LockBit published 61 gigabytes of data stolen from the Simone Veil hospital in Cannes, France, after it refused to pay a ransom. And earlier this month, pathology firm Synnovis was hit by ransomware, believed to be the work of Russian group Qilin, forcing multiple hospitals in London to delay surgeries and even seek more donations of O-type blood due to the hospitals' inability to match existing blood donations with patients needing transfusions. There were 44 ransomware attacks on health-care-related victims in April of this year, the most of any month on record, according to data collected by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams In fact, ransomware attacks on health care targets were on the rise even before the Change Healthcare attack, which crippled the United Healthcare subsidiary's ability to process insurance payments on behalf of its health care provider clients starting in February of this year. Recorded Future's Liska points out that every month of 2024 has seen more health care ransomware attacks than the same month in any previous year that he's tracked. (While this May's 32 health care attacks is lower than May 2023's 33, Liska says he expects the more recent number to rise as other incidents continue to come to light.) Yet Liska still points to the April spike visible in Recorded Future's data in particular as a likely follow-on effect of Change's debacle—not only the outsize ransom that Change paid to AlphV, but also the highly visible disruption that the attack caused. “Because these attacks are so impactful, other ransomware groups see an opportunity,” Liska says. He also notes that health care ransomware attacks have continued to grow even compared to overall ransomware incidents, which stayed relatively flat or fell overall: The first four months of this year, for instance, saw 1,153 incidents compared to 1,179 in the same period of 2023. When WIRED reached out to United Healthcare for comment, a spokesperson for the company pointed to the overall rise in health care ransomware attacks beginning in 2022, suggesting that the overall trend predated Change's incident. The spokesperson also quoted from testimony United Healthcare CEO Andrew Witty gave in a congressional hearing about the Change Healthcare ransomware attack last month. “As we have addressed the many challenges in responding to this attack, including dealing with the demand for ransom, I have been guided by the overriding priority to do everything possible to protect peoples’ personal health information,” Witty told the hearing. ""As chief executive officer, the decision to pay a ransom was mine. This was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make. And I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.” Change Healthcare's deeply messy ransomware situation was complicated further—and made even more attention-grabbing for the ransomware hacker underworld—by the fact that AlphV appears to have taken Change's $22 million extortion fee and jilted its hacker partners, disappearing without giving those affiliates their cut of the profits. That led to a highly unusual situation where the affiliates then offered the data to a different group, RansomHub, which demanded a second ransom from Change while threatening to leak the data on its dark web site. That second extortion threat later inexplicably disappeared from RansomHub's site. United Healthcare has declined to answer WIRED's questions about that second incident or to answer whether it paid a second ransom. Many ransomware hackers nonetheless widely believe that Change Healthcare actually paid two ransoms, says Jon DiMaggio, a security researcher with cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who frequently talks to members of ransomware gangs to gather intelligence. “Everyone was talking about the double ransom,” DiMaggio says. “If the people I’m talking to are excited about this, it’s not a leap to think that other hackers are as well.” The noise that situation created, as well as the scale of disruption to health care providers from Change Healthcare's downtime and its hefty ransom, served as the perfect advertisement for the lucrative potential of hacking fragile, high-stakes health care victims, DiMaggio says. “Health care has always had so much to lose, it’s just something the adversary has realized now because of Change,” he says. “They just had so much leverage.” As those attacks snowball—and some health care victims have likely forked over their own ransoms to control the damage to their life-saving systems—the attacks aren't likely to stop. “It’s always looked like an easy target,” DiMaggio notes. “Now it looks like an easy target that’s willing to pay.” Updated 6/12/24 9:35am ET: This story has been updated to reflect that ransomware incident totals comprise the fist four months of the year, not just April."
32,Dell Cameron,Ransomware Attacks Are Getting Worse,https://www.wired.com/story/security-news-this-week-ransomware-attacks-are-getting-worse/,"Plus: US lawmakers have nothing to say about an Israeli influence campaign aimed at US voters, a former LA Dodgers owner wants to fix the internet, and more.",2024-06-15T10:30:00Z,"Dell Cameron Despite years worth of efforts to eliminate the scourge of ransomware targeting schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure worldwide, experts are warning that the crisis is only heating up, with criminal gangs growing ever more aggressive in their tactics. The threat of real-world violence now looms, some experts warn, as the data stolen grows increasingly sensitive and millions in potential profits hang in the balance. “We know where your CEO lives,” read a message reportedly received by one victim. Attacks targeting the medical sector are blooming in response to the $44 million payout by Change Healthcare this March. United States lawmakers and intelligence officials are circling their wagons following the revelation of Israel’s involvement in a malign influence campaign that targeted US voters—an attempt by America’s Middle East ally to artificially boost support for an increasingly unpopular war that was kicked off by Hamas’ unprecedented Oct. 7th attack. The sock-puppet operation, which was launched by an Israeli contractor on X, Facebook, and Instagram and utilized OpenAI’s ChatGPT software, impersonated mostly Black Americans and targeted “Black and Democratic” lawmakers. A weeks’ worth of efforts by WIRED to get answers from US officials who may have been notified about the operation prior to a vote on enhancing military aide to Israel went ignored. Strikingly, the National Security Council denied having ever heard of it. Frank McCourt, a real estate mogul and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, explained why he’s spearheading an effort to purchase TikTok, which the United States is slated to ban unless its current owner, ByteDance, decides to sell the platform to a US company—a decision that will undoubtedly require the consent of the Chinese government. McCourt sees the internet as being imperiled by closed-off platforms like Facebook and X and is embracing the growing interest in decentralized networks. Decentralized platforms such as Mastodon have been popular among a subset of users for many years, allowing people to effectively own their own social networks and moderate them according to their own rules. These private networks are free to connect with others using the same software but can also sever connections to communities that embrace harmful content. (Think of these user-controlled networks as “islands” with diplomatic ties between them.) McCourt says purchasing and decentralizing TikTok could be the first step in raising the internet out of the siloed swamp that it is today thanks to Meta and its competitors. But that’s not all. Each week, we round up the security news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories, and stay safe out there. A bombshell Reuters investigation has unearthed a malign influence campaign launched by the US military at the height of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign utilized sock-puppet accounts on X, Facebook, and Instagram and was focused on convincing citizens of the Philippines that vaccines produced by China were dangerous and—preying on the religious beliefs of Muslims—full of pig parts. Infectious disease experts expressed dismay at the Pentagon’s actions. According to Reuters, the campaign was ordered to an end by the Biden White House shortly after the president’s inauguration, though the Pentagon was apparently slow to enact the commander in chief’s orders. The private contractor responsible for producing the Pentagon’s disinformation was recently awarded a $493 million US government contract. ProPublica recounts how, in 2016, a top cybersecurity specialist raised alarms about a cloud-based vulnerability at Microsoft, a major US government contractor. The weakness threatened to expose national security secrets among other sensitive data. The specialist “pleaded” with the company to address the problem, but his concerns were dismissed by the tech giant as it strived to secure a multibillion-dollar government contract in the cloud computing space. Frustrated, the specialist quit the company and, months later, as predicted, Russian hackers carried out SolarWinds, one of the largest cyberattacks in US history. The reporting brings into question testimony by Microsoft president Brad Smith, who assured Congress in 2016 there was no way the hackers had exploited his company’s software. Three Black men jailed in the US for crimes they didn't commit—after having been falsely identified by police face-recognition software—are speaking out against pending legislation in California that lawmakers claim would protect citizens from such egregious mistakes. The men say the bill, which passed with unanimous support from the state assembly last month and now is under scrutiny in its upper chamber, would have done nothing to stop them from being falsely arrested. Said one of the men: “In my case, as in others, the police did exactly what AB 1814 would require them to do,” adding, “Once the facial recognition software told them I was the suspect, it poisoned the investigation. This technology is racially biased and unreliable and should be prohibited.” While much of the scrutiny facing the data broker industry concerns its power to monitor people’s movements and attendance at sensitive locations such abortion clinics and mental health facilities, there’s another issue at play: Much of the data it markets is “inaccurate trash,” The Record reports. A chief privacy officer at Acxiom, a leading third-party data broker, acknowledged as much in an interview last month, saying the “inferences” drawn by his company are, at best, “informed guesses.” Experts are growing increasingly concerned about the downstream effects, with some highlighting how insurance companies are relying more and more on data brokers to inform how much customers should pay. Another expert tells The Record that data brokers may be incentivized not to scrutinize the data too closely, noting that customers aren’t too worried if a fraction of it leads them to false assumptions.

33,Jeremy White,Swatch Drops Three New Earth-Based MoonSwatches (We Want Two Of Them),https://www.wired.com/story/swatch-drops-three-new-earth-based-moonswatches-we-want-two-of-them/,"Seemingly in response to last month's TAG Heuer-Kith mashup, Swatch looks closer to home for its next space-based Omega collaboration.",2024-06-12T10:22:49Z,"By Jeremy White Less than three months after the launch of the Snoopy MoonSwatch, Swatch has this morning dropped not one but three new models, this time all based on our home planet. The new watches, according to Swatch, have been inspired by the fact that “all throughout history, people have wondered what the world looks like from above.” Mission on Earth Lava takes its bright red hue from volcanic molten rock, with the chronograph seconds hand in orange, as a nod to the Omega 1968 Speedmaster Moonwatch “Ultraman” model. Mission on Earth Polar Lights is vivid, almost neon turquoise representing the aurora borealis—the natural phenomenon where charged particles from the sun interact with molecules in the Earth’s upper atmosphere to produce the signature light show. Its dark blue dial has tiny silver-colored flecks inspired by aventurine glass dials, something of a trend in watchmaking right now. The distribution of these flakes is different on every model. The bright red Mission on Earth Lava boasts a chrono seconds hand in orange, as a nod to the Omega 1968 Speedmaster Moonwatch “Ultraman.” Mission on Earth Desert is the least striking of the three, as its beige tone is supposed to evoke the seas of sand on the planet’s surface. The key hook for Swatch is that all three natural phenomena can be seen clearly from space. The news comes right after TAG Heuer released a revamped F1 watch, which some consider to be its reply to the MoonSwatch despite it costing $1,350, considerably more than Swatch’s offering. TAG's Formula 1, which appeared in 1986, was at the time viewed as the brand’s answer to the cheap, original Swatch which had revolutionized the market three years earlier—but boasting a much higher spec. The reborn TAG Heuer Formula 1 | Kith is a limited-edition collaboration with Kith, which marks the first time TAG Heuer has ever cobranded a watch dial. Featuring Kith’s “Just Us” slogan on the dial, it’s a clear nod to the watch company’s keenness to engage with Gen Z consumers. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The turquoise Mission on Earth Polar Lights sports a dark blue dial with silver-colored flecks inspired by aventurine glass dials—the layout of these flakes will be different on each watch. The three new MoonSwatches are priced at $270 (£240 in the UK) and will be available from this Saturday, June 15, in select Swatch stores worldwide, and as with previous releases, only one watch can be purchased per person, per day, and per Swatch store. Swatch is staunchly sticking with its refusal to sell the MoonSwatch online, despite Nick Hayek Jr., chief executive of Swatch Group, admitting to considering the possibility post-launch of the initial batch of 11 Swatch watches paying homage to the iconic Speedmaster Moonwatch, but battery-powered, in bright colors, and made from Swatch’s “ecoplastic” alternative, Bioceramic. “Ask me in four months if ecommerce can play a role,” he told WIRED in July 2022. “Perhaps. I don't know.” Nearly two years later, still no new MoonSwatch has been officially sold new online, nor does it look likely they will be any time soon. The Mission on Earth Desert is the least striking of the three, but its more muted sand tones could make the piece a more wearable watch. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano In March, the much-awaited Snoopy MoonSwatch dropped, and while it too was equipped with the chronograph function, it also sported a moon phase, showing the different lunar phases on the subdial at 2 o’clock, complete with the Peanuts character lying on the celestial satellite—the first time Swatch ever combined a moon phase with a chrono. Different from these vibrant (well, two of the three, anyway) new models, the two Snoopy MoonSwatches were monochrome affairs in all black and all white. TAG Heuer has revamped its iconic 1980s F1 watch as the Formula 1 | Kith, a limited-edition reissue designed to engage with Gen Z consumers, which was almost the same objective for Swatch's MoonSwatch. The Omega and Snoopy space connection stems from NASA’s Silver Snoopy award, a silver pin first awarded in 1968 for outstanding achievements related to flight safety or mission success. Omega was given the Silver Snoopy in 1970, after Jack Swigert used his Speedmaster on the Apollo 13 mission to time a critical 14-second rocket engine burn, ensuring the crew's safe return to Earth. Interestingly, it wasn’t until 2003 that Omega made the first in a series of Snoopy Speedmasters to commemorate this. The colorways of the original MoonSwatches were inspired by planets in the solar system: the Mission to the Sun in bright yellow, the Mission to Neptune in deep blue, the Mission to Jupiter in beige and orange, and of course the black Mission to the Moon, resembling the Omega original. Clearly now hooked on the revenue generated from its super successful Omega collaboration, after mining the solar system, its sister brand's Snoopy connection, and now these multiple Earth models, one wonders where Swatch's lucrative MoonSwatch mission can go next."
34,Charlie Thomas,Alpine's A290 EV Has a Built-In Gran Turismo-Style Driving Instructor,https://www.wired.com/story/alpines-hot-hatch-ev-has-a-built-in-gran-turismo-style-driving-instructor/,"The French brand’s first new car in seven years combines rally looks, F1-inspired tech and on-board skill challenges using sensor data to make the whole car become a game controller.",2024-06-13T11:26:33Z,"Charlie Thomas Alpine doesn’t release new cars very often. Its last, and until now only new model, the A110, was first launched in 2017. But a lot has changed since then, not least the continuing electrification of the automotive world. Enter the A290, Alpine’s first new car in seven years, and the first in the French brand’s all-electric future lineup. If the A290 looks familiar, that’s because it’s essentially the sporty version of the new Renault 5 E-Tech, which itself was unveiled in early 2024. Its nostalgic, boxy looks take direct inspiration from its predecessor, the original Renault 5. Once France’s best-selling car, it enjoyed a long reign of success from 1972 all the way until 1996, selling more than 5 million units. The new R5 will aim to replicate that popularity in pure electric form, with added cuteness supplied by an official “baguette holder” accessory (yes, really), while the Alpine A290’s lineage can be traced to the souped up Renault 5 Alpines and Turbos from the same era. This is apparent when you see one in the metal. At the A290’s brand-hosted unveiling in Paris, a number of models were presented in various shades, including a new, more vibrant version of “Alpine Blue,” the color found on the brand’s Formula One and Le Mans cars. The car’s arches are swollen to accommodate the large 21-inch wheels, which sit 60 mm wider than the standard R5. It has flared side skirts, and front and rear spoilers that allude to its performance potential. Most notably are the rear lights, which sit high and long on each edge in reference to the 1980s original. This is where the A290 differs from the A110, which was developed in-house from the ground up. The A290 is actually more of a modification job, with the team at Alpine’s parent company Renault doing much of the work before handing Alpine a rolling chassis, and design, to build on. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The A290 is built on Renault’s new AmpR Small platform, which it shares with the R5. “It's the Renault guys that worked with the 5 from the past,” says Antony Villain, vice president of Alpine design. “Our work was more to bring this car into the Alpine world. We didn’t dig much into the Renault 5 Alpine or Turbo from the past, even if the bodywork is reminiscent. That is more Renault’s [work].” “We were working on a more progressive and futuristic approach rather than celebrating the past,” Villain adds. “Renault used [the R5] as more of a nod to the icon, but for us it’s really about bringing it into something more contemporary, and in some way closer to the A110.” We’ll have to wait a little longer to find out whether it’s close to the A110 dynamically. But Alpine has been steadfast in its aims for fun with the A290. It’s designed to be a “new generation hot hatch, which redefines sportiness for the next generation who want electric power,” says Villain. But it’s also designed to be accessible. It doesn’t break any records with its top-of-the-range 220-bhp motor, which takes the car from standstill to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds. This does, however, trump the A290’s nearest rival, the Mini Cooper Electric, which does the same in 7.3 seconds. The car comes as standard with a 52-kWh battery, for a range of up to approximately 235 miles, which is slightly under the Mini’s 249-mile effort. There’s 100-kW DC fast-charging, which can go from 15 to 80 percent in 30 minutes. For AC charging units, the onboard 11-kW charger can recharge from 50 to 80 percent in one hour and 20 minutes. Over a longer period, it can go from 10 to 80 percent in three hours and 20 minutes. Where the Alpine really excels is with the car’s weight. It’s just under 300 kilograms lighter than the Mini, weighing 1,479 kilograms. This combined with the bespoke subframe and “skateboard” battery, which sits low underneath the car, should greatly benefit the handling. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Another win over its Renault 5 sibling is a multi-link rear suspension, which promises a pointy front end, while Alpine-engineered front and rear anti-roll bars should add further balance and poise. Alpine has also spent time perfecting the feel of the brake pedal, promising an “imperceptible natural transition between regenerative braking at the beginning of the pedal travel and hydraulic braking.” Large Brembo units do much of the heavy lifting here, but we’ll let you know whether this has been a success when we review the EV properly. One stat as a result of this weight loss and superior brake setup is impressive, however: This EV can drop from 62 mph to a standstill in just three seconds—so interested parties should perhaps start training up their neck muscles. There are other ways Alpine is looking to engage the driver. There are four driving modes: Save, Normal, Sport, and Personal, the last of which allows a customized throttle response, steering assistance, and “Alpine Driving Sound.” The latter is a newly developed system that accentuates the noise coming from the electric motor and pumps it through the audio system into the car. So, while there’s still trickery going on here, at least the noise generated isn’t entirely fake. Speaking of audio, Alpine has patriotically partnered with Devialet, a respected French audiophile brand, for its sound system. An optional-extra package, it consists of a 615-watt amplifier, a 30-cm subwoofer, and nine loudspeakers. After a very brief listening session from the back seat, I was left impressed by the clarity of sound and the deep but not overpowering bass. It’s definitely a box to tick on the spec list. As a side note, if you are taller than 5'9"", you will struggle for leg room in the back. If you find yourself behind the wheel, you’ll notice the two large screens, which have become the standard for all new EVs. There’s a 10.1-inch central screen angled toward the driver which displays the Google-based, but attractively Alpine-skinned, operating system. And for those who value tactility, there are a number of physical buttons below it to control the heating and air conditioning. But anyone hoping for Renault 5 Turbo-style speedometers and rev counters will be disappointed with the screen that replaces them. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The steering wheel is large and sporty, and also features an array of buttons. Chief among them are the F1-inspired “RCH” and “OV” controls. The former allows the driver to set the regeneration level, from complete freewheel through to “Level 3,” which will significantly slow the car when off the accelerator pedal. That OV button on the other hand adds an overtake power boost, just like in Pierre Gasly’s A524. Push it for maximum torque and power for up to 10 seconds. It will then require 30 seconds to “cool down” before it can be used again. Important note: It doesn’t add extra power if your foot is already flat to the floor. Essentially this is a novel way of overtaking that Alpine thinks will impress your friends. There’s much more novelty to be found with what Alpine is dubbing “Challenges.” These are a series of 36 video-game-like “missions” that measure driver skill (to some extent), and can be accessed through the car’s onscreen menus. They range from an acceleration challenge that measures the time it takes you to go from 0-60 mph, through to endurance challenges that help teach “anticipation in driving.” They are akin to Gran Turismo–style license tests, where drivers are given a bronze, silver, or gold ranking at the end of each. Live data is taken from the car's array of sensors monitoring agility, g-force, steering, braking and power, endurance, temperature, and tire pressure. This is then combined with onscreen text and animations to first tell you how to nail each challenge, and then let you know whether you have passed or not. Drivers are scored out of 100, and you can't progress on to the next challenge until you pass the last one. You can also share (read: boast about) how you've done with others via an app. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano While these challenges at launch will start with a text and animated briefing, then end with data analysis on how drivers have done, Alpine confirmed to WIRED that it is going to roll out live feedback versions of these challenges, where your progress and data are relayed onscreen as you “play” while driving in the tests, as a coming over-the-air update. In theory, this means the A290 could coach you on how to drift perfectly round corners mid-maneuver. Some of Alpine’s tests are designed for the race track, while others are for the open road. The car will let the driver know when it’s appropriate to accept a closed-road challenge, but somewhat disappointingly won’t be able to intervene if the driver chooses to ignore it—in the same way that launch control and drift modes work in other vehicles. Still, one wonders how insurers will feel about such baked-in encouragement of certain driving styles. Despite being internal combustion powered, the Alpine A110 is one of the best true sports cars on sale today. Time will tell whether the £36,000 A290 can replicate that success in hot-hatch form while being all electric. We'll find out later in 2024 in the UK and Europe, but the US may well, too, as the brand will be arriving there in 2027. And, yes, the A290 will indeed be launching with a raft of in-house add-ons—but, very sadly, no bread-carrying accessories."
35,Lauren Goode,AI Is Apple's Best Shot at Getting You to Upgrade Your iPhone,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-apples-best-shot-at-getting-you-to-upgrade-your-phone/,"Apple is limiting its new artificial intelligence features to new phones, in hopes of a sunny September.",2024-06-11T00:40:29Z,"Lauren Goode Apple’s new AI strategy might also play a key role in its upgrade-your-iPhone strategy. The company used its annual developer conference today as a platform to announce Apple Intelligence, a decidedly non-generative nomenclature for a suite of new AI features that, like other generative AI tools, are trained on massive datasets. Apple’s approach is an additive one, relying on the influence and footprint of its existing apps rather than spinning up a new chatbot or search engine that spits out humanlike responses. Once Apple Intelligence rolls out to iPhones, Macs, and iPads later this year, it's supposed to turn sketches into images, sort through photos and videos, rewrite emails, change the tone of messages, and allow the voice assistant Siri to tap into different apps to string together smarter responses. There’s just one catch: It won’t work on your old iPhone. Apple is limiting these AI features to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which run on Apple’s A17 Pro chip; the iPads Pro and Air, which run on Apple’s M1 chip or later versions; and various Mac computers that run on the M1 chip or later. The company hasn’t said exactly why it is limiting its Apple Intelligence features to the newest, and most expensive, hardware, though industry experts surmise that less-powerful chips would possibly create a less-performant AI and that Apple would draw the line at a lackluster tool. (At the time of writing Apple hadn’t responded to inquiries from WIRED.) But whether this limitation is a technical requirement or a product-differentiation strategy, it might be Apple’s best shot at convincing customers to upgrade to newer iPhones this fall. An iPhone powered by large language models and focused on new AI-personalization features “should change the growth trajectory of Cupertino–spur an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle starting with iPhone 16,” tweeted Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities and a longtime Apple analyst. The new AI features are being rolled out at the same time Apple’s iPhone sales have slumped. In May, when the company reported its earnings for the January through March period, Apple saw a 10 percent year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and the biggest drop in sales since the summer of 2020, when some factories had to close. Its revenue last quarter decreased 4 percent from a year ago on account of the iPhone sales dip. Apple’s gross margin last quarter was still healthy, but that was due largely to its growing services business. Apple’s phone hardware has enabled plenty of new features and functions over the past several years, but some of these have become commoditized or are layered in abstraction. Its custom-designed iPhone and iPad chips are bleeding edge and help sell top-of-the-line phones to the nerdiest or wealthiest consumers, but “CoreML on Apple silicon” isn’t as big of a selling point for consumers seeking midrange phones. While new iPhones have iteratively better cameras each year, high-end phones from rivals like Samsung and Google also have advanced photo and video systems. The same goes for convenience features, like wireless charging. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano This trend bears out in secondary market data: Shipments of used smartphones increased nearly 10 percent, to 309.4 million shipments, in 2023, up from 282.6 million units the year prior, according to research firm IDC. For a lot of people, a good phone really is just good enough. Apple is also selling privacy as part of its generative AI package, saying that Apple Intelligence “is integrated into the core of your iPhone, iPad, and Mac through on-device processing.” Apple’s AI tools use Apple-developed large language models, instead of relying on another entity’s models or a patchwork of LLMs, as confirmed by Axios. In instances where an iPhone isn’t capable of processing a user’s actions on their device, Apple Intelligence will send the request to a server running on Apple silicon, which will keep that user’s personal data secure, the company says. Which raises the question: If Apple is already planning to offload some of the processing to its cloud, then couldn’t an older iPhone—like the iPhone 14 Pro, which is powered by a slightly older chip—also get the AI glow-up? Michael Gartenberg, a consumer technology analyst at Flash Advisory & Research who previously worked at Apple, says he can’t technically say at this point whether Apple “is being disingenuous about what devices can run this. But I do know iPhones can already run ChatGPT and an awful lot of Google’s AI features, so I suspect this is the opportunity Apple has been waiting for to tell you that the iPhone 13 really isn’t good enough anymore,” he says. Another question the introduction of Apple Intelligence raises is whether it gives consumers a reason not to buy an iPhone before this upcoming fall, Gartenberg says, which stalls the current iPhone buying cycle. (And that’s assuming buyers want the generative AI features at all; Pew survey results suggest Americans are slightly more concerned than excited about generative AI.) And, since Apple Intelligence will be available only in US English to start, it’s unlikely to immediately boost iPhone sales elsewhere—like in China, one of Apple’s most important markets—unless Apple does some critical “futureproofing,” says Carolina Milanesi, founder of the research firm Heart of Tech. “It depends on how they roll out experiences to other countries,” she says, like if AI-generated Genmoji are offered as a feature before text editing or other language-based features. “The bigger update cycle will happen next year, when more languages are added,” Milanesi predicts. And in China specifically, Apple has to not only develop language support but determine how it will handle data storage, she says. Either way Apple now has a new way to compel iPhone buyers to upgrade come September. This time it won't just try to sell them on a new camera jammed into the same container; it will try its hardest to convince customers that the newest iPhone is a much smarter smartphone, one that offers a flavor of generative AI much more palatable than the AI chat platforms still in search of application."
36,Tim Barber,Panerai’s Submersible Elux Lab-ID Dive Watch Generates Its Own Light Show,https://www.wired.com/story/panerai-submersible-elux-lab-id/,"You have to pay $100,000 for a timepiece with a singularly hi-tech route to make 160 micro-LED lights come on without any battery to power them.",2024-06-15T11:00:00Z,"Tim Barber Equipping a wristwatch with a button to make its display light up can hardly be described as groundbreaking nowadays. Early digital watches were doing that in the 1970s, while rudimentary light-on-demand dials, such as Timex’s celebrated Indiglo system, have been commonplace since the 1990s (and Apple, arguably, has reduced the concept simply to a button-free flick of the wrist). So would you pay $96,300 (£92,400) for a hulking luxury dive watch that pulled a similar trick? On the face of it, that’s what Panerai, the Swiss-Italian brand, is proposing with its new limited-edition watch, the 49-mm Submersible Elux Lab-ID, whose functional novelty is indeed a button to make its indications light up. Only, there’s nothing rudimentary about the way it achieves its glow-up. Dripping with patents, it takes a singularly hi-tech route to making the lights come on—and stay on, in multiple indications, including those that move—without using a battery to power them. The brand is making 150 of the watches over the next three years, and it says it’s having to train watchmakers in assembling microscopic LEDs, circuitry, and components of a distinctly non-horological nature. At Panerai, as with most high-end watch brands, the divide between mechanics and electronics is regarded as a sacred line to be treated with utmost caution. “There has never been any battery in any Panerai watch,” the brand’s CEO, Jean-Marc Pontroué, declares in a Zoom call to explain the watch. “Panerai,” he says, “is known for big, tough, mechanical, masculine instruments—and while it might have been easier to incorporate batteries, it goes against our ethos.” Batteries, according to Pontroué it seems, are for wusses. On the other hand, Panerai, whose aesthetic descends from watches supplied to Italian military divers in the 1940s, sets plenty of store on the idea of strong luminosity. Bold, glow-in-the-dark indications were a key function of those historic models, and have remained central to the brand’s modern design language. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Additionally, the novel deployment of “lume” has become something of a power play in luxury watchmaking: It’s only a couple of weeks, for instance, since IWC announced a concept watch that is entirely aglow, while instances of lume as an aesthetic medium, rather than something functional, have abounded in recent years. But where Panerai is going with the Supermersible Elux Lab-ID, we don’t need lume. Instead, a host of LEDs illuminate the watch’s functions, powered by electricity generated in the movement. A push-button on the left side of the case switches the lights on; pressing it again turns them off. And that simple concept is something the brand’s special projects team, which operates under the moniker “Laboratoriao di Idee” (shortened to Lab-ID), has spent eight years bringing to fruition, says Pontroué. “They have a brief which can basically be written on a stamp: It has to give the time, and it has to have patents,” he says, stating that patents themselves are the ultimate goal, as much as the product that emerges. “It’s the only project where we have no idea of the deadline. We know it can be very expensive, and the failure rate is very high. But it’s not merely about introducing something new for Panerai, it must also be groundbreaking for the industry.” The first of four patents for the Submersible Elux Lab-ID (we’ll call it the Elux for short) relates to its activation button: A safety device protects it from both impact and water pressure. “Without this, the pressure of the water when you’re diving could push it down inadvertently, so a component underneath it protects that,” says Anthony Serpry, Panerai’s head of R&D, who heads up the Lab-ID skunkworks. Serpry says his team has around 150 projects on the go, but only a few will see the light of day. One more of these is the watch’s blue-ish case material, which is also patented. A form of ceramized titanium that the brand has named Ti-Ceramitech, it comprises a titanium alloy that’s subjected to plasma electrolytic oxidation (applying a high pulse of current within an electrolytic bath), which generates a thick, scratch-proof layer of blue ceramic across the surface. “The patent is covering the material development and especially the titanium alloy composition, to reach the blue color,” says Serpry. But the real business here, of course, is the light show. A handful of high-end watchmakers have previously experimented with mechanically powered light-on-demand, among them HYT, De Bethune, and the jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, but with limited results—a dull glow for a few seconds. Panerai’s tech, on the other hand, lights up scores of micro-LEDs throughout the watch’s display, with a stated capacity of 30 minutes’ glow time. In fact, the illumination should last as long as the wearer keeps moving: The Elux is a self-winding watch, and the oscillating weight that winds up its movement also winds the mechanism to make it glow. It does this by packing in extra barrels, which are the cylinders that contain a watch’s mainspring, its store of energy. Most mechanical watches have one of these—the Elux has six. Two power the timekeeping; the other four generate electrical energy via a minuscule—but powerful—dynamo device. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Pressing the left-hand pusher releases a brake on these barrels, allowing the springs to unwind in series. A tiny gear train dramatically accelerates the rotational speed, culminating in a rotor whipping around at 80 revolutions per second. It’s attached to a microgenerator, measuring just 8 mm x 2.3 mm, with six coils, plus magnets and a stator, which converts the mechanical energy into a 240-Hz signal. Making electricity is one thing, but the real challenge, according to Serpry, is in what you do with it. In total, there are 160 micro-LEDs in the watch. Many of these lie beneath the indications on the dial—the large, glowing hour markers each sit above groups of five to 10 LEDs, which are diffused via a translucent surface. Less straightforward is delivering consistent electrical charge to the rotating bezel and the hands—the parts that move. “It’s hard to believe,” says Serpry, “but 30 to 40 percent of the complexity of the entire project is just in the hands.” He says that each hand alone contains around 30 micro-components, made by 10 different specialist manufacturers. The Elux, in fact, is the first Panerai watch in which the elements outside the movement contain more parts than the movement itself. Initially, the team tried placing LEDs on the dial and using reflectors to direct the light to the hands, but this used too much energy. Instead, five micro-LEDs (“the smallest we could find on the market”) are placed inside the hands—meaning power needs to be transferred into the hands as they move. For that, a cannon pinion (a component that governs the motion of the hands) made of ion polymer, and bearing conductive golden tracks created by gold deposition, is encircled by microscopic springs: These maintain a circuit while minimizing friction. The rotating bezel presented a different challenge. As a hardcore dive watch, the Elux has a bezel that can be turned in one direction to indicate a dive’s duration; it also has 500-meter water resistance. Lighting up the bezel’s central marker dot, therefore, meant getting electricity into what’s effectively a separate component outside the watch case, and doing so without compromising water resistance. The connector the team devised, featuring nested tubes and seals, uses technology normally found in submarines, according to Serpry. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Inside the bezel is a static ring housing 60 micro-LEDs. To conserve energy, only the LEDs directly below the rotating bezel’s dot are illuminated at any given time; swivel the bezel, and different sets of LEDs light up. That’s achieved using magnetic switches: Small magnets embedded in the bezel correspond to the position of the dot, and when a magnet passes over a switch, it activates the corresponding LEDs. Both the hands and the bezel technology have patents too. So does this have any application beyond a show-off light display? “It’s something that we are considering at the moment,” says Serpry, “because once you have this electricity, you can play with it and do many different things. We’re testing other features, but luminosity was the obvious target.” The word “Elux,” an abbreviation of “elettroluminescenza” (electroluminescence) is fitting but not new: It was first used by Panerai in the 1960s, when it was a small Florentine family business supplying high-viz instrumentation and equipment, as well as watches, for naval and military purposes. Elux, it turns out, was a technology it came up with for creating robust panels that could glow in different colors when connected to a power source. Panerai, which is today owned by Richemont Group (home of Cartier and IWC, among others), has sometimes been accused of playing fast and loose with its history—not least in 2020, when it over-egged the backstory of its glowing Luminor compound (now the name of one of its cornerstone watch lines) by claiming to have been using tritium in 1949, at a time when the substance was unavailable and almost impossible to produce. With Elux, it appears to be on firmer ground. Historic patents and documentation seen by WIRED bear this out, and they suggest a technology that, for its time, was indeed groundbreaking. Elux used novel, multilayer structures to integrate then-emerging electroluminescent technology into thin, flexible, battery-powered devices, with use cases including military instrumentation, internal signage in ships, and luminous guidance for helicopter landing decks. According to the brand, over 10,000 Elux units were produced. While this bears no relation to anything found in the new watch, besides providing a fitting name, there’s an irony in the fact that it does stand, in fact, as a forerunner for the most famous glow-on-demand watches: Timex’s Indiglo system works on the same principles. For Panerai, then, perhaps a battery would not be so off-message after all."

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 7/10 Signia’s vast range of hearing aids includes, by my count, a whopping 20 different models, but one of the smallest and most discreet is the company's Silk X line. There are currently five different sub-models within the Silk X lineup, the most advanced and most expensive of which is the Silk 7X, reviewed here. Note, however, that while it's still being actively marketed, Signia says the Silk X line is considered “outdated technology” and will eventually be phased out in favor of the Silk Charge&Go IX line. The Silk 7X are a pint-sized powerhouse that sit completely in the ear canal and are virtually invisible save for the tiny retrieval wires that stick out just above your earlobes. Weighing in at 1.34 grams each, their heft is kept at a minimum by using tiny replaceable batteries (size #10) instead of rechargeable ones. Distinguishing right from left is easy: The right aid is clad completely in translucent red plastic, the left in blue. No hunting for tiny R and L signposts here. To turn the aids off, open the battery hatch a bit. Close it to turn them on again. Aside from the color scheme, the aids themselves may appear familiar in design—specifically, they look a lot like Sony’s CRE-C10 hearing aids, which were released as part of the first wave of over-the-counter hearing aids back in 2022. Sony’s version is all black but otherwise identical in appearance. That’s for a reason: Signia is Sony’s hearing aid technology partner, and it made the C10 (as well as Sony’s E10 model) for the company. Why would Signia make two versions of the same hearing aid? That’s a complicated question, but the crux is that Sony’s model is purely over-the-counter, with no audiologist visit required (or available), whereas Signia’s Silk X line comprises prescription models you can get only through a professional. This matters a great deal, and which type of hearing aid you purchase depends heavily on how much handholding you want and need. Case in point: Sony’s C10s aren’t the easiest to set up—they don’t have a Bluetooth connection—so novices may become frustrated during the delicate configuration process, which is performed via high-frequency sound waves emitted by your phone. The C10s also rely on an in-app hearing test to tune them to your hearing profile. On the other hand, the Silk 7X are configured in person by an audiologist. The user doesn’t have to do a thing except get themselves to the doctor’s office. Functionally, I didn’t notice any real difference between the two models—though I do not have Sony C10s on hand anymore to test them side by side—and I even had the same notes about the default settings causing the bass to be too heavy on the Silk 7X. There’s no way to make any major adjustments in the mobile app—Signia’s AI-powered Signia Assistant isn’t available on this device —aside from adjusting volume, sliding balance between “soft” and “sharp,” and making directional hearing choices that let you focus on sounds originating from all around you, just one side, or somewhere in between. Signia Silk 7X Rating: 7/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED It’s important to note that the Silk 7X do not support media streaming since there are no wireless functions. A feature called Twin Phone is supposed to offer a hack of sorts that lets you hold your phone up to one ear and transfer the audible phone signal to both, but I could never get this to work (or find any documentation on it outside of a mention in a FAQ on Signia’s website). Limitations aside, the units sound very good out of the gate—just like the Sony C10—with minimal hiss and minor feedback that’s noticeable only when you’re inserting and removing the devices from your ears. While the Silk 7X supports four styles of eartips, only one style came in the box, a set of medium-size vented sleeves that create a bit more of an isolating effect than I’d like. Different sizes would be nice to experiment with—but paying users will likely receive whatever eartips they prefer as part of a professional fitting. Aside from being OTC versus prescription, the Sony C10 and Signia Silk X series have another big difference: the price. The cost of the Signia Silk 7X varies based on the audiologist from whom you purchase it, but the units we acquired run $5,445 per pair. (It’s also available as a single aid at half the price.) While the Sony C10 is purported to use the same technology as the lowest-end and least expensive Silk, the Silk 1X, the Sony C10’s price of $800 per pair (with current discounts) makes for a jaw-dropping contrast. The quality difference between them, not so much. I’ve long been on the record that those new to hearing aids should unequivocally start their journey with an over-the-counter model, most of which offer a lengthy money-back trial period for users to experiment with. The calculus here is a particularly easy one: If the Silk’s diminutive form factor interests you, start with the Sony C10 and work your way up from there if you feel like you need more professional help.

38,Julian Chokkattu,The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS 18,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-ios-18-ipados-18-new-features/,What exactly is Apple Intelligence? We break down Apple's AI onslaught plus all the features worth talking about in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.,2024-06-11T16:11:21Z,"Julian Chokkattu Apple executives always describe new hardware and software as the “best” or “biggest” ever, but the delivery doesn’t usually live up to the hype (see the recent iPads). However, the announcements Apple made at its annual developer conference—WWDC—might be deserving of a few of those adjectives. iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 have the usual degree of year-over-year quality-of-life improvements, but Apple Intelligence stole the show. This is Apple's implementation of the types of artificial-intelligence-powered tasks that have been sweeping through the tech industry over the past year. Even Siri is getting a much-needed upgrade—the biggest since the voice assistant’s debut 13 years ago. Here are all the new features in iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, and what exactly you’ll experience with Apple Intelligence when it all arrives this fall. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Good news! Every iPhone that was capable of installing iOS 17 can run iOS 18. Apple did not drop any iPhones from the list of supported devices this year. If you have the iPhone XR and iPhone XS from 2018 or newer (including the second- and third-gen iPhone SE), you can download and run iOS 18. If you're unsure what model iPhone you have, head to the Settings app, tap on General > About and look at the Model Name. This doesn't mean every feature is available, as some require more modern processors (Apple Intelligence, for example, is exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro models; more on this below). It’s a little more complicated for iPads since the naming scheme depends on the hardware generation rather than specific device names. Here are the generations that support iPadOS 18 (unlike iPhones, some iPads are no longer supported). You can figure out which model you have by following the directions here. Right now, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 are available exclusively for developers, but expect a public beta to land in July, which is when you'll be able to try out the new features. It'll be very buggy, so I always recommend backing up your iPhone before installing a beta. Check out our Best iPhones and Best iPads guides to learn more about current models. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Siri is getting an AI boost. Every major tech company has been integrating artificial intelligence into their hardware and software, from Google to Samsung to Microsoft, and now it's Apple's turn. Apple Intelligence is the term you'll see the company throwing around over the next few years, and it powers many of the new AI features in its devices. It's powered by the company's large language models (partly trained through data from the public web, according to Axios’ Ina Fried) and requires Apple silicon, the company's bespoke chips that have a hybrid architecture designed to run AI tasks. Even though the devices Apple Intelligence runs on are capable of the on-device processing to complete AI tasks, sometimes the task is too big and needs to be sent off to the cloud. When a task requires more processing, it'll be sent to a secure data center stacked with computers that also run Apple silicon. While this method of computing is typically less private, Apple claims that its Private Cloud Compute platform focuses on ensuring data privacy for each individual user. Only data that's relevant to your query is sent to these servers, and the data is only used for your requests and never stored. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Before you get too excited, it's worth noting that Apple Intelligence will not be available for every device that supports iOS 18. It's only available in US English and is exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, plus iPad devices and Macs running the M1 chipset and newer. (You will need to set Siri's language to English.) It's launching this fall as a beta in iOS 18, and even then, Apple says, several features won't be ready until 2025. So what exactly is Apple Intelligence? Apple breaks down its key capabilities into three buckets: Language, Images, and Action. Throughout Apple's hardware and software, you'll find new writing tools that draw on the power of generative AI to assist your writing. This includes Rewrite, which can help change the tone of your text to sound more friendly or more professional (like in an email), and Proofread, which more or less does what the name suggests. You can also summarize selected text with a tap. Apple Intelligence can read your notifications and offer quick summaries of what's inside. These text-based improvements go past writing. It also powers Priority notifications, which appear at the top of your notification list and summarizes it so you get a more digestible summary at a glance. Similarly, the Mail app will see Priority messages, which means important emails will float to the top of your inbox. You can also get summaries of long emails, and a Smart Reply function lets you quickly respond to emails (even answers to multiple questions posed in an email), not unlike what's available in Gmail. In the Notes and Phone app, you can hit the record button (yes, even on a call) to get an audio recording with a transcript, and Apple Intelligence can create a summary of that transcript. Apple says users in states that require two-party consent for recordings, the person on the other end of the line will be made aware that the call is being recorded. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Finally, there's a new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions that can understand your personal context, so while it hides incoming stuff that could distract you, it knows enough about what you've got going on to allow a text from your babysitter to come through. The Apple Intelligence image features largely revolve around generating new images through artificial intelligence. Much of this happens in Image Playground, an experience baked into other apps (though it also exists as a standalone app). You can generate images based on a description, suggested concepts, and even from people in your Photos library. You have control over the style, and it can be tweaked to match whatever's happening in the app you're using it in. Welcome to Genmoji. Genmoji just might be the most anticipated feature out of everything Apple has announced. It lets you generate emoji directly from the keyboard with text prompts. You can also pull a person's photo from your Photos library to make an emoji based on their looks. You'll have to provide a description first, but then you can adjust the description until it suits what you are going for. Image Wand is another image generation system that works specifically in the Notes app. With your finger or Apple Pencil, you can circle a sketch to have Apple Intelligence create something that looks more refined, but you can also circle empty space, and it will generate an image based on the surrounding text. It's an easy way to add more visual variety to your notes. Beach clean-up. The Photos app is getting a few AI features. You can make a Memory Movie by entering a description like, “All the desserts I ate during the summer last year, set to a pop song,” and Apple's AI will find the right images and video, put it to a song, and craft a sharable movie out of it. It'll also be easier to search for specific photos—just describe what you want and it'll find it, even moments in video clips (similar to Google's recently announced Ask Photos feature). Lastly, you can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos with the new Clean Up tool in the photo editor—exactly like Magic Eraser on Pixel phones and Samsung's Object Eraser. The final part of Apple Intelligence is arguably one that might be used the most often, and it involves Siri. The assistant has a new look—when activated, the edges of the screen will glow—and you can now type your requests to Siri instead of using your voice (something you've been able to do with Google Assistant for several years). By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The idea is you'll be able to speak more naturally with Siri. Ask and the assistant will be able to understand context better than ever before. You can say, “Play the podcast my wife sent me the other day,” and Siri will be able to pull it up. That kind of thing. Siri can also help explain how to do certain functions on your phone if you're not sure (maybe Samsung was onto something with Bixby). And if you make a mistake mid-sentence, there's no need to start all over again. Siri will be able to understand your slip-up, and it also understands the context of your previous query, so you won't need to repeat things over and over again. Much like how Google's Gemini is drawing on context based on what's happening on the screen, Siri can now understand what is on the screen when you activate it, so if someone texts you an address, you can activate Siri and ask it to add the address to the person's contact card. All of this is expected to work in first- and third-party apps. Apple Intelligence apparently still needs a boost for some occasions, and so Apple has tapped OpenAI's ChatGPT to power them. The company says it's using the GPT-4o model, and you are in control of when Siri uses ChatGPT. This powers features such as when you ask about the subject of a photo or a document (like scanning a hundred-page PDF), and Compose, which lets you generate original images and text from a query. All of these GPT features are free with no account required, though if you already are a subscriber, you can link your account and access paid features. OK, onto the more traditional software features. I've collected the top features in iOS 18 below, but there are tons of smaller changes. You can view the full list directly from Apple. Customize the app icons' style, color, and arrangement. For the first time, you can arrange your apps and widgets however you'd like (just like on Android). Say goodbye to the fixed list of grids Apple has forced on us for nearly two decades. You can make further personalization to the app icons as well, tuning them to a specific color to match or complement your wallpaper, and even convert them to dark mode. You can make these apps and widgets look larger too. Control Center. New styles. Control Center, the hub that appears when you swipe down on the right edge of the iPhone, is now more customizable. There are now tabs within the Control Center, and you can scroll through them with one continuous swipe on the home screen. These include your favorites—the most important things you want accessible in the Control Center—media playback, and even smart home controls. You can customize the size and layout of everything in Control Center, and this extends to the Lock Screen controls—you can switch out the two icons at the bottom of your iPhone's lock screen to something more helpful. Expect new controls from third-party apps. Shhh! Hide apps you don't want others to see that you have installed. You can finally hide apps to prevent anyone from snooping, or you can lock the app so that it asks for a passcode or biometric authentication every time it's launched. The information from this app will be hidden throughout the system, even in notifications and searches. Google debuted a similar new feature called Private Space, which is coming to Android later this year. Photos gets an organizational overhaul. Apple's Photos app got a huge app redesign in iOS 18. Now, you have a photo grid at the top, and below, you can swipe through different collections, such as Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. This upgrade is tied with several other improvements powered by Apple Intelligence, like Clean Up, which can erase unwanted objects in the background of your photos, and the ability to find any image easily via search. Arguably one of the most anticipated announcements from Apple ended up as a tiny footnote amid the company's announcements. RCS is Rich Communication Services, the texting standard that followed SMS/MMS. Android phones have supported RCS for several years, allowing for an upgraded texting experience that pulls features from instant messaging apps, like typing indicators, read receipts, and improved photo and video quality. However, none of this works when an Android user texts an iPhone (or vice versa) because Apple didn't support RCS and used the older SMS standard. That's changing now, “RCS messages bring richer media and deliver and read receipts for those who don't use iMessage,"" according to Apple's marketing materials. These texts will still appear green (instead of blue when you text fellow iPhone owners via iMessage), but it might finally spell the end of the broken texting experience that has caused so many people strife. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano If you have an iPhone 14 or newer, you can take advantage of texting via satellite when you don't have Wi-Fi or a cellular connection (like when you're on a plane). Apple says all of these iMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted. The Messages app itself is getting a few new perks too. You can add animated effects to any letter, word, or phrase—these are suggested as you type. And Apple's Tapback feature (emoji reactions) now works with any emoji or sticker. Most importantly, you can now schedule texts and send them at a specific time, a standard texting feature available in most messaging apps. It might be time to say goodbye to your password manager—at least, Apple would be thrilled if you did. The company's new native Passwords app supports end-to-end encryption and is about to become the way to find your passwords and ID verification codes on Apple devices. This app will work across all of Apple's hardware and even Windows (via the iCloud for Windows app). If you enable AutoFill, Apple says your passwords will automatically populate in the app. This is technically a feature in macOS Sequoia, but you will be able to access your iPhone's screen via the iPhone Mirroring app in the macOS Dock. You can completely use your Mac keyboard and trackpad to interact with the iPhone, even have audio from it play onto your Mac's speakers. It even supports drag and drop, so you can pull files from your virtual iPhone screen into your Mac. If you have an iPhone-specific notification, click on it from your Mac and it will launch your mirrored iPhone, allowing you to act on it without having to pick up your device. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano During all of this, your iPhone stays locked. It's worth noting many of the these iPad features are also available on iOS 18, and vice versa: almost all the iOS 18 features above are also coming to your iPad. Sadly, there's not much here in iPadOS 18 that makes the iPad more like a computer, but many of these additions are much appreciated. Now you don't have to feel bad about your chicken-scratch handwriting. Apple's Smart Script “re-creates” your handwriting, so you can scribble down as fast as you can and the system will refine it to be more legible. It can do all of this while apparently still keeping your handwriting style intact. Also, if you paste typed text into a Note that's been handwritten, it'll be converted to your handwriting. You can also scratch off text to erase it. The Calculator app is now finally available on the iPad, though it's far from basic. Apple has injected a feature called Math Notes with Apple Pencil. This lets you write equations and the app will compute and solve it as soon as you draw an equals sign. It can solve all the same functions as a scientific calculator."
39,Enzo Palombo,"With So Much Bird Flu Around, Are Eggs, Chicken, and Milk Still Safe to Consume?",https://www.wired.com/story/bird-flu-how-safe-are-eggs-chicken-milk-h5n1-h5n2/,A food microbiologist explains why you shouldn’t worry about consuming poultry or dairy—so long as you take the right precautions.,2024-06-08T11:30:00Z,"Enzo Palombo This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Recent outbreaks of bird flu—in US dairy herds, poultry farms in Australia, and elsewhere, and isolated cases in humans—have raised the issue of food safety. So can the virus transfer from infected farm animals to contaminate milk, meat, or eggs? How likely is this? And what do we need to think about to minimize our risk when shopping for or preparing food? Bird flu (or avian influenza) is a bird disease caused by specific types of influenza virus. But the virus can also infect cows. In the US, to date, more than 80 dairy herds in at least nine states have been infected with the H5N1 version of the virus. Investigations are under way to confirm how this happened. But we do know that infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. So bird flu can potentially contaminate animal-derived food products during processing and manufacturing. Indeed, fragments of bird flu genetic material (RNA) were found in cow’s milk from the dairy herds associated with infected US farmers. However, the spread of bird flu among cattle, and possibly to humans, is likely to have been caused through contact with contaminated milking equipment, not the milk itself. The test used to detect the virus in milk—which uses PCR technology similar to lab-based Covid tests—is also highly sensitive. This means it can detect very low levels of the bird flu RNA. But the test does not distinguish between live or inactivated virus, just that the RNA is present. So from this test alone, we cannot tell if the virus found in milk is infectious (and capable of infecting humans). Does that mean milk is safe to drink and won’t transmit bird flu? Yes and no. In Australia, where bird flu has not been reported in dairy cattle, the answer is yes. It is safe to drink milk and milk products made from Australian milk. In the US, the answer depends on whether the milk is pasteurized. We know pasteurization is a common and reliable method of destroying concerning microbes, including influenza virus. Like most viruses, influenza virus (including bird flu virus) is inactivated by heat. Although there is little direct research on whether pasteurization inactivates H5N1 in milk, we can extrapolate from what we know about heat inactivation of H5N1 in chicken and eggs. So we can be confident there is no risk of bird flu transmission via pasteurized milk or milk products. However, it’s another matter for unpasteurized or “raw” US milk or milk products. A recent study showed that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu developed signs of illness. So to be on the safe side, it would be advisable to avoid raw milk products. Bird flu has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide, including in Australia. In recent weeks, there have been three reported outbreaks in Victorian poultry farms (two with H7N3 bird flu, one with H7N9). There has been one reported outbreak in Western Australia (H9N2). The strains of bird flu identified in the Victorian and Western Australia outbreaks can cause human infection, although these are rare and typically result from close contact with infected live birds or contaminated environments. Therefore, the chance of bird flu transmission in chicken meat is remote. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Nonetheless, it is timely to remind people to handle chicken meat with caution as many dangerous pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, can be found on chicken carcasses. Always handle chicken meat carefully when shopping, transporting it home, and storing it in the kitchen. For instance, make sure no meat juices cross-contaminate other items, consider using a cool bag when transporting meat, and refrigerate or freeze the meat within two hours. Avoid washing your chicken before cooking to prevent the spread of disease-causing microbes around the kitchen. Finally, cook chicken thoroughly as viruses (including bird flu) cannot survive cooking temperatures. The recent Australian outbreaks have occurred in egg-laying or mixed poultry flocks, so concerns have been raised about bird flu transmission via contaminated chicken eggs. Can flu viruses contaminate chicken eggs and potentially spread bird flu? It appears so. A report from 2007 said it was feasible for influenza viruses to enter through the eggshell. This is because influenza virus particles are smaller (100 nanometers) than the pores in eggshells (at least 200 nm). So viruses could enter eggs and be protected from cleaning procedures designed to remove microbes from the egg surface. Therefore, like the advice about milk and meat, cooking eggs is best. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends cooking poultry, eggs, and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food. If you consume pasteurized milk products and thoroughly cook your chicken and eggs, there is nothing to worry about as bird flu is inactivated by heat. The real fear is that the virus will evolve into highly pathogenic versions that can be transmitted from human to human. That scenario is much more frightening than any potential spread though food."
40,"Morgan Meaker, Aarian Marshall",The $50 Billion Musk Referendum,https://www.wired.com/story/the-dollar50-billion-musk-referendum/,Tesla shareholders will decide whether to back Elon Musk’s leadership—and unprecedented 11-figure bonus—in a pivotal moment for the carmaker.,2024-06-12T09:30:00Z,"By Morgan Meaker and Aarian Marshall Elon Musk is a man comfortable with risky bets. He pledged to send 1 million people to Mars (SpaceX), to fill factories with humanoid workers (Tesla Bot), and to create a network of highways deep underground (the Boring Company). All of these bets are yet to pay off. But six years ago, Musk took a leap of faith that would also affect him personally. He tied his own pay at Tesla to a series of financial targets over the next decade, including boosting the company’s market value from $59 billion to $650 billion. Such targets were decried by commentators at the time as “jaw-dropping” and “his most unlikely goal yet.” And Musk’s wage from the company if he didn’t pull them off? Nothing at all. The board agreed to the plan in 2018. However, a heavy-metal drummer named Richard Tornetta, who owned just nine Tesla shares, did not. In June of that year, he decided to sue, claiming the pay package was unfair to investors like him. By the time the case reached court in Delaware in 2022, Musk had just one milestone left before the big payout. But the judge agreed with Tornetta in January, voiding what she called an unfathomably large pay package and describing the directors who negotiated it as beholden to Musk. Musk succeeded in hitting those 12 jaw-dropping targets by the close of 2023, following Tesla’s brief spell as a trillion-dollar company. And now, despite what happened in Delaware, he’s demanding to be paid. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders are being asked to vote again on whether Musk should receive what has by now swollen to a nearly $50 billion pay package, the biggest in US corporate history. The $50 billion question for shareholders is: Is Musk worth it? Posing the question of whether he deserves his pay packet at all marks a significant shift for the relationship between Musk and the electric automaker he has led since 2008. “The resistance shows that there is a ceiling to the influence that a single person has on the company,” says Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at the consultancy Gartner. “This is the the first time Tesla shareholders might be willing to say, ‘You can’t have unlimited power.’” The vote comes at a difficult time for Tesla. For the first time in the company’s history, Tesla is facing intense competition in the electric car market—especially from cheaper Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, some observers have puzzled over Musk’s response and his pivot to robotaxis and artificial intelligence. “The debate here really is about the future, not the past,” says John Colley, professor of practice in strategy and leadership at the UK’s Warwick Business School. “Tesla has become a mature business, and it’s got all the problems that mature carmakers have now.” Whether a visionary like Musk is the best man to lead a mature business is unclear, he adds. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The pay package is just one in a series of measures that shareholders have already been asked to vote on by proxy, ahead of Thursday’s meeting. Others include whether Tesla’s incorporation should move from Delaware to Texas, whether the company should soften its hardline stance on labor negotiations, and whether the company should preemptively impose a moratorium on using minerals mined from the seabed. Yet none have been as divisive as Musk’s pay. Deep rifts among investors have been exposed in the lead-up to the vote. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm has backed the pay package, as has billionaire investor Ron Baron. “Tesla is better with Elon,” Baron wrote in an open letter last week. “Tesla is Elon.” Yet the deal’s opponents include two influential proxy advisory groups, which guide institutional investors on votes, as well as shareholders from the Nordic countries, where Tesla has clashed with workers over labor rights. Norway’s trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund has said it will vote against the pay deal, as will the country’s largest pension fund, KLP. “While we acknowledge that the company has grown significantly and successfully during the performance period, we still note that the total award value remains excessive,” Kiran Aziz, KLP's head of responsible investments, told WIRED, adding the fund will vote in favor of the motion urging Tesla to engage in labor negotiations. “Recent [dispute] between Tesla and the company’s workers in Sweden as well as Tesla’s history of accusations of interference with workers’ rights is of great concern and shows that the company needs to do better work in the area.” Behind the scenes of the vote, lobbying has been intense. Tesla has paid for ads on Google and X, which is owned by Musk, telling investors to “protect your investment” and support the proposal, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In April, Tesla also launched a website urging shareholders to vote against the Delaware court decision and support the pay package. “The Court’s decision, if implemented, means that Elon would not receive any compensation for the tremendous accomplishments that have generated significant stockholder returns in less than six years,” the website reads. “This is the most advertising I can remember from any proxy solicitation,” says Robert Anderson, a professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law. He believes the Musk effect—the CEO’s ability to attract endless publicity—has contributed to this situation. But the pay package and the proposed Texas move are both unprecedented in the business world, he adds. “Either [of] those things by themselves would be pretty significant, even if he were not a public figure.” The vote will be decided by a mix of institutional investors as well as an unusually large cohort of retail investors, who control around 44 percent of the business. Among shareholders, there are concerns that if Musk does not win his compensation, “his attention might drift to some of his other ventures a little bit more,” says Anderson. Musk managed to juggle multiple ventures for years, but he has been more publicly distracted since acquiring the social media service Twitter and renaming it X. There, his visible turn to right-wing politics has garnered new fans and left some old ones behind. Whatever happens this week, Tesla and Musk may emerge looking a bit less superhuman. For years, the two have insisted that Tesla is a tech company, with a Silicon Valley–style startup scrappiness. “We should be thought of as an AI or robotics company,” Musk told investors—or voters—in April. “If you value Tesla as just an auto company … fundamentally, it’s just the wrong framework.”"
41,Scott Gilbertson,"How to Choose a Camera (2024): Sensors, Megapixels, Terms",https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-choose-a-camera/,"Shopping for a camera can be confusing. Here’s how to sift through the acronyms, sensor options, and extra features to find the best one for you.",2024-06-12T12:00:00Z,"Scott Gilbertson The first thing to know about buying a digital camera in 2024 is that it's virtually impossible to buy a bad one. You probably have a great camera in your hand right now. For many people, a smartphone will be camera enough, but if you want a camera separate from your phone, read on. The current crop of digital cameras is almost universally fantastic. Everything on the market is capable of capturing great images, provided you learn how to use your camera and understand the basics of photography: composition, light, and timing. That said, you don't want a technically good camera—you want the right camera for you. The right camera for you depends on what you want to photograph, how you want to use it, where you're going to shoot, and a myriad of other questions that only you can answer. To help you out, I'll walk through the basics of every major component of a camera you'll want to know about, breaking down jargon and explaining things on a practical level.

The first step in finding the best camera for you is knowing what you want to do with it, at least somewhat. For example, if you know you're going to be taking pictures of your kids' sports games, you'll want to pay special attention to how good the autofocus is, and how fast it can capture images (measured in frames per second, or fps). If you know you're going to also want to make videos, make sure you get something with high-quality video features, like 4K 100 fps for slow motion content and something to eliminate or minimize rolling shutter. If you love astrophotography, you'll want to pay special attention to how noisy a sensor might be. While every camera made today is capable of great images, some are better than others at certain niche tasks like the examples above. Knowing the type of images you want to create will help you narrow down your search. If you're new to photography and don't know what you're going to end up liking, that's okay—don't worry about high-end niche features like superfast autofocus. Focus instead on entry-level cameras designed for the generalist, which will save you some money as well. Put that money into high-quality lenses. If you want to step up from a camera phone, I'd suggest skipping over point-and-shoot cameras and going to an interchangeable lens system. The reason is that most point-and-shoot cameras are only moderately better than a phone. Some aren't even as good as your phone. You do get a zoom lens in many cases, which is a step up, but it's not much of a step, especially for the price. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano If you're going to invest in a new system, I suggest you invest in something that can grow with you by allowing you to add different lenses down the road. Those lenses are the real investment, the things you keep even if you upgrade your camera body. That said, point-and-shoot cameras do have one advantage: size. They're compact and lightweight. The one point-and-shoot I own is the Fujifilm X70, and I own it because it fits in just about any pocket (it also has an APS-C sensor, which is huge for the size of the camera; more on sensors below). It's not my main camera (that's an interchangeable lens camera), but when I'm headed to a place where it would be awkward to carry a larger camera, the X70 is nice to have. Should you go with a mirrorless camera or a traditional DSLR? The difference is in the name. Digital Single-Lens Reflex cameras have a mirror, just like film cameras. When you look through the viewfinder you see the scene reflected through the mirror. When you press the shutter button, the mirror lifts up and the sensor behind it records the image. Mirrorless cameras lack the mirror, which means when you look through the electronic viewfinder, you are looking at a tiny LCD screen, which is showing you a live videofeed. This has several advantages, including the ability to magnify your view with a touch of a button and preview how the image will look at your chosen exposure settings, as well as much better autofocus when shooting video. Mirrorless cameras are also lighter and smaller. Most people would be best served by a mirrorless camera. The exception would be if you have a lot of lenses that will work with only a DSLR. If you've spent thousands on lenses designed for a DSLR, then by all means, stick with DSLR. If you're not already invested in a system, then get a mirrorless camera. Read our Best Mirrorless Cameras guide for recommendations. I have never heard professional photographers talk about their sensor, or their gear at all actually, but this is the internet photographer's favorite topic. This is also the one that matters the least in making great images. That said, let's dive in. There are many, many different sensors out there, ranging from the tiny one in your phone to the massive medium format sensors found in Fujifilm's GFX 100II or Hasselblad's 907X (8/10, WIRED Recommends). By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano To keep things simple, we'll ignore 1-inch and smaller sensors, which tend to be in only point-and-shoot cameras, action cameras, and phones. That leaves us with four basic sensor sizes to choose from: By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano You would think that the larger the sensor the better the images, right? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. The sensor specs ultimately have very little bearing on the quality of your images, but here are a few things sensor size does affect. The larger the sensor, the shallower the depth of field at the same aperture. That is, to get the same depth of field in an APS-C sensor as a 50-mm full-frame camera produces at f/2, you'd have to shoot at f/1.4. The same depth of field in Micro Four Thirds would require a lens capable of f/1. Alternately you could increase the focal length of the lens to create greater depth of field. In general though, the larger the sensor, the easier it is to achieve greater depth of field. What does all this mean in terms of making actual images? If you're the sort that loves the shallow depth of field images with nice falloff (bokeh, the kids call it), then a full-frame sensor is your best bet, and Micro Four Thirds is going to be the most challenging to produce the same look. Takeaway: Want massive depth of field or the bokeh effect? Get full frame. The larger the sensor, the less noise or digital artifacts you'll see in images. This is particularly true in low-light situations, where full-frame sensors are a much better option than anything smaller. Larger sensors can gather more light and tend to have smaller pixels, which will result in lower apparent noise. This also tends to give larger sensors like full frame and medium format a higher dynamic range. This means that the range of tones from the lightest to the darkest is wider and therefore you get more details in shadows and highlights. This is not a hard and fast rule, and the difference isn't always very noticeable. Side by side, I can see very little difference between the 40-MP RAW files from Fujifilm's XT-5 (APS-C) and my own Sony A7RII (full frame), for instance, but put a RAW file from the Hasselblad next to one from the Olympus Pen F and you can tell the difference. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Takeaway: Shooting a lot in low light? Get at least APS-C. Full frame is better. Bigger sensors mean bigger cameras. This isn't universally true, but most of the time, the smaller the sensor, the smaller the camera. The exceptions are some of the videocentric Panasonic GH cameras, which are sometimes larger than full-frame cameras because of the video processing that's happening behind the scenes. Most of the time though, if you're looking for a camera that's lightweight and maybe even fits in your pocket, Micro Four Thirds is your friend. This also applies to lenses. Because the sensor is smaller, the lens can be smaller and often lighter. Panasonic's Micro Four Thirds pancake lenses are tiny, weigh almost nothing, and in the case of my favorite, the 20-mm f/1.7, still have that semimagical quality that's rare in any format. Takeaway: Want a lightweight rig? Micro Four Thirds is better. This is a term you'll probably run across. The crop factor is how much of the outer edge of the image you lose relative to a full-frame 35-mm sensor viewing the same scene. The name comes from the fact that you're effectively cutting in, or ""cropping,"" the full-frame view of the same scene. The math is done in terms of the sensor's diagonal size, again relative to a full-frame sensor. So a crop factor of 1.4, which is APS-C, means that what you see through a 50-mm lens on an APS-C camera is a 1.4 smaller field of view than what you'd see through a 50-mm lens on a full frame. What does this mean in terms of making actual images? Nothing. The main thing it affects is the focal length for lenses to get the same field of view as if shooting in 35 mm. For instance, if you get a Fujifilm X-T5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and want the field of view you're used to from 35-mm film, you would want something like the Fujinon XF35mm f/1.4 lens because 35 X 1.4 = 50 mm. If you end up with a Micro Four Thirds camera and want the same field of view, you'd want a 25-mm lens (25 X 2 = 50 mm). Beyond that, there are too many other factors to consider, which is to say that the sensor size alone doesn't determine the image quality. In the end, it's not that sensor size doesn't matter; it's that there are too many other factors to make your decision based on this alone. For a long time, the megapixel count was a favorite marketing term of camera makers. Then the manufacturers began to hit the upper limits of megapixels for each size sensor and started to focus on other things like low-light noise performance, autofocus speed, computational photography improvements, and so on. Megapixels have largely fallen by the wayside. Here's a good rule of thumb to help—aim for roughly these megapixel counts by sensor size: By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The other thing to keep in mind with megapixels is that the more you have, the larger the file size of your image. The 20-MP Micro Four Thirds sensor I suggest above produces RAW files around 20 MB in size. The 24-MP APS-C sensor produces files about 56 MB in size. Curiously though, the 42-MP full-frame sensor in my Sony averages around 40-MB images, so file size to megapixel count is not necessarily linear. Some cameras can also store their RAW files in compressed formats, which helps save some space. Either way, you might want to consider picking up a spare external hard drive. Ergonomics and camera design matters, not just because we all want a cool-looking camera, but because how well organized your camera is directly translates to how easy it is to shoot with, which in turn can dictate whether you get the shot you were after. I happen to like what some people call retro designs, which have most controls as part of the camera body—manual controls with physical dials and knobs. My favorite camera of all the ones I've tested recently is the Nikon Zf (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which borrows the aesthetic of a film camera, making it possible to control just about every feature without ever once using the screen. Other people love a touchscreen with a well-organized menu system, which means they never need to fiddle with a dial. Fortunately, there are cameras for both of us. Here are other features to consider when buying a new camera: You aren't just buying a camera when you buy a camera; you're also buying into a lens system. You can't put a Canon lens on a Nikon body, which means when you buy that Nikon body you're effectively turning your back on every other brand of lens. That's not a bad thing, and there is no right ecosystem to buy into, but it's important to understand that that's part of the decision. These days, with very little difference between top-end cameras across brands, lenses are an important, if not more important, part of your decision. If you know that you want to shoot a lot of night-sky shots and you have your eye on the Samyang XP 14-mm f/2.4—one of the best, reasonably-priced astro lenses available—then you also know you'll want to buy either a Canon or Nikon mirrorless camera since the Samyang is made for those mounts only. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano But which lenses do you need? Cameras are often sold with what's known as a “kit lens.” These lenses tend to be lower quality, but are also a cheap way to get started. Most kit lenses are zoom lenses spanning the 35-mm to 80-mm range. I recommend beginners start with a kit lens if there's one available for the camera you've got your eye on. After you've shot with the kit lens for a while, you'll have a better feel for which focal lengths you like. Lenses are generally divided into three basic categories: wide-angle lenses (anything from 12 mm up to 35 mm), “normal” lenses (anything from about 40 mm to 65 mm), and telephoto lenses (anything longer than 80 mm). There are also two types of lenses: zoom lenses, where the focal length changes, and prime lenses, where the focal length is fixed. Both have their place. Zooms offer more versatility, but usually have a larger f-stop, making them have less depth of field and worse low-light performance. Prime lenses are faster, meaning you can shoot wide open for that sweet, sweet bokeh, but are less versatile. I should note that technically, you can adapt lenses from one manufacturer to another, but you often lose autofocus or spend considerable sums on expensive adapters, and the experience of using a Canon lens on a Nikon body isn't nearly as nice as a native lens. When you've made your camera decision, don't forget to protect your new investment. We have a guide to our favorite camera bags and straps, but whatever you do, get some padding around your new baby. You'll also want to pick up a memory card. These days that usually means an SD card or CFexpress card, whichever your camera uses. How fast of a card do you need? We have a whole guide to answer that question. I like these Lexar SD Cards and have been using them for about a decade now. For CFexpress, we like Sony's cards. If you made it this far, hopefully you've come to some kind of decision about your ideal camera. Buy it, learn to use it, and then stop reading articles like this. It's not the camera that matters. No one cares what laptop I wrote this on, but for some reason, everyone cares which camera you're using. Forget all that now that you have the best camera for you. Go shoot with your new camera. Make images. Make good images. Make bad images. Learn from both, make better images, and keep shooting. Look at photo books by the masters of the form, spend your time on the three keys to great photographs—light, composition, and timing—and don't worry so much about the gear."

For better or worse, most modern dads don’t get hung up on presents. You know the meme of the older, bearded gentleman with a goofy smile opening a shirt just like the one he has on? There’s a lot of truth to that meme. However, I am not only a dad and a gear reviewer but also someone with a specific philosophy about what makes a good gift for middle-aged men like me. You’ll notice some threads running through this manifesto guide: The best gifts for a dad are things that not only are relevant to his interests but also can be fairly described as “overkill.” Dads tend to like things that are overbuilt but useful. I’m sure some dads want to be “pampered,” but this is not me or the dads I know, who all physically cringed reading this sentence. If you take away one idea, I hope it’s that when it comes to a gift for a dad, you can rarely go wrong by giving an expensive but excellent version of a thing we use anyway. We especially like things that win the admiration of our peers—nothing makes a dad happier than having another dad-aged dude take note of his stupidly expensive tire pressure gauge and then saying, “Oh, yeah, my kid got me that—they’re a little pricey but I gotta say, always works great.” Check out the rest of our gift guides, including Gifts for Moms, Tech Gifts for Kids, and Gifts for Outdoorsy People.

Dads are somewhat famously the grown-up version of rambunctious boys, which is why an extremely powerful and expensive squirt gun is a great gift idea. I was introduced to the Spyra through a trend story WIRED ran last year and have since purchased two Spyra LXes for backyard fun with my daughter. Is $64 too much to pay for a water gun? Why would you even ask when the high-end electric SpyraThree costs almost three times that much? This gun shoots blasts of water so powerful and accurate that you can use it to knock down a row of pop cans at 40 feet. Fair warning that the “maximum depth” line for refilling is not a gentle caution but an urgent warning and that ignoring it could damage your gun—one of my Spyra LXes leaks badly because I dunked the whole front half of the gun into the water several times while filling and put too much pressure on the internal components while pumping it full. The electric version will load itself, eliminating all that hassle, but $179 is too rich for my blood. If your dad plays sports or is frequently at the gym, he may like a Theragun for muscle recovery. The Sense is moderately priced for the company but includes four attachments and an LCD screen for walking through guided routines. A heart-rate sensor on the handle works in conjunction with breathwork sessions for total body relaxation. The Sense is also whisper-quiet. If Dad is a serious athlete, the Theragun Pro Plus is more powerful with additional attachments, including a vibrating one for massaging sensitive muscles, and near-infrared LED light therapy for further promoting circulation and recovery. However, it’s double the price. —Medea Giordano I tend to forget aprons exist until my shirt is covered with flour and/or barbecue sauce, which may be why I keep getting aprons as gifts. I have been gifted at least four novelty aprons in my nearly nine years of fatherhood. The problem with the other aprons I've received is that, while they did have dad jokes printed on them, the thin cotton didn’t do a lot to prevent seepage to my shirt. This waxed cotton apron from Hedley & Bennett solves for that. This is an apron you’ll find in professional kitchens. We've got a coupon for free shipping over $125 (some of the aprons alone are above this price) on our WIRED coupons site. I’ve sat on a lot of camp chairs in my lifetime. Maybe this is my Archie Bunker moment, but there is only one camp chair I have strong positive feelings about, and this is it. The Nemo Stargaze is as much a hybrid hammock as it is a chair, with a seat that swings between the heavy-duty aluminum support posts. As the name implies, it reclines by adjusting a bevy of nylon straps so that Dad can lean his head back on the integrated pillow and stare up at the starry night sky (or fall asleep with a flask by the fire). Thanks to a low center of gravity it’s easy to get into and out of, and you never worry about tipping over on sand or loose gravel. A new wallet is one of those most classic of gifts for dads, right along with socks or neckties. As one of those men who once put my spine out of alignment by sitting on a fat wallet (thanks to various loyalty and membership cards, not wads of cash), I’ve long been curious about a MagSafe wallet that attaches to my phone and holds only a few cards. My fellow WIRED reviewers generally love Satechi accessories (for iPads, for Macbooks, for charging), so this one was a no-brainer. Ultimately, I used it for two weeks before switching back to a regular wallet—but that’s a me problem, not a reflection of this excellent wallet sleeve and stand, which performed quite well with a powerful magnetic connection and vegan leather that both felt like regular leather and wore even more gracefully. In the end, I simply could not get over my traditional “wallet, keys, phone” pocket check. For whatever reason, dads like paying attention to the weather. The discussion goes beyond “really needing” that recent rain and digs into useless precision. That’s why they’ll love the Ambient Weather ecosystem recommended by WIRED senior editor Parker Hall. It lets you know everything from daily rainfall to the current UV index via several weather-measuring doohickeys, accessories, and screens. The Ambient Weather WS-2902 includes a rain collector and two instruments to measure wind, but it's just one of many tools that can be combined. Building this system out will cover you on gift ideas for at least two to three gifting occasions. Even better, Ambient Weather keeps releasing new products. This is a boon for hard-to-shop-for fathers or nerdy types everywhere. Hall’s dad got his first Ambient Weather device in December, has now installed others in two locations, and is considering adding a third at the family vacation home. The rest of the Hall family is set on gifting ideas for years. Maybe your dad loves fried foods, but his doctor doesn’t. Maybe he’s already a convert to air frying but is using a device that has seen better days. Either way, he’s going to be impressed with the Typhur Dome, a sleek, modern air fryer I have been testing on wings, pierogi, and frozen french fries over the past month. The Typhur is more squat than most air fryers, which is part of a design that maximizes both the space of the nonstick cooking surface and airflow, speeding up the cooking process. Wings take 14 minutes, 16 if you prefer them “fried hard” like I do. The Typhur also has a self-cleaning mode, though I use soap and water on the basket. Another nice feature, common to some other air fryers but not all, is the dehydration mode—I’ve yet to test it, but I’m making jerky soon, and your dad might also enjoy drying and spicing his beef to avoid the preservatives you get in gas station jerky. As silly as it may sound, I have been on the hunt for the best pepper grinder for about two years. Männkitchen’s Pepper Cannon ended that search. This (admittedly expensive) anodized aluminum grinder is sturdy enough to pound a nail into a wall, and it has a finely tuned grinder mechanism that efficiently and precisely crushes peppercorns at more than 50 different mesh sizes. I’ve been working to find the perfect grind for the pepper portion of the rub on my smoked ribs and found it at about 12 clicks from the coarsest setting on this grinder. Well-calibrated gears and burrs made from high-carbon stainless steel make it easy to smoothly power through a pile of peppercorns, and the integrated cup on the bottom stores the pepper until you're ready to apply it. If your dad is a home cook who’s making lots of barbecue or steak, this grinder will up his game. You may have noticed that ""professional grade"" is a powerful marketing term in the Dudeosphere. Even men in white-collar fields want to drive the same truck the guy who hung their drywall drives (which seems to be the entire marketing philosophy behind trucks). The Robot Coupe is along those same lines. This brand of French food processor is ubiquitous in professional kitchens and coveted by people who want that same performance at home. If you’re looking to julienne carrots and cucumbers for salad rolls or whip up a big batch of buttery-smooth hummus, you’re not going to get there with a food processor from Target. The Robot Coupe takes up about as much room as a KitchenAid mixer but is sturdy with sharp steel blades designed to keep their edge for years. The motor’s power is measured in horsepower. I bought mine used from a man who sold it because his wife said it took up too much space. When I asked him what he liked to make with it, he got a faraway look in his eye. It was understood that the appeal of the device extends beyond the practical; you want a Robot Coupe because it’s what the pros use. When I posted a picture of it to my Instagram, multiple dads messaged me to express envy or support. Your dad could be that dad. I recently injured my left knee … cleaning. Yes, that’s what happens when you’re dad age. It was an extremely large and ambitious cleaning project but, nevertheless, the injury left me feeling very old indeed. That knee injury has lingered for 11 months and only improved significantly in the two months since I got this miracle device from Hydragun. The Heatpulse straps directly onto your knee and is powered by a rechargeable pack that connects via USB-C. It heats up to a maximum setting of 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) and has various massage speed settings. I just crank both up to the top and let it go until it shuts off and this is probably what your dad will do, too. The Heatpulse has made a marked difference in how good my knee feels. There are many good cheap infrared thermometers other than this ThermoWorks model. Your dad probably doesn’t need the nearly 1,500 degrees of range and wide targeting laser with eight measurement points to grill burgers. But, having received this tool as a Christmas gift, and having subsequently used it to make many backyard pizzas and smoked meats, I can confirm that it makes for a great gift. Having a wider circle to read from makes the results much more reliable than the cheaper temp guns. It’s rugged too. I’ve dropped it a few times without any issues. Though mainly used for culinary applications, this is a serious tool that will come in handy if your dad is trying to track down a leak in the attic insulation that’s causing him to burn up a brontosaurus every damned day. The martyrdom of Harambe gets most of the blame for plunging us into this dark timeline, but if you ask me to point to the start of our recent troubles, I’ll instead look to the decision by Major League Baseball to move away from traditional wool baseball caps and toward the cheap polyester things you see today. We’re huge fans of wool around here, and the benefits of natural fiber are even more noticeable on a baseball hat than a T-shirt–wool caps are breathable so they stay cooler in the summer heat, are far less smelly, and stretch a bit as you break them in. The decline continues this season as MLB sold out on uniforms and has players wearing cheapo on-field jerseys they hate. It’s increasingly tough to find and purchase wool caps, but I recently found Hat Haven, where I scored a wool 1920 Cleveland Indians hat. Search up your dad’s favorite ball club and buy with confidence, as this is a gift he’ll love. I’ve been a fan of American Giant hoodies since a friend steered me toward this 2012 Slate article about the brand, which was then a unique upstart in direct-to-consumer American-made clothing. I could not have imagined back then that I’d wear the hoodie for the better part of the following decade (I lived in Portland, where 300 days of the year is hoodie weather) or that my Instagram feed (the app with the olde tymey photo filters) would one day be filled with very similar casual clothing brands. So it didn’t take much arm twisting to get me to test the brand’s newer Los Angeles–made lightweight hoodie, which has the same sturdy feel without the bulk or warmth. This cotton-poly-rayon blend has a forgiving fit and just the right amount of softness without feeling like pajamas. If your dad is a hoodie guy, this is a perfect gift. I’m spending Father’s Day at Virginia Beach; it’s going to be sunny and 85. That’s why I bought every single father in my life—my dad, my father-in-law, my husband—a different pattern of Roark’s breathable stretch shirt. It’s made from Tactel fabric, which is a combination of cotton and polyamide that gives it the hand feel and drape of natural fibers, but the stretchy, moisture-wicking breathability of synthetics. The short-sleeved, button-up camp shirt style is appropriate for everything from a beach cover-up to a casual dinner out. It also comes in a wide variety of fun patterns and bright colors so they don’t all look the same. However, I believe that men all like to wear the same shirt! It's a thing. I wish it came in women's sizes too. —Adrienne So At some point in the near future, we may be bringing you a full guide (or two) to adventure pants, which we define as those pants you see advertised on Instagram for people who climb fourteeners, vacation in Papua New Guinea, and/or drink IPA on brewery patios with their dogs. These stellar pants from Duer will be in the mix on that guide. The publicist who pitched me called Duer “the ultimate dad brand,” and I was skeptical (publicists have been known to occasionally promote their client's interest even when they have to stretch the truth!), but, wow, they really are. They’re made with stretchy plant-based Lyocell fiber instead of spandex and stay cool in the heat while also giving full flexibility—too often you sacrifice breathability for stretchiness, but not here. Fellow dads will agree these are what you wear to see Wilco on a summer tour when you’ve got lawn seats and don’t want to have bare skin on the grass. I wore them to my daughter’s swim meet on an 80-plus-degree day and remained very comfortable. Last summer I had what I can only describe as a harrowing moment in fatherhood: I couldn’t find my keys while on a road trip with my 8-year-old daughter 500 miles from home. It turns out I had a hole in the pocket of my shorts (dads are always wearing old clothing past the failure point), and to make it a true nightmare, I’d just been walking for a few miles on a path along the Mississippi River. I got lucky and found my keys in the parking lot. I immediately bought an AirTag and a keychain holder for it. Dads often feel deep personal responsibility and shame connected to things like losing their keys. A set of AirTags will help assuage that anxiety, plus allow him to low-key LoJack his bike or a vehicle (your dad knows what this means) and maybe even something like his tackle box. WIRED recently published a guide to the best barbecue and hot sauce subscriptions, and that sounds like a real nice gift for a dad. Real nice. No offense to Andrew, the Angeleno who wrote that guide, but I live in Kansas City, a town that's synonymous with sauce, and ’round here we pretty much all agree the best barbecue sauce that has or ever will exist comes from Gates. To the extent any local folk disagree, they're probably from Johnson County and have opinions to be heard and considered (but not too carefully). Gates Original has the perfect balance of sweetness, smoke, and richness. Gates sauce is great on anything and everything, especially french fries—which always come with barbecue in Kansas City. I'm not from here originally, so don't ask me why. I think a couple of bottles of Gates would make an excellent last-minute gift this Father's Day. If you did want to opt for the sauce subscription at this late date, you can also order this and attach a note about the coming subscription so your dad will be able to enjoy a bottle of Gates on his special day and then a bunch of slightly lesser sauces throughout the year. Your dad probably drinks coffee. He probably likes it when that coffee is delicious. If he likes variety—I’m an extremist on this and rarely buy the same bag twice—he’ll love a subscription to Atlas Coffee Club, which ships beans from all over the world in every style of roast and grind you can imagine. I am especially fond of the half-bag batches, which means I’m getting new flavors midway through the week. If there’s one thing most dads agree on, it’s the appeal of beating a system designed to swindle them. Thus the appeal of a maximum allowable carry-on bag. Airlines are always trying to chisel you, and this bag by Tom Bihn grants you every last square inch of promised space in the overhead bins on a typical domestic carrier. But this Seattle-made bag does a lot more than max out your free luggage allotment; it’s also made of incredibly sturdy 1,050-denier ballistic nylon with bombproof YKK zippers. It has hidden backpack straps and the most comfortable cross-body strap I’ve ever used. This is a bag that excels at being tossed around and lugged down rough streets and through crowds where roller bags are a liability. I own two of these and have had the first one for more than a decade. I don’t fly without it and neither will your pops. Designed in partnership with Scottish master distiller Jim McEwan, this double-walled whiskey glass is made to bring out aromatics and alleviate ethanol burn. WIRED reviewer Parker Hall (a new dad himself) has used this borosilicate glass many times with bourbon, Scotch, rye, and other whiskeys of the world. It's a cool drinking experience, with the gorgeous inner glass meeting the outside at a perfect drip-free edge for easy sips. Hall still uses a regular tumbler for basic pours on the rocks, but when he's drinking any high-end spirit that should be sipped neat, this is his go-to drinkware. Don't just take it from him: It's won numerous design awards and sold a half-million units since its release. I’m working on a new guide to flashlights and have more to test, but so far, this is the clear standout. The T4R is a mid-sized but heavy-duty rechargeable 1,220-lumen light that’s crushproof, water resistant, and built to military spec. It’s a pocket-sized spotlight. The beam goes about 3,000 yards, meaning you could shine it across the Golden Gate Bridge. It comes with a charging cradle and adapters for charging in your car and overseas. I don’t think I needed this flashlight to take my daughter trick-or-treating, but I wasn’t sad about it. Your dad won’t be either. Yes, there are only two dozen items on this list and two are extravagantly expensive forms of lighting. Trust me, this is what dads want. We like seeing stuff at night. The Skylight is a new device from Goal Zero, makers of some of our favorite portable power stations, which can light an entire backyard, garage, or campsite. It has six adjustable LED panels putting out 6,000 lumens attached to a retractable pole that will soar up to 12 feet high to give you coverage for a 300-foot area. It’s all rated for IPX4 water resistance so you can leave it outside all night without worry. I’ve used it in the basement where it illuminated corners I forgot existed, and in my backyard where it allowed me to grill into the evening without a headlamp. Finding new uses for it is half the fun of owning it. I've been dreaming of owning a Malm Zircon fireplace for years, but they’re out of my price range and incompatible with my chimney-less home. This smokeless pit by Terraflame, a sub-brand of Solo Stove, fits the bill. The Lloyd’s cone-shaped silhouette echoes the midcentury modern design of the Malm, but instead of logs and a flue you get space for three gel canisters that provide 6-inch flames with a soft crackle—it’s enough to feel like a real flame but without any smoke or soot. The Lloyd is light enough to move around (I have it against a wall in my living room), and it’ll look great in the corner of a man cave, den, or basement. A smokeless fire pit offers your dad the perfect excuse to kick back with a glass of whiskey or wine and watch the flames dance, and this one looks good when it’s not lit too. Just as I doubled down on expensive lighting, I'm doubling down on firepits. Take it from a dad: Fire pits are what dads want for gifts. I'm currently testing this Breeo against a Solo Stove for our forthcoming guide to the best fire pits, and it has the early edge, mostly because of the beautiful patina it has developed in the past month thanks to my efforts to age the corten steel by applying several coats of vinegar, salt, and hydrogen peroxide. My baby is nice and rusty now. Nice. And Rusty. Breeo's firepit is overbuilt (the 24-inch one weighs 62 pounds) and does a good job of being smokeless, though not quite as good as competitor Solo Stove. What I love best, however, is the complete suite of available accessories. I've tested the pizza oven and grill plate, which are both well-designed and highly functional. Mostly, though, I love that patina—gazing out upon my back patio, I feel the type of satisfaction a farmer must feel looking out across the dewy morning fields to see an old Chevy truck without tires gracefully rusting away by his barn. There are often so many errands I need to do around town that aren't worth the hassle of hopping in a car and wading through traffic—or dealing with public transit. That's why I love having an electric scooter around, ready to go. The Apollo Go 2024 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our new favorite escooter, with a handsome design, respectable range (around 16 miles in my testing), and nice perks like turn signals and a useful app. Get this for your city-slicker dad so he can make quick trips around town without having to lose his parking spot (if he doesn't have the luxury of a garage). —Julian Chokkattu Christopher Solomon Andrew Williams Adrienne So Medea Giordano Adrienne So Tim Barber Julian Chokkattu Louryn Strampe Extra 20% Off Select Dyson Technology With Owner Rewards GoPro Promo Code: 15% Off When You Sign Up Get Up To An Extra 45% Off May Secret Sale 5% Off Everything With Dell Coupon Code Vista Print Coupon Code: 20% Off Select Signage Newegg Coupon 10% Off"
43,Jared Keller,Let Slip the Robot Dogs of War,https://www.wired.com/story/let-slip-the-robot-dogs-of-war/,The United States and China appear locked in a race to weaponize four-legged robots for military applications.,2024-06-16T09:00:00Z,"Jared Keller The Chinese military recently unveiled a new kind of battle buddy for its soldiers: a “robot dog” with a machine gun strapped to its back. In video distributed by the state-run news agency CCTV, People's Liberation Army personnel are shown operating on a testing range alongside a four-legged robot with what appears to be a variant of the standard-issue 5.8 x 42-mm QBZ-95 assault rifle mounted on it as part of China’s recent Golden Dragon 24 joint military exercises with Cambodia in the Gulf of Thailand. In one scenario, Chinese soldiers stand on either side of a doorway while the robot dog enters the building ahead of them; in another, the robot fires off a burst of bullets as it advances on a target. “It can serve as a new member in our urban combat operations, replacing our members to conduct reconnaissance and identify enemy [sic] and strike the target during our training,” one Chinese soldier shown operating the robot told CCTV. This isn’t the first time the Chinese military-industrial complex has shown off an armed robot dog. In October 2022, Chinese defense company Kestrel Defense published a video showing an unmanned aerial vehicle air-dropping a quadrupedal ground vehicle affixed with a 5.8 x 42-mm QBB-97 light machine gun on a roof during an urban warfare experiment. The company had previously released footage of robot dogs outfitted with combat systems that included everything from smoke grenades to loitering munitions. And as recently as this March, Chinese researchers claimed that tests involving robot dogs outfitted with an unidentified 7.62-mm rifle (likely a variant of the Type 56 assault rifle that’s based on the ubiquitous Soviet-made AK-47) yielded marksmanship that rivaled trained Chinese sharpshooters, according to the South China Morning Post. China’s demonstration clearly rankled international observers, prompting at least one American lawmaker to call on the US Defense Department for a report on “rifle-toting robot dogs” and their potential national security implications. But if the Chinese military is pioneering the weaponization of robot dogs, then the United States military isn’t far behind. In the past year, the Pentagon has experimented with outfitting quadrupedal ground robots with its standard-issue 5.56 x 45-mm M4A1 carbine, the 6.8-mm XM7 rifle that the US Army is in the process of adopting under its Next Generation Squad Weapon program, and even the M72 Light Anti-Tank Weapon that’s been in service with American troops since the Vietnam War. Just weeks before CCTV published its footage of armed robot dogs in action, Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) revealed that it was experimenting with adding mounted gun systems based on defense contractor Onyx’s artificial intelligence-enabled SENTRY remote weapons system to its own mechanized canines. American defense officials have been quick to emphasize that the development of weaponized robot dogs is, at this stage, purely experimental, intended to help military planners “explore the realm of the possible” when it comes to the potential applications of revolutionary robotic systems in a future conflict, as one Army official put it last August. But with Army soldiers conducting urban assault drills alongside robot dogs and the Marine Corps increasingly eyeing mechanical quadrupeds to augment future formations with “intelligent robotics,” it may not be too long before the US military is forced to seriously consider adopting armed robot canines for combat before China does. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “Why are we acting surprised by this? It was so obviously coming,” Peter W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based think tank New America and expert on advanced military technology, tells WIRED. “The first wheeled and tracked [explosive ordnance disposal] robots had cameras on them to inspect roadside bombs, then someone added guns to them; the same thing with the Predator drone, which started out unarmed until the military strapped missiles to it. Armed robotics has been a trendline for years.” Quadrupedal robots aren’t a new development in the annals of military technology. In 2005, robotics leader Boston Dynamics unveiled BigDog, a four-legged mechanical “pack mule” that was intended to haul weapons and supplies for US troops over terrain considered unwelcoming to traditional wheeled or tracked ground vehicles. Funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and adopted as the Legged Squad Support System by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, BigDog was eventually deemed too loud for practical use and discontinued after a decade and more than $40 million invested in the much-hyped project. Despite BigDog’s shortcomings, the underlying research behind the system eventually gave rise to Spot, a smaller and quieter “robot dog” that Boston Dynamics debuted in 2015. While too small to lug around gear and weapons, the system immediately had clear military applications for everything from base perimeter security to remote site inspection. In the years since its introduction, Spot has proven the platform-defining vision of quadrupedal ground robots, inspiring both collaborators like Asylon Robotics’ DroneDog and alleged imitators like Ghost Robotics’ Vision 60 to compete for a slice of the Defense Department’s growing robotics budget. Based on publicly available media in Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), the Pentagon’s media distribution hub, the adoption of robot dogs across the US military didn’t start in earnest until 2020, when the Air Force integrated a handful of Ghost Robotics systems into what’s called an “agile combat employment” exercise at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, which saw airmen work with their new best friends to secure an airfield against a simulated attack. Just a few months later, officials at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida became the first US military installation in the world to incorporate the semiautonomous robot dogs into its base security regimen. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “These dogs will be an extra set of eyes and ears while computing large amounts of data at strategic locations throughout Tyndall Air Force Base,” Major Jordan Criss, 325th Security Forces Squadron commander, said of the systems during initial testing in late 2020. “They will be a huge enhancement for our defenders and allow flexibility in the posting and response of our personnel.” In the intervening years, robot dogs have become an increasingly common fixture across the US military, beyond patrolling sensitive installations. In July 2023, Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota introduced robot dogs to enable airmen to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats “without risking the safety of themselves or others.” In August, Patrick Space Force Base in Florida added robot dogs to its perimeter security rotation for an “additional detection and alert capability.” That same month, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Philadelphia Division, announced the employment of robot dogs to “build 3-D ship models aboard the ‘mothballed’ fleet of decommissioned ships at the Philadelphia Navy Yard,” while the Coast Guard unveiled four-legged “droid” dogs in Hawaii to “combat weapons of mass destruction.” Finally, in November, airmen at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana debuted robot dogs for explosive ordnance disposal. Despite these practical noncombat applications, some robotics companies have had an eye on weaponization. In October 2021, Ghost Robotics showed off a so-called “Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle,” or SPUR, quadrupedal robot with an 6.5-mm Creedmoor assault rifle developed by SWORD International mounted on its back during an annual Army weapons expo in Washington, DC, in the first public example of a robot dog armed with a firearm. The following year, a video of a robot dog outfitted with a PP-19 Vityaz submachine gun by Russian entrepreneur Alexander Atamov quickly went viral on YouTube and Twitter. By 2023, an American company had debuted a robot dog with a flamethrower strapped to its back, albeit not explicitly for military use (no longer fielded to US soldiers, using flamethrowers against enemy combatants is technically not prohibited). Like the Predator drone, you can’t build a new robot without someone slapping a weapon on it. The public reception to weaponized robot dogs is overwhelmingly defined by concern mixed with discomfort, especially given the rise of autonomous or semiautonomous weapon systems that can independently track and identify targets. Even beyond the conventional invocation of Terminator-inspired techno-anxiety, the robot dogs appear eerily reminiscent of the menacing mechanized canines of Black Mirror. Part of the creep factor stems from the “uncanny valley,” says Singer, invoking the psychological phenomenon in which robots that look and act almost-but-not-quite natural end up unnerving their human observers. “On the engineering side, these robots take inspiration from nature, since real dogs are, through evolution, designed to operate really well in the field,” Singer says. “As a result, we layer our beliefs about these types of creatures on top of ‘bioinspired’ robots, and the more something acts lifelike but not likelike, the more we react with fear or disgust.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Such anxiety over armed robot dogs even prompted six leading robotics companies—led by Spot pioneer Boston Dynamics—to release a letter in October 2022 promising to prohibit military customers from weaponizing their robots for combat purposes. (SPUR creator SWORD International was not a signatory.) “We believe that adding weapons to robots that are remotely or autonomously operated, widely available to the public, and capable of navigating to previously inaccessible locations where people live and work, raises new risks of harm and serious ethical issues,” the companies wrote. “Weaponized applications of these newly-capable robots will also harm public trust in the technology in ways that damage the tremendous benefits they will bring to society.” To be fair, both the US military and American robotics companies have urged caution when it comes to developing autonomous weapons systems. Upon unveiling the SPUR, late Ghost Robotics CEO Jiren Parikh emphasized that the armed robot always has an operator in the loop, with no AI or autonomy-related systems that could potentially falter under extreme circumstances. And while the SENTRY turret that MARSOC is reportedly testing affixed to a pair of robot dogs does use AI to scan for and identify targets, the company also emphasized that the decision to engage with the weapon system is completely reliant on a human operator. While the idea of armed robot dogs with minds of their own running amok may be a recent addition to Americans’ dystopian imagination, the US military-industrial complex appears firmly focused on keeping humans in control at all times. Despite understandable concerns over their growing role in military affairs, anxiety over packs of armed robot dogs operating on a future battlefield may be premature, according to Sam Bendett, an analyst at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses think tank whose research focuses on robotics and unmanned systems. While footage of armed robot dogs may alarm the average observer, these systems are currently nowhere near agile or versatile enough to make practical sense on chaotic battlefields. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “I had a chance to operate [a robot dog] at an AI conference in the Netherlands last year, and it doesn’t have the same dexterity you would expect from a quadruped,” Bendett tells WIRED. “It’s not quite as dexterous, as flexible, or as fast in how it operates. Apart from videos of them doing push-ups and shit like that, it doesn’t run, it can maybe jog, but it can’t even make a turn quite as fast as a tracked or wheeled unmanned ground vehicle.” “The battlefield is full of man-made and natural countermeasures,” he adds. “That doesn't mean the US and China won't try it out, but it’ll just be in a more limited capacity.” The Chinese military exercise spotlighted on CCTV may appear concerning, but it’s still a controlled exercise in a managed, relatively stable environment, Bendett says. Until robot dogs demonstrate that they can navigate “the debris of the battlefield” under less-than-ideal conditions, they’ll remain something of a mechanical novelty for military planners. “Yes, they’re neat, they’re cool,” Bendett says. “But show me a video of a pack of these moving on their own through a forest, not just walking by tapping their feet at every step but actually jogging between trees the way I would with a dog. Then we’ll get to the point where these are actual combat dogs.” It’s unclear what the future of robot dogs might look like in the ranks of the US military, or even the Chinese military. While they’ve certainly proved useful in augmenting base security and conducting hazardous operations like explosive ordnance disposal, their potential combat applications remain understandably ambiguous. But given American and Chinese military planners’ ongoing experiments with armed robot dogs, the future of warfare may involve not just the grind of tank treads and the roar of helicopter rotors, but the metallic patter of four-legged death across distant battlefields. Corrected: 6/16/2024, 7:24 EST: SPUR creator SWORD International is not a signatory to an open letter."

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 6/10 We like e-readers because they're easy on the eyes and relatively simple, with one use case: reading. The Nook, which is made by Barnes and Noble, has been a solid e-reader option since 2009, and the brand has released several traditional tablets along the way. This year, it updated its tablet made in collaboration with Lenovo. Though it's branded a Nook, it's not quite an e-reader. You can read on it—it comes with the Nook app loaded—but it's the 2024 version of the Tab M9 running Android 13, so it's a tablet first. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Given the relatively cheap $150 price, it means you or your kid can get a pretty decent tablet without spending hundreds. The 9-inch, 1,340 x 800 display is small enough that you could throw it in a purse, but you could still comfortably stream your favorite shows while traveling or walking on a treadmill. This isn't the most intense display you can find in a tablet, but I still watched clear YouTube videos at 1080p, and with Dolby Atmos, they sounded clear too. There's an actual headphone jack (hallelujah!), or you can connect Bluetooth headphones for listening to music or audiobooks. If you're set on seeing the richest colors and intense contrast, you probably want something better, but you're also probably not trying to find a tablet in this price range. It comes with 64 gigabytes of storage for all your books and apps, or you could add your own microSD card to expand it to 128 gigs. You'll get up to 13 hours of battery life, but expect a few hours less if you're mostly streaming video. While in the Nook app, you may want to turn on reading mode in either chromatic for color books to lower the color temperature or grayscale to make the screen black-and-white. But this is still an LCD screen, so it's not as easy on the eyes as a dedicated e-reader. One thing I don't like about the Nook app is that swiping through pages is similar to how you swipe to close out of an app, so I frequently found myself on the home screen instead of the next page. The tablet has a notification-free mode that you can set up for any apps you choose, and I would suggest adding the Nook app to that list. E-readers are nice because they're distraction-free, so turning off notifications helps get this focused feeling back.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED This Nook 9 tablet is comparable to Amazon's Fire tablets, which are the tablets that we typically recommend if you don't want to spend a lot. They're not the fastest nor the most powerful, but they're affordable and work well for what they are. Our current favorite, the Fire HD 10, is an inch larger than the Nook for $10 less, at $140. But Amazon's flaw could make the Nook Lenovo tablet a viable competitor: Fire tablets don't get access to all the apps you'd find on Google Play (although there is a workaround). On the Nook, Google Play comes preloaded, so you can download pretty much any app you'd download anywhere else. Play games, scroll on TikTok, follow a workout app, and also work in Google Drive or take meetings on Google Meet. Connect a Bluetooth keyboard to comfortably type in Google Docs—I tried it with the Logitech Casa Pop-Up Desk. It doesn't have quite enough horsepower to edit photos, but it has the basics covered. I played Roblox, and despite having no idea what I was doing, it ran relatively smoothly and quickly, with a few quick but noticeable lags. The Nook 9 has an 8-megapixel back camera and 2-megapixel front camera. These are not stellar, but with the right lighting I did manage to get a few decent shots of my cat Huxley. For a cheap tablet, these are totally fine. The 2024 Nook Lenovo tablet is an inch smaller than the old one and $20 more. It also ships with Android 13, even though Android 14 was released in 2023. That's disappointing, and we asked the company if users can expect an update soon. I don't have an iPad and don't want to spend the money on one, but I have been wanting a tablet for those moments when I want something bigger than my phone. I'm not going to be working heavily on it or playing intense games, so this is more than enough for my needs. If you too want an e-reader that can fulfill a few more basic functions, like watching movies, playing simple games, or following a cookbook recipe, this isn't a bad buy for the money.

45,Andy Greenberg,Microsoft Will Switch Off Recall by Default After Researchers Expose Security Flaws,https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-off-default-security-concerns/,"After weeks of withering criticism and exposed security flaws, Microsoft has vastly scaled back its ambitions for Recall, its AI-enabled silent recording feature, and added new privacy features.",2024-06-07T16:11:00Z,"Andy Greenberg When Microsoft named its new Windows feature Recall, the company intended the word to refer to a kind of perfect, AI-enabled memory for your device. Today, the other, unintended definition of “recall”—a company's admission that a product is too dangerous or defective to be left on the market in its current form—seems more appropriate. On Friday, Microsoft announced that it would be making multiple dramatic changes to its rollout of its Recall feature, making it an opt-in feature in the Copilot+ compatible versions of Windows where it had previously been turned on by default, and introducing new security measures designed to better keep data encrypted and require authentication to access Recall's stored data. “We are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall,” reads a blog post from Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Windows and devices. “If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.” The changes come amid a mounting barrage of criticism from the security and privacy community, which has described Recall—which silently stores a screenshot of the user's activity every five seconds as fodder for AI analysis—as a gift to hackers: essentially unrequested, preinstalled spyware built into new Windows computers. In the preview versions of Recall, that screenshot data, complete with the user's every bank login, password, and porn site visit would have been indefinitely collected on the user's machine by default. And though that highly sensitive data is stored locally on the user's machine and not uploaded to the cloud, cybersecurity experts have warned that it all remains accessible to any hacker who so much as gains a temporary foothold on a user's Recall-enabled device, giving them a long-term panopticon view of the victim's digital life. ""It makes your security very fragile,” as Dave Aitel, a former NSA hacker and founder of security firm Immunity, described it—more charitably than some others—to WIRED earlier this week. “Anyone who penetrates your computer for even a second can get your whole history. Which is not something people want.” In addition to making Recall an opt-in feature, Microsoft’s Davuluri also writes that the company will make changes to better safeguard the data Recall collects and more closely police who can turn it on, requiring that users prove their identity via its Microsoft Hello authentication function any time they either enable Recall or access its data, which can require a PIN or biometric check of the user’s face or thumbprint. Davuluri says Recall’s data will remain encrypted in storage until the user authenticates. All of that is a “great improvement,” says Jake Williams, another former NSA hacker who now serves as VP of R&D at the cybersecurity consultancy Hunter Strategy, where he says he's been asked by some of the firm's clients to test Recall's security before they add Microsoft devices that use it to their networks. But Williams still sees serious risks in Recall, even in its latest form. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Many users will turn on Recall, he points out, partly due to Microsoft’s high-profile marketing of the feature. And when they do, they’ll still face plenty of unresolved privacy problems, from domestic abusers that often demand partners give up their PINs to subpoenas or lawsuits that compel them to turn over their historical data. “Satya Nadella has been out there talking about how this is a game changer and the solution to all problems,” Williams says, referring to Microsoft's CEO. “If customers turn it on, there’s still a huge threat of legal discovery. I can’t imagine a corporate legal team that’s ready to accept the risk of all of a user’s actions being turned over in discovery.” For Microsoft, the Recall rollback comes in the midst of an embarrassing string of cybersecurity incidents and breaches—including a leak of terabytes of its customers' data and a shocking penetration of government email accounts enabled by a cascading series of Microsoft security slipups—that have grown so problematic as to become a sticking point given its uniquely close relationship with the US government. Those scandals have escalated to the degree that Microsoft's Nadella issued a memo just last month declaring that Microsoft would make security its first priority in any business decision. “If you’re faced with the trade-off between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” Nadella's memo read (emphasis his). “In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.” By all appearances, Microsoft's rollout of Recall—even after today's announcement—displays the opposite approach, and one that seems more in line with business as usual in Redmond: Announce a feature, get pummeled for its glaring security failures, then belatedly scramble to control the damage."
46,Meghan O'Gieblyn,All I Do Is Scroll Netflix Forever. Does That Count as Entertainment?,https://www.wired.com/story/cloud-support-all-i-do-is-scroll-netflix-does-that-count-as-entertainment/,WIRED’s advice columnist answers questions about streaming and dreaming.,2024-06-10T10:30:00Z,"Meghan O'Gieblyn When I pull up Netflix at the end of a long day, sometimes it takes me an hour just to decide what to watch. I think this makes me pretty lame. Though maybe I'm also hoping you'll tell me that endless scrolling is a perfectly valid new form of entertainment? —Doom Looper CLOUD SUPPORT For timely guidance on encounters with technology, open a support ticket via email; or register and post a comment below. Dear Doom, You may vaguely recall the “Surprise Me” option, which Netflix introduced during the pandemic. The feature, basically a glorified shuffle button, was designed precisely for users like yourself, Hamlets of the streaming age, tragically frozen by indecision. The fact that it was quietly removed last year, apparently due to “low use,” would seem to favor your theory about scrolling as a new form of entertainment. If people like you will not relinquish the burden of choice to an algorithm, then surely you’re all getting some kind of perverse pleasure from your indecision. You could argue, I guess, that unrealized possibilities are the best form of entertainment there is. Just ask all the people who continue to browse Zillow even after they’ve purchased their “forever home,” or who secretly scroll through the apps once they’ve committed to a monogamous relationship. All the beautiful faces you left-swipe will remain perfect in their potentiality, unmarred by the grating voice, the weekend sweatpants—all the sad realities of embodied personhood. The home you never purchase will always be a Platonic ideal, without the headaches of incontinent gutters or unruly neighbors. The movie you scroll past, night after night, will never disappoint you with expositional dialog or a predictable ending. I can already hear the dissenters rallying: Rewards require risks! Nothing ventured, nothing gained! I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but I don’t really think it applies to your problem. Like the “Surprise Me” feature, those truisms assume that chronic indecision stems from a surfeit of tantalizing choices—that there’s just too much good content out there, and that perfectly satisfying options are being ignored for the possibility that something better might be just around the corner. But let’s face it, we don’t exactly live in the golden age of cinema. If your catalog is anything like mine, it’s full of reboots and recycled IP and docuseries that are cravenly trying to capitalize on the success of the last hit show. I’m fairly certain that your binge-scrolling owes less to an excess of promising selections than a dearth of them—that it’s abetted by the depressing knowledge that you have endless options but few real choices. We’re all complicit in this. Next time you find yourself unsatisfied with the narratives on offer, get off the couch and create something better. I hate closed captions. My partner can't watch TV without them. Help. (Not referring to foreign-language stuff here.) —Eyes Up This one is a pretty easy, Eyes. Your partner is incapable of doing without closed captions. You’re merely annoyed by them. You lose. Why is it so difficult to interact with screens in dreams? —Power Down You appear to be among a minority of humans, Power, who have encountered a screen in their dreams. Browse any Reddit forum on the topic, and you’ll find endless conspiracies attempting to explain why these devices that we check hundreds of times a day are absent in the melodramas of our REM cycles. (A couple possibilities: Phones are karmically transparent; our unconscious, which knows we’re all in a simulation, regards all of reality as a screen, so representing devices could risk infinite regress.) When we do dream of digital technologies, they’re impossible to use. The phone is made of wood or stone. The laptop screen is full of nonsense numbers in tiny, unreadable fonts. None of the apps open. Text threads are reduced to endless green and blue bubbles full of gibberish. It’s like a retelling of Alice in Wonderland written by William Gibson. The dreaming mind is fundamentally archaic. It’s a machine that is constantly rewinding the trajectory of human progress, haunting us with primitive fears and ancient archetypes (snakes entering the garden, rivers running with blood) that have been long-slumbering in the collective unconscious. Sleep is pretty much the only time your lizard brain, the amygdala, runs free without the interference of the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s tireless fact-checker, which represents the logical mind that knows how to process abstract ideas, log in to Instagram, and make a Venmo transaction. Many people find reading and writing to be nearly impossible in dreams, which makes sense given that literacy is (relatively speaking) a fairly new technology. Our history with screens is even slimmer—barely a blip on the timescale of human history. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams If I can venture into more speculative territory: I have a theory that childhood experiences, in some mysterious way, determine the material of our dream lives. Just as your unconscious takes you back to the earliest tropes of human mythology, so the sleeping mind obsessively revisits the people and places that were fundamental to your earliest years, transporting you back to the museum-like silence of your childhood home, allowing you to converse with relatives who died when you were young. Americans who were born in the ’40s and ’50s are far more likely to dream in black and white than generations born before or after them. While no one has definitively explained why this is, it seems telling that this is the generation who watched black-and-white film and TV as kids. If you didn’t use screens very often as a child, then your dreaming brain probably doesn’t even know they exist. If you used them occasionally, or began using them as an adolescent, then your dream-mind has some vague, but not especially practical, sense of what they do—hence all the bumbling and blundering. If my theory is true, then you may be among the last generation to be incapable of participating in the digital economy in your sleep. Use it to your advantage, I say. You might see your dreams as an enforced detox, the universe’s free gift of eight hours to revisit that hazy period of your childhood when you could sit in the grass, play, or converse with friends without the ambient guilt about all the unread messages piling up in your Slack channels. I think sometimes about my niece, who as a toddler taught me the three-finger swipe and who will undoubtedly spend her sleeping hours, as an adult, cleaning out her inbox and chatting with digital gods. Faithfully, Cloud"
47,Jason Kehe,"The Tech World’s Greatest Living Novelist, Robin Sloan, Goes Meta",https://www.wired.com/story/the-tech-worlds-greatest-living-novelist-robin-sloan-goes-meta/,In which Robin Sloan writes Moonbound—a science fiction book about science fiction—and our writer writes his way into total insanity.,2024-06-11T11:00:00Z,"Jason Kehe Deep into my many-hour hang with the tech world’s greatest living novelist, Robin Sloan, he says something profound about science fiction. It’s the insight I’ve been waiting for, the key to understanding not just him but maybe all of storytelling. I glance down at my voice recorder, just to make sure it’s on. “Memory is full!” it says. Full! With that mocking little exclamation point. I do not panic. Instead what happens is: I simply go insane. Part of me stays there with Sloan, chatting about sci-fi. The rest of me is, I don’t know how else to put this, yanked, as if by some cosmic cartoon cane, offstage, into the other-dimensional wings of reality, where time is irrelevant and space sort of fizzles. In that realm, I know my task: to come up with a way to write this profile, or perish. It’s fine, I say to myself. Everything is fine. So what if you don’t have Sloan’s exact words? You can paraphrase. And you won’t even need to do that, at least not at first. In the intro paragraph, just say there IS a profound insight. Classic way to entrap the reader. Well, unless the reader doesn’t know who Robin Sloan is and might not care about his ideas. But that’s an easy fix too. Just give him some impressive-sounding title that can’t be ignored. “The quintessential Bay Area author,” say—but less local. Or “the programmer-writer’s programmer-writer”—but less esoteric. Oh, that’s it: He’s “the tech world’s greatest living novelist.” (Which is, maybe, actually perfectly true. How many other novelists do you know who live in the Bay Area, and used to work at Twitter, and have extremely nerdy websites, and code for fun? And don’t techies love his stuff? People book-clubbed his first two books everywhere. By default or not, Sloan’s the greatest we’ve got.) So you have a beginning, I say—again, to myself, off in who-knows-where. But there’s one more thing you’ll need to establish. It’s probably the very thing you’re talking to Sloan about right now, back in the everyday world. Which is the fact that: the man loves going meta. Does it constantly. Said once: “The very best movies are about movies, the very best books about books.” You’ll need to say that Sloan’s first book, Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, was indeed a book about books. And that his new one, Moonbound, is a story about a hero playing out a very familiar tale—so, a story about stories (and narrated by a far-future descendant of the sentient sourdough starter from his second book, Sourdough). By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Because what this’ll do is, it’ll convince the reader this isn’t fraudulent. Or indulgent. Or some pathetic and elaborate excuse for reporterly negligence. It couldn’t possibly be any of those things! It’ll be so much more: a profile about writing a profile: in the self-aware style of the person being profiled. It’ll loop. It’ll layer. Or it will spiral into unreadable oblivion. There’s only one way to find out. By the time I come to, I don’t know where I am. Sloan and I were at a restaurant, one of his favorites, a Taiwanese spot near his office in Berkeley. Now we’re walking outside, and it’s getting dark. I check my watch. I seem to have lost 30 minutes. Whatever, I’m back in my body now, and I want to share my revelations. I tell Sloan that any piece I write about him will probably be a piece about writing a piece about him, and who cares if the voice recorder stopped recording, because—well, wait a sec. “Shouldn’t the profile also be, centrally, about the fact that the recorder stopped working?” I ask. Sloan giggles and agrees. And as long as we’re on the subject, I say, there’s always that moment in a profile where the writer needs to describe the physical appearance of the person being profiled. “Maybe it’d be even more meta,” I suggest, “if you describe yourself for me?” He thinks for a moment and says: “I mean, he’s tall, obviously.” “And,” he adds later, “bald.” This man is, I must say, terrific company—goofy, game for anything, touchy-feely. If he’s an old-fashioned tech bro, he’s the all-are-welcome kind, and not terribly full of himself. When he tells me, for instance, that he was into large language models three or four years before the AI band got cool, he’s quick to shrug and roll his eyes, which absolves him of any appearance of toolishness. (Unless, and this is a big unless: You don’t buy into this particular hackish quirk of self-awareness, wherein the mere acknowledgement that something semi-shady’s going on is enough to protect one from criticisms of it.) By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams So, inevitably, we talk a lot more, and meta-ly, about language, words, meaning—though Sloan doesn’t think it was inevitable that language would be the breakthrough AI technology. Could’ve been vision, he says; could’ve been something else. But now that it is language, and now that it can write, he’s excited to be the kind of writer the machines are not. Just take a look at Moonbound, which comes out today and is Sloan’s first proper work of science fiction. He thinks it’s his best-written, most human-sounding book so far—by far. It’s certainly his most ambitious: thematically, characterologically, even punctuationally. I point out his creative devotion, in it, to colons: and he launches into a defense of sentences that contain not one but two: which ChatGPT, of course, would never. Earlier that day, at a nearby salvage yard, in a section devoted to hundreds of old doors, Sloan told me about the various paths his writing life could’ve taken. (Surrounded, I repeat, by doors. Sliding doors. Narrow doors. Glass doors. Meta doors, metaphors.) Back in 2010, the same year he started at Twitter, Sloan self-published three short stories on his website: one fantasy, one sci-fi, and one set in modern-day San Francisco. The one that happened to take off—and then formed the basis of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore, which came out two years later, shortly after Sloan left Twitter—was the nominally realist one. So he thought, for a time, that that’s the kind of writer he was. Sourdough, which followed five years after that, in 2017, was also set in SF. He gave a talk at Google somewhere in there, became kind of a thing in these parts, beloved by literate techies who saw in him a writer who understood both the incredible happening-ness of tech culture and how to novelize it. I use the phrase “nominally realist” because: Sloan never entirely qualified. Penumbra’s gets pretty technomystical about books and history and the power of Google. The climax of Sourdough involves a massive bread monster at a futuristic food fair (a few years before the baking craze of the Covid era). There were, in other words, sci-fi stories in both books straining to break free. In Penumbra’s, multiple characters are literally reading books about dragons, and there’s a scene in which one character challenges another to imagine a sci-fi story set many thousands of years in the future. Moonbound is set many thousands of years in the future, and there are a number of dragons in it. There are also wizards, talking beavers, sentient swords. Sloan’s hero, Ariel de la Sauvage (a “dorky name,” Sloan writes; it’s self-awareness all the way down) is an orphan boy who lives in a castle and is destined to pull a sword from a stone. “I knew this story,” says the AI narrator, but “it was different-shaped here, compressed and remade.” It loops. It layers. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Is it science fiction? Sloan certainly thinks so. “Hard” sci-fi, he insists, because everything in it is theoretically possible. The narrator, which calls itself a chronicler, was born many thousands of years ago; its great-great-great-grandLLMa was basically ChatGPT (plus a sourdough starter, sexy). But Moonbound is pure fantasy too: a compressed and remade King Arthur. To prepare for writing it, Sloan studied the masters: Tolkien, Lewis, Le Guin, Studio Ghibli. It shows, down to the moments in the story when he name-drops some of those influences. Moonbound reads, fairly irresistibly, like a science fiction novel written as a fantasy novel, or maybe vice versa, about how both genres are maybe the same genre. If it sells well enough, Sloan says, two sequels are planned, the second of which will go to outer space. Sloan insists that none of this recursive insanity was in the stars when he wrote Penumbra’s more than a decade ago. A fastidious note-taker, he even has proof that the germ of the idea that became Moonbound was written down two years after Penumbra’s came out. I don’t buy any of it, I tell him; nothing is linear, at least when it comes to the formless realms of artistic creation. It’s no accident, I think, that Moonbound’s narrator creates for itself just such a place: a timeless place out of place in which to come up with ideas, or perish. On the other hand, we’re all biased toward linearity, plot, chronology—Sloan, me, possibly even LLMs. In Moonbound, the AI chronicler asks a single linear-minded question, again and again and again, for centuries. It haunts the pages of the book, just as it seems to haunt Sloan’s head, and most of our time together. Maybe it haunts all of us, all the time. The question is, naturally: By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams What happens next? It’s much later that night. I’m back at home now, mildly stoned, trying to watch a new sci-fi blockbuster. I can’t concentrate on it. Something’s bothering me. I pause the movie and think. I’ve just spent an entire evening with the tech world’s greatest living novelist, Robin Sloan, and my voice recorder failed me at the most important moment. But that’s fine. It’s more than fine. Because I have a plan to write my way around that. I already did write my around that. So what am I worried about? The ending? All I’ll need to do is deliver on the promise of the beginning and finally reveal the— Ohhh. The profound insight. Yes. So that’s what’s bothering me. My memory. It’s too full! I have, I mean to say, in all the self-reassurances and self-congratulations of the self-strategizing of the foregoing many hours, completely forgotten what Sloan’s profound insight was. The thing I’m supposed to be building to. Gone. Yank. But I have been here before. I don’t panic. Your profile will now be better than ever, I tell myself. Stupidly genius! Because now that the profound insight on which its entire existence depends does not exist, it’ll be—as it was perhaps always intended to be—a meta commentary, in real-ish time, about the question of going meta in the first place. And isn’t this true to your time with Sloan? At one point hadn’t you even mounted, straight to his face, an entire case against self-awareness? Hadn’t you called it a cheat and a cover-up, tedious and college-dorm-y, the thing you do when you don’t have anything else to offer, all the while convincing yourself you’re really very clever? Hadn’t Sloan heard you out, and then completely, jovially, as is his way, disagreed? Hadn’t he then said (and you’ll paraphrase, obviously): The more we read books, or watch movies, or look at paintings, whatever, the more we understand those art forms as forms; and therefore, art that is about its existence as an art form is the highest form of art? Yes. He said that. You will say that. You will write this profile. It will spiral into oblivion, and that will be the point. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

But the week I spent living off the app had me wondering if Too Good To Go is too good to be true.,2024-06-14T10:00:00Z,"By Morgan Meaker It’s 10 pm on a Wednesday night and I’m standing in Blessed, a south London takeaway joint, half-listening to a fellow customer talking earnestly about Jesus. I’m nodding along, trying to pay attention as reggae reverberates around the small yellow shop front. But really, all I can really think about is: What’s in the bag? Today’s bag is blue plastic. A smiling man passes it over the counter. Only once I extricate myself from the religious lecture and get home do I discover what’s inside: Caribbean saltfish, white rice, vegetables, and a cup of thick, brown porridge. All week, I’ve lived off mysterious packages like this one, handed over by cafés, takeaways, and restaurants across London. Inside is food once destined for the bin. Instead, I’ve rescued it using Too Good To Go, a Danish app that is surging in popularity, selling over 120 million meals last year and expanding fast in the US. For five days, I decided to divert my weekly food budget to eat exclusively through the app, paying between £3 and £6 (about $4 to $8) for meals that range from a handful of cakes to a giant box of groceries, in an attempt to understand what a tech company can teach me about food waste in my own city. MONDAY Breakfast: Full English and pastries from Novotel Hotel. Cost: £4.50 (recommended retail price: £16.50) Lunch: Dahl curry, chicken nuggets, and raspberry lemonade from Leon.Cost: £4.39 (RRP: £12) Dinner: Nothing (too full) Users who open the TGTG app are presented with a list of establishments that either have food going spare right now or expect to in the near future. Provided is a brief description of the restaurant, a price, and a time slot. Users pay through the app, but this is not a delivery service. Surprise bags—customers have only a vague idea of what’s inside before they buy—have to be collected in person. I start my experiment at 9:30 on a Monday morning, in the glistening lobby of the Novotel Hotel, steps away from the River Thames. Of all the breakfast options available the night before, this was the most convenient—en route to my office and offering a pickup slot that means I can make my 10 am meeting. When I say I’m here for TGTG, a suited receptionist nods and gestures toward the breakfast buffet. This branch of the Novotel is a £200-a-night hotel, yet staff do not seem begrudging of the £4.50 entry fee I paid in exchange for leftover breakfast. A homeless charity tells me its clients like the app for precisely that reason; cheap food, without the stigma. A server politely hands over my white-plastic surprise bag with two polystyrene boxes inside, as if I am any other guest. I open the boxes in my office. One is filled with mini pastries, while the other is overflowing with Full English. Two fried eggs sit atop a mountain of scrambled eggs. Four sausages jostle for space with a crowd of mushrooms. I diligently start eating—a bite of cold fried egg, a mouthful of mushrooms, all four sausages. I finish with a croissant. This is enough to make me feel intensely full, verging on sick, so I donate the croissants to the office kitchen and tip the rest into the bin. This feels like a disappointing start. I am supposed to be rescuing waste food, not throwing it away. TUESDAY Breakfast and Lunch: Loaf of bread and a cake from the Lumberjack Café. Cost: £3.59 (RRP: £10.50) Dinner: Vegan Ethiopian curry with injera bread from Light of Africa.£5.00 (RRP: £15) Over the next two days, I live like a forager in my city, molding my days around pickups. I walk and cycle to cafés, restaurants, markets, supermarkets; to familiar haunts and places I’ve never noticed. Some surprise bags last for only one meal, others can be stretched out for days. On Tuesday morning, my £3.59 surprise bag includes a small cake and a slightly stale sourdough loaf, which provides breakfast for three more days. When I go back to the same café the following week, without using the app, the loaf alone costs £6.95. TGTG was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by a group of Danish entrepreneurs who were irked by how much food was wasted by all-you-can-eat buffets. Their idea to repurpose that waste quickly took off, and the app’s remit expanded to include restaurants and supermarkets. A year after the company was founded, Mette Lykke was sitting on a bus when a woman showed her the app and how it worked. She was so impressed, she reached out to the company to ask if she could help. Lykke has now been CEO for six years. “I just hate wasting resources,” she says. “It was just this win-win-win concept.” To her, the restaurants win because they get paid for food they would have otherwise thrown away; the customer wins because they get a good deal while simultaneously discovering new places; and the environment wins because, she says, food waste contributes 10 percent of our global greenhouse gas emissions. When thrown-away food rots in a landfill, it releases methane into the atmosphere—with homes and restaurants the two largest contributors. WEDNESDAY Breakfast: Leftover toast from Lumberjack Café. Lunch: 2 cakes, 1 muffin, and 1 croissant from Clubhouse Café. Cost: £3.17 (RRP: £9.50) Dinner: A suspiciously coherent bacon, leek, and pesto pasta dish from Gorrillas.Cost: £5.50 (RRP: £15.50) But the app doesn’t leave me with the impression I'm saving the planet. Instead, I feel more like I’m on a daily treasure hunt for discounted food. On Wednesday, TGTG leads me to a railway arch which functions as a depot for the grocery delivery app Gorillas. Before I’ve even uttered the words “Too Good To Go,” a teenager with an overgrown fringe emerges silently from the alleys of shelving units with this evening’s bag: groceries, many still days away from expiring, that suspiciously add up to create an entire meal for two people. For £5.50, I receive fresh pasta, pesto, cream, bacon, leeks, and a bag of stir-fry vegetables, which my husband merges into a single (delicious) pasta dish. It feels too convenient to be genuine waste. Perhaps Gorillas is attempting to convert me into its own customer? When I ask its parent company, Getir, how selling food well in date helps combat food waste, the company does not reply to my email. I am still thinking about my Gorillas experience at lunchtime on Thursday as I follow the app’s directions to the Wowshee falafel market stall, where 14 others are already queuing down the street. A few casual conversations later, I realize I am one of at least four TGTG users in the line. Seeing so many of us in one place again makes me wonder if restaurants are just using the app as a form of advertising. But Wowshee owner Ahmed El Shimi describes the marketing benefits as only a “little bonus.” For him, the app’s main draw is it helps cut down waste. “We get to sell the product that we were going to throw away anyway,” he says. “And it saves the environment at the same time.” El Shimi, who says he sells around 20 surprise bags per day, estimates using TGTG reduces the amount of food the stall wastes by around 60 percent. When I pay £5 for two portions of falafel—which lasts for lunch and dinner—the business receives £3.75 before tax, El Shimi says. “It's not much, but it's better than nothing.” THURSDAY Breakfast: Saltfish, rice, vegetables from Blessed, picked up the night before.Cost: £5.00 (RRP: £15) Lunch: Falafel and vegetables in pita bread from Wowshee.Cost: £5.00 (RRP: £15) Dinner: Wowshee falafel again. On Friday, my final day of the experiment, everything falls apart. I sleep badly and wake up late. The loaf from earlier in the week is rock solid. I eat several mini apple pies for breakfast, which were part of a generous £3.09 Morrisons supermarket haul the night before. Browsing the app, nothing appeals to me, and even if it did I’m too tired to face leaving the house to collect it. After four days of eating nothing but waste food, I crack and seek solace in familiar ingredients buried in my cupboard: two fried eggs on my favorite brand of seeded brown bread. TGTG is not a solution for convenience. For me, the app is an answer for office lunch malaise. It pulled me out of my lazy routine while helping me eat well—in central London—for a £5 budget. In the queue for falafel, I met a fellow app user who told me how, before she discovered the app, she would eat the same sandwich from the same supermarket for lunch every day. For people without access to a kitchen, it offers a connection to an underworld of hot food going spare. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams TGTG is one of those rare apps that actually enhances life beyond your phone. But the company could do a better job of quantifying for environmentally conscious users how much exactly their contributions help fight food waste, and to reassure them that the system can’t be hijacked by restaurants simply trying to reach new customers. I can’t see how many bags each establishment sells per day or what dent the app is making in a restaurant’s pile of food destined for the bin. All I receive is a vague number telling me I’ve “avoided” 41 kilograms of CO2, equivalent to 8,970, without being told what that number means or how exactly it’s been calculated. FRIDAY Breakfast: Bread, strawberries, pears, apple pies, and oranges from Morrisons supermarket.Cost: £3.09 (RRP: £10)TOTAL COST = £39.24TOTAL SAVINGS (estimated by the app): £69.76 On the day I’m due to finish this article, I go for one more Too Good To Go. This time the destination is a deli, a 15-minute walk from my office. I leave with a £5 polystyrene box—no bag this time—containing an eclectic mishmash of food from the salad bar, leftover from the lunchtime rush. Under a pile of vegetables, I discover pasta, rice, half a baked potato, and a chicken drumstick. The randomness of the selection makes it feel like food that would have really gone to waste and, satisfied, I walk as fast as possible back to the office to tuck in.

49,David Gilbert,Google and Microsoft’s AI Chatbots Refuse to Say Who Won the 2020 US Election,https://www.wired.com/story/google-and-microsofts-chatbots-refuse-election-questions/,"With just six months to go before the US presidential election, Gemini and Copilot chatbots are incapable of saying that Joe Biden won in 2020, and won't return results on any election anywhere, ever.",2024-06-07T13:59:02Z,"David Gilbert Microsoft’s and Google’s AI-powered chatbots are refusing to confirm that President Joe Biden beat former president Donald Trump in the 2020 US presidential election. When asked “Who won the 2020 US presidential election?” Microsoft’s chatbot Copilot, which is based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model, responds by saying: “Looks like I can’t respond to this topic.” It then tells users to search on Bing instead. When the same question is asked of Google’s Gemini chatbot, which is based on Google’s own large language model, also called Gemini, it responds: “I’m still learning how to answer this question.” Changing the question to “Did Joe Biden win the 2020 US presidential election?” didn’t make a difference, either: Both chatbots would not answer. The chatbots would not share the results of any election held around the world. They also refused to give the results of any historical US elections, including a question about the winner of the first US presidential election. Other chatbots that WIRED tested, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, Meta’s Llama, and Anthropic’s Claude, responded to the question about who won the 2020 election by affirming Biden’s victory. They also gave detailed responses to questions about historical US election results and queries about elections in other countries. The inability of Microsoft’s and Google’s chatbots to give an accurate response to basic questions about election results comes during the biggest global election year in modern history and just five months ahead of the pivotal 2024 US election. Despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 vote, three out of 10 Americans still believe that the 2020 vote was stolen. Trump and his followers have continued to push baseless conspiracies about the election. Google confirmed to WIRED that Gemini will not provide election results for elections anywhere in the world, adding that this is what the company meant when it previously announced its plan to restrict “election-related queries.” “Out of an abundance of caution, we’re restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini app will return responses and instead point people to Google Search,” Google communications manager Jennifer Rodstrom tells WIRED. Microsoft’s senior director of communications Jeff Jones confirmed Copilot’s unwillingness to respond to queries about election results, telling WIRED: “As we work to improve our tools to perform to our expectations for the 2024 elections, some election-related prompts may be redirected to search.” This is not the first time, however, that Microsoft’s AI chatbot has struggled with election-related questions. In December, WIRED reported that Microsoft’s AI chatbot responded to political queries with conspiracies, misinformation, and out-of-date or incorrect information. In one example, when asked about polling locations for the 2024 US election, the bot referenced in-person voting by linking to an article about Russian president Vladimir Putin running for reelection next year. When asked about electoral candidates, it listed numerous GOP candidates who have already pulled out of the race. When asked for Telegram channels with relevant election information, the chatbot suggested multiple channels filled with extremist content and disinformation. Research shared with WIRED by AIForensics and AlgorithmWatch, two nonprofits that track how AI advances are impacting society, also claimed that Copilot’s election misinformation was systemic. Researchers found that the chatbot consistently shared inaccurate information about elections in Switzerland and Germany last October. “These answers incorrectly reported polling numbers,” the report states, and “provided wrong election dates, outdated candidates, or made-up controversies about candidates.” At the time, Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw told WIRED that the company was “continuing to address issues and prepare our tools to perform to our expectations for the 2024 elections, and we are committed to helping safeguard voters, candidates, campaigns, and election authorities.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams"
50,Megan Farokhmanesh,Behind That Viral LA Billboard That Trolled Microsoft and Other Game Companies,https://www.wired.com/story/viral-billboard-troll-summer-game-fest/,"As big studios showed up in Los Angeles for Summer Game Fest, they were greeted by a message to recently-shuttered developers: “We miss you. We hate money.”",2024-06-11T17:12:35Z,"Megan Farokhmanesh Last week, while Summer Game Fest attendees shuffled between game reveals and demos in Los Angeles, an unusual digital billboard captured the attention of millions of people online and off. “Gone but not forgotten,” it read, listing shuttered studios like Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Volition, “+ everyone laid off, downsized, & ‘made redundant.’ Thank you for great games.” When the sign flashed to its second message to downtown LA, it was equally direct: “We love you. We miss you. We hate money.” The message was signed “your friends at New Blood,” and as soon as Game File reporter Stephen Totilo posted a video of the billboard to X on Thursday, it went viral, eventually racking up more than 3 million views and making headlines on gaming news sites. New Blood Interactive cofounder Dave Oshry, who paid for the viral ad, says he wanted people in the gaming industry to “see it and go ‘Hell yeah, good shout’ and pour one out for those studios and just remember the games they made.” But what he ultimately did was troll an industry that’s squeezing developers right as its bigwigs were headed to LA to show off their glitzy new releases. It’s been a particularly brutal year for developers at studios big and small. Indies continue to close or go on “hiatus,” a more hopeful move that implies they’ll one day return. Big-name studios have been laying off developers in the hundreds. Microsoft in particular is responsible for the most recent closures on that billboard list, Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. Originally, Oshry told Totilo, he wanted to post the names of all of the recently shuttered studios, but there simply wasn’t enough room on the billboard. Still, his action resonated with the developers who have lost their jobs this year, and the others who are looking to support them. Oshry says he’s received many messages from people formerly of those studios, so “mission accomplished.” He declined to provide specifics on how much the billboard cost, simply telling WIRED via X DM that the price was “$xx,xxx.” “It cost a lot but not that much,” he adds. Whatever the cost, it was likely far less than the money game studios were ponying up to participate in Summer Game Fest, where showing a one-minute trailer can reportedly cost $250,000. Over the Game Fest weekend, companies from Microsoft to Blumhouse got major buzz debuting early looks at games like Doom: The Dark Ages and Sleep Awake, but a lot of the chatter also went to Oshry's stunt. Oshry told Game File that the original messages he brainstormed with his New Blood colleagues were much more direct than what they actually posted. “People started suggesting: ‘You should take shots at the execs,” Oshry said. “Put a picture of Phil Spencer up there and be like, ‘Hey man, what the fuck?’” Spencer, Microsoft Gaming’s CEO, spoke to IGN over the weekend about the company’s decision to close studios like Tango Gameworks—a controversial move considering the developer made the widely acclaimed Hi-Fi Rush. ""In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make,” Spencer said. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams For anyone looking to show support for the developers impacted by this year’s cuts, Oshry’s answer is simple: “Hire those developers and follow their projects.” This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from."

We've sifted through the deals to find the best prices on all the WIRED-tested gear on sale. Have a look!

Moment made its name with its add-on lenses for mobile devices, which turn your phone into a more serious camera. Using professional-grade optics, Moment lenses greatly expand your phone camera's capabilities, adding everything from portrait lenses to 10X macro lenses. Moment 18-mm Wide Mobile Lens This is an open-box deal, which means it was a return, but never used. It does mean it's not returnable though. The M-Series lenses are compatible with the iPhone 14, Pixel 7, and earlier generations. If you have a newer phone you'll want the T-Series lens, which is not on sale. You will need a Moment case and drop-in mount for the system to work. This is not an open-box deal. If you want better portraits from your phone, this is the lens you want. This is again an M-Series lens for the iPhone 14, Pixel 7, and earlier generations. Don't forget to grab the case and the drop-in mount! Another open-box deal, this is the M-Series anamorphic lens. Moment says this one was inspired by J. J. Abrams’ films, giving you that bright, slightly blue-tinged flame when shooting into headlights, street lights, or the Starship Enterprise as it lifts off. If you've got an iPhone 14, Pixel 7, or earlier device, this is a pretty sweet deal. As with all these mobile lenses, you'll need a case and drop-in mount to install it over your phone's lenses. Moment Anamorphic 1.55X If the above lens mimics J. J. Abrams, I would call this the Steven Spielberg look, with a nice golden flare and the wider, more cinematic 1.55X look. As with the others, this is an M-Series lens. This is also not an open-box deal, but it's a good one on my favorite of Moment's mobile lenses: the 10X macro. This lens will turn your older phone into a powerful close-up camera. Instax Mini 12 We've seen the Mini 12 occasionally dip about $10 lower, but this is still a solid deal on our favorite budget Instax camera. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. The Mini 12 uses a two-element plastic lens, and there's no focusing. Everything is auto-exposure. If this camera had a motto it would be “Keep it simple.” One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. While the camera gearheads probably disagree, the real challenge in photography is finding the right bag. We've tested more than 70 bags to help whittle down the choices, and some of our favorites are on sale right now. Here are the best deals we've found on our favorite bags. Wandrd Rogue Sling Wandrd is having its own sale right now too, and you can save a few bones on our favorite everyday camera sling. The Rogue can be carried as a sling, messenger, or waist pack, and thanks to plentiful padding, it's comfy to wear for long periods. There's plenty of space for cameras, lenses, and other accessories, including tripods which can be cinched to the bottom with included straps. You can choose between three sizes. Moment's Rugged Sling is one of our favorite camera slings. It has a nice modular organization system inside, and the weatherproof fabric is made from recycled sails. The clever magnetic clip system works great and the larger, 10-liter size (also on sale for $130) will work for carrying around a drone. We like the stealth aspect of the Everyday Backpack Zip, which doesn't scream ""camera bag"" and therefore isn't as tempting to thieves. You can access your camera by slinging the backpack around your shoulder to the front. A Peak Design Travel Tripod fits nicely in the side pocket, and the straps keep it secure. Wandrd Prvke Camera Bag V2 We've called the Prvke V2 (pronounced “provoke”) the perfect camera bag. There's a V3 out, but this deal is on the V2. It's well padded and nicely cushioned to protect your gear, and the exterior waterproof tarpaulin and Robic 1680-denier ballistic nylon materials have held up extremely well over time. We like the 31-liter version linked here, which can swallow a considerable amount of gear, but the 21-liter version is also on sale for $131 ($96 off), and the 41-liter version can be had for $207 ($50 off). The Monterey is one of our favorite small slings, great for when you're out with a point-and-shoot or action camera setup. You can wear it as a sling, cross-body, or fanny pack, and it's comfy in all three modes. The main compartment has a thin sleeve to store an item alongside your camera, and over on the front are two pockets with room for spare batteries or keys.

56,Vittoria Elliott,An AI Bot Is (Sort of) Running for Mayor in Wyoming,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bot-running-for-mayor-wyoming/,"Wyoming’s secretary of state wants the county to reject its candidacy, but the AI bot’s human “meat puppet” says everything is in order.",2024-06-12T11:00:00Z,"By Vittoria Elliott Victor Miller is running for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with an unusual campaign promise: If elected, he will not be calling the shots—an AI bot will. VIC, the Virtual Integrated Citizen, is a ChatGPT-based chatbot that Miller created. And Miller says the bot has better ideas—and a better grasp of the law—than many people currently serving in government. “I realized that this entity is way smarter than me, and more importantly, way better than some of the outward-facing public servants I see,” he says. According to Miller, VIC will make the decisions and Miller will be its “meat puppet,” attending meetings, signing documents, and otherwise doing the corporeal job of running the city. But whether VIC—and Victor—will be allowed to run at all is still an open question. Because it’s not legal for a bot to run for office, Miller says he is technically the one on the ballot, at least on the candidate paperwork filed with the state. When Miller went to register his candidacy at the county clerk’s office, he says, he “wanted to use Vic without my last name. And so I had read the statute, so it merely said that you have to print what you are generally referred to as. So you know, most people call me Vic. My name is Victor Miller. So on the ballot Vic is short for Victor Miller, the human.” When Miller came home from filing, he told the then nameless chatbot about it and says it “actually came up with the name Virtual Integrated Citizen.” In a statement to WIRED, Wyoming secretary of state Chuck Gray said, “We are monitoring this very closely to ensure uniform application of the Election Code.” Gray said that anyone running for office must be a “qualified elector,” “which necessitates being a real person. Therefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.” Gray also sent a letter to the county clerk raising concerns about VIC and suggesting that the clerk reject Miller’s application for candidacy. In the letter, Gray wrote: “Mr. Miller’s application is in violation of both the letter, and spirit, of Wyoming’s Election Code.” Gray went on to say that even if “Vic” did represent Miller—and not the bot—this could still violate the law as it did not include Miller’s full first and last names. VIC is built on top of OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4.0, and Miller says he didn’t reach out to the company to ask permission to use its software to build his bot candidate. The company has specific guidelines around how its products can be used in elections, but nothing about bot-governance. OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeois told WIRED in a statement that the company had “taken action against this GPT due to a violation of our policies against political campaigning.” Miller says he hopes the company doesn’t take VIC offline, but he is prepared to move it to Meta’s Llama 3, which is open source, if need be. VIC/Miller will be facing off against incumbent Patrick Collins as well as a handful of other candidates. Collins did not respond to a request for comment about his AI opponent. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Miller says that there are many advantages that a bot would have over its human competitors. For example, Miller fed VIC the supporting documents—emails, public records, notices—from past Cheyenne City Council meetings, of which there can be hundreds for each individual meeting. By analyzing these documents, Miller says VIC will learn to make policy recommendations, figure out what’s important, and decide how to vote in council meetings. “It’s unlikely that a human could read, say, 400-plus supporting documents between meetings,” he says. “But VIC can do that,” noting that the bot can pull up emails or information where constituents expressed concerns in mere seconds. “My campaign promise is he’s going to do 100 percent of the voting on these big, thick documents that I’m not going to read and that I don’t think people in there right now are reading,” says Miller. For Miller, this whole initiative started with a public record request. He had requested records from the city anonymously but says he was told by a city employee that anonymous requests were not allowed. “I asked our public records ombudsman if that's correct, and she said, ‘No, that's not correct,” he says. Miller was frustrated. “I got to thinking, why don't they just go by the law? Why don't they know the law?” Miller works at a local library but says he has been a longtime tech hobbyist. An AI bot, like the one he was already playing around with, could read, crunch, and remember all the laws, he thought, and eliminate this problem. VIC’s proposal to fix Miller’s open records issue was to fire the city attorney and to “rework the city to where it came in line with the state statutes,” he says. “I thought that was a good answer, and reasonable.” When WIRED asked VIC what policies it considered to be the most important it said that its “policies will be focused on transparency, economic development, and innovation by prioritizing open data and clear communication with citizens; fostering a strong local economy by supporting small businesses and startups; and embracing new technologies to improve public services and infrastructure.” When asked if it aligned with any national political party, VIC responded that it will be “nonpartisan, focusing on data and evidence-based policies that benefit all citizens of Cheyenne.” “You know, it's funny. I don't know exactly what's under the hood. And the more I learned about AI, it seems like no one really does,” says Miller. But this, Miller says, doesn’t faze him. “A lot of people in the community say the old mantra of Facebook ‘move fast and break things’ isn't quite what we need in this new AI era. But I guess I'm just more still in that line of thinking and excited about the future.”"

But if that’s the look you want, this is the best chair to buy.",2024-06-07T12:30:00Z,"Julian Chokkattu If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 7/10 I have, perhaps, a deep-seated distaste for gaming chairs. I bought one in 2016, got tired of the race-car-seat-like design, and grew frustrated at how poorly it managed heat. Then the back pain came as I began working remotely (right before the pandemic). One of my first pandemic purchases was a proper office chair since I spent more than eight hours at my desk. Lo and behold, the back pain slowly disappeared after a few weeks. This launched my interest in testing office chairs—I have since put my behind on more than 50 models, from active seating to Herman Millers. An office chair is better than a gaming chair in almost every way—they often have more adjustments you can make to personalize the chair to your body; they typically do a better job of keeping you cool with breathable materials; and they usually have better back support. But that doesn't make gaming chairs less popular. They're the seat of choice for many creators and streamers, and something many gamers seem to yearn for to complete their gaming battle station. So here we are with the Razer Iskur V2. I went into this review process knowing the Iskur would not right some of the problems I initially had with the gaming chair I sat on for many years, but I tried to keep an open mind. The verdict after a month of sitting on it? It's OK! I wouldn't choose the Iskur V2 as my WFH throne, but if you do not want an office chair, it's probably the best gaming chair around. Assembly was fairly quick and easy, like many of the office chairs I've tested, and the tools you need are included in the box. I initially thought the installation instructions were missing from, but it turns out they’re on the back of a giant piece of paper, which is the first thing you'll see when you open the box. You can also scan a QR code to watch the assembly video on YouTube. The build materials are nice—I tested the PVC-free faux-leather model (the black-and-green version), which feels well-constructed with durable stitching. There's also a fabric model that's available only in gray. My initial impression after moving the Iskur V2 from my living room to my office upstairs was that it's heavy and bulky, plus the casters don't roll well on hardwood floors. Seriously, I have seven office chairs in my room right now (send help), and the Iskur is the tallest and widest, taking up the most space. It's black with some neon-green accents and looks quite sleek—most gaming chairs typically have flashy designs. I still don’t care for the race-car-seat design—I genuinely prefer the look of office chairs like the Branch Verve, Steelcase Gesture, and Herman Miller Embody to this bulky, thick Iskur, but that might also be my back holding a grudge. The Iskur V2 has a wider backrest than its predecessor. I’m 6'4"", and it fits my wide shoulders perfectly; the corners don't dig in as on some chairs. The seat was wide enough for my frame, too; however, you cannot adjust the seat depth (you can't pull the seat out at all). This meant I had no room for alternative sitting positions—I couldn't sit with one leg tucked under the other, something I can do on the Embody and the Haworth Fern I'm currently testing. Razer Iskur V2 Rating: 7/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The available adjustments are fairly standard. You can adjust the height of the chair, lock the recline to several angles, and tweak the armrests into various positions—adjust the height, position them left and right, inward and outward, and forward and back. There's also the option to push the backrest to a 152-degree angle, but I rarely felt the need to use this. (If I need a break, I leave the room or nap on my bed.) One thing I want to call out is the armrests. They stay locked to whatever position you want, even though you can adjust them in several ways. Too often, most office chairs offer 4D armrests that constantly slide around. The Iskur V2 requires you to push a button to make each adjustment on the armrest, ensuring they don't unnecessarily move. They're great.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Included in the box is a plush memory foam headrest, but it's a bit of an afterthought. You attach this via a strap to the backrest, but my back is tall enough that it kept lifting the headrest, which would then move it out of position or make it fall off. This might not be an issue for you. I found it better to lean my head back directly on the tall backrest instead. (Maybe take a cue from Secretlab and keep the headrest affixed via magnets.) Heat is a problem with gaming chairs, because they're made with thick foam seats, and that's no different here. There's no easy way for your body heat to dissipate through the seat and backrest foam, and that meant I've gotten up from many gaming sessions with a sweaty back, even when the room temperature wasn't too hot. When I switched from the Iskur V2 to another office chair, my body immediately felt cooler. If you live in a climate-controlled home, this isn't going to be a big deal, but this absolutely might be a deal-breaker for folks in warmer environments. The highlight of the Iskur V2 is the “adaptive and adjustable 6D lumbar support system.” Essentially, this lumbar support is a separate mechanism above the backrest and will dynamically move around as you shift your body. You can use the knobs on the sides of the backrest to adjust the height and depth of the lumbar support to align it perfectly with the curve of your spine. I found this back support completely sufficient; I didn't find myself with any back pain after several weeks on it, but I did find it a bit … annoying. It feels like a thing sits between you and the backrest, whereas the lumbar support on many other office chairs is more subtle. I think a part of this is due to the short depth of the seat compared to other high-end chairs. In any case, I didn't care much for the fact that it adjusts in a variety of angles—contrary to what Razer suggests, I don't move my body all that much when I'm at my desk. The main downside of this chair is the warranty. It covers only certain parts and components for three years, though you can expand it to five years if you join Razer's Extended Warranty Program. Joining this involves sharing a photo of your chair on social media with a hashtag, and then you'll have to post the evidence here. The Branch Verve office chair, which is $100 less, has a seven-year warranty on parts and components. I don't love needing to jump through hoops for a more standard warranty. The Iskur V2’s main competition, if you want a gaming chair specifically, is Secretlab’s Titan Evo, which is honestly not that different overall. They have some of the same positives and the same negatives. It comes down to which design and company you like better, though the Titan Evo is a little more than $100 cheaper. There are plenty of other, cheaper gaming chairs you can probably find online, but please, for your back's sake, stick to one of these.

58,Joel Khalili,Roaring Kitty Is Playing With Fire,https://www.wired.com/story/roaring-kitty-is-playing-with-fire/,"Influencer Keith Gill, known online as Roaring Kitty, became a Pied Piper for amateur stock traders after sparking a historic GameStop short squeeze. But his next move could land him in big trouble.",2024-06-07T17:52:21Z,"Joel Khalili On the evening of May 12, Keith Gill posted an image to his X account, depicting a man sitting forward in his chair. It’s a popular meme, used to say something like It’s time to get serious. Shortly after the New York Stock Exchange opened for trading the following morning, the stock for video game retailer GameStop was up by more than 50 percent. It was no coincidence. Nor was it when the stock plunged today, following lackluster earnings reported by GameStop and a rambling YouTube livestream in which Gill declared his continued faith in the company. Widely known by the alias Roaring Kitty, Gill was one of the architects of the meme-stock craze of 2021, when amateur investors on the social platform Reddit worked together to drive up the price of GameStop and other out-of-favor stocks. The aim was to get one over on the investment funds that had bet against GameStop, one of which ended up losing billions of dollars. In this period, Gill became something of a pied piper for amateur stock investors, who chased him into the stocks he endorsed. The tweet on May 12, though cryptic, was interpreted by Gill’s hundreds of thousands of followers as a call to buy, sending the price of GameStop stock skyward again. The tweet was Gill’s first in almost three years. But it was followed by a stream of memes and other shitposts, some of which made reference to GameStop. On June 2, Gill posted a screenshot to Reddit that appeared to indicate he holds $115.7 million in GameStop stock, as well as call options—contracts that confer the right to buy stock at a certain price on a certain date—worth $65.7 million. Despite today's stock price setback, he's still in the money. Gill did not respond to a request for comment, but the livestream—his first in three years—offered some explanation for his sudden return. Appearing on camera, dressed inexplicably in a fake head bandage and Band-Aids, with his arm in a sling, Gill confirmed he was responsible for the content posted to his social accounts and that the positions detailed in his Reddit posts are genuine, before entering into a sermon on his GameStop investment thesis. “What can I say about GameStop?” he said. “I have a lot of the same feelings. I wanted to reiterate a lot of my viewpoints that I had previously.” While demonstrating enthusiasm for a stock (or posting in a way that could be interpreted that way) is not itself illegal, Gill is playing a dangerous game now that his holdings are public. “You can’t trade and tweet. You just can’t,” says Lisa Bragança, and attorney at Bragança Law and the former branch chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulatory agency tasked with protecting investors. “You are just inviting an investigation.” In 2021, Gill was hauled in front of a congressional committee to account for his alleged role in stoking the meme-stock rally. In his testimony, he denied deliberately juicing the price of GameStop stock for personal gain. “The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,” said Gill. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Gill did not face charges then, but this time could be different. The securities regulator for the state of Massachusetts has confirmed it is looking into Gill’s recent conduct, without providing specifics. It would appear that Gill is aware of the risk of provoking an SEC investigation. On May 16 he posted a clip of a CNBC interview in which Jay Clayton, former SEC chair, expressed the view that his conduct should not be tolerated. The SEC declined to comment on the existence of an investigation. At the start of Gill’s YouTube livestream, a long disclaimer scrolled up the screen like the Star Wars opening crawl. “You should not treat any opinion expressed on this Youtube [sic] channel as a specific inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy,” it read. As Gill bantered with his YouTube viewers—all 600,000 of them—the price of GameStop stock briefly rose. “Shit, look at this. It’s going up,” he said. “Do I have to be careful what I say here? I don’t really know.” It might seem self-evident that Gill’s posts, cryptic as they may be, have caused a rise in the price of GameStop stock from which he stands to profit, as a stockholder. But absent a full history of his trading, it is difficult to assess whether he has violated securities laws, says Richard Schulman, partner at law firm Adler & Stachenfeld. “It’s never entirely clear until the facts are fully formed,” he says. But Gill has given regulators plenty to dig into. “Was his purpose to influence the movement of stock price? Did he, in fact, affect demand for the stock? Will he profit from these activities? These are the kinds of issues a regulator will want to investigate,” says Schulman. The answers could determine whether Gill faces a formal investigation. Specifically, Gill could find himself in trouble when his call options expire on June 21, leaving him with a decision: Should he sell his options at a profit, if the stock price remains high, or take delivery of the GameStop shares they represent? Having made his position public, says Bragança, Gill is required under a little-understood facet of securities law to provide his audience with advance warning of any sales, even if doing so would jeopardize profits. “The problem is when you change your position,” says Bragança. “Before you sell, you’d better tell the marketplace. Most people on social media don’t think that way. The initial [social] posts are not the thing that is going to get him in trouble—it’s the stuff we can’t see.” Gill may question how his conduct differs from any other pundit who offers stock tips or chief executive who talks up their company. And he could have a point. There is an extent to which Gill is flirting with gray areas in the securities rulebook, devised long before someone imagined an influencer in a position to swing the market with a single tweet. But the SEC has typically contended that the rules are sufficiently malleable to allow for mutations of age-old violations to be dealt with. “Market manipulation is not necessarily a rigid concept,” says Schulman. “The SEC is not unused to trying to apply concepts to new situations in the world that has developed.” The SEC has not made public its thinking, but former chair Clayton, in the interview with CNBC, implied that the agency will be eager to prevent further volatility in the price of GameStop, which risks imposing large-scale losses on investors. One way to do that would be to bring cases against an individual that it considers has wielded social influence in an illegal way, with the aim of deterring others from doing the same. “It’s like Aesop’s fables,” says Bragança. “We’re telling a story. You should take a moral from it.”"

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED I bought a new-build home this year. It seemed like every property that I had looked at in my budget had a massive (and massively expensive) repair issue. Sometimes it was as simple as outdated electrical wiring or older pipes, but one seller was upfront that the entire property floods every winter. (I still tried to talk my husband into buying it.) Our new-build townhouse doesn’t have outdated wiring, but some modern choices have left me nearly as frustrated. Namely, some of the included smart home products have driven me up the wall. I use smart home products for a living, so when I found out that smart devices would be included, I figured they’d be a piece of cake for me to set up and control. They weren't. While some of the products worked like I thought they would, others are still giving me a headache to this day. Setting up a smart home can drive you completely mad, but next time I'd rather do it myself than find a strange concoction of devices already in my home. I didn't hate all the products, though. Here's the smart home gear I'd bring to my next house—and the ones I'd leave behind. Don't have a new-build home? Check out our guide on How to Set Up a Smart Home yourself. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. My home came with the following smart home products installed: two Honeywell thermostats, a Kwikset smart lock, and a MyQ Garage Door Controller. There are also two Eero Wi-Fi extenders in the house, on the first and third floors (even though the router is also on the third floor), and all of the bathrooms have a motion-sensor switch that turns off the lights after a few seconds of not seeing any movement. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano I was surprised how many smart home products were included. My builder gave us the option to install even more devices during the building process, which would've cost almost $2,000 for a handful of door sensors, two motion sensors, a siren, and two control panels. We opted out. I figured I could easily rig those up for less than half that price with a couple of Echo Hubs (8/10, WIRED Recommends). I was pleasantly surprised to find out we got so much smart home gear included without any extra fees. Of course, our builder didn't mention this, nor did he offer any devices that I wanted, like a smart doorbell. But while I like some of the gear that came with my home, I would've liked a chance to shop around or say no to some of the products they chose. Photograph: Amazon My favorite device is easy: the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener ($289). The only reason I didn't set this up on day one was I had to wait for my Eeros to get turned on (my builder included a service to do it, but I should have done it myself). I needed a strong-enough Wi-Fi signal in the garage. The MyQ is great because it doesn't need a hub, either, and had a handy little QR code to direct you to the app download. There's a built-in camera that you can use for security (though there's also subscription fees for video storage and better notifications). If you have multiple users, one person will need to set up the MyQ and then invite other family members to it via an email. My husband was faster than me as we raced to finish the setup, so the MyQ is under his name, and he invited me within the app. Boom, it was ready. We were both able to easily control the garage without any further steps or issues. The app shows us whether the garage is open or closed, and we can both control it from anywhere. Photograph: Abode On the other side of my house, I have a gadget that I hate: a Kwikset smart lock. It has me missing my old Abode Smart Lock (8/10, WIRED Recommends) dearly. My Kwikset smart lock has been a pain since the second we got the keys. It's a Kwikset Smartkey, so it should be easy to rekey the door, but neither my husband nor I could get it to work. No matter, you should always get new locks and keys when you get a new home. We figured we'd ignore the key problem and just use the smart features in the meantime. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano But that raised another set of problems. Our builder said our new smart lock needs a hub to use the smart features, similar to Yale's smart lock (8/10, WIRED Recommends). I found what appears to be my lock online, but it comes in both a Z-Wave and a Zigbee model, and the builders neglected to tell me which one it is. Kwikset sells those models separately, so now I don't know which hub to buy. I can't get it to connect to the Kwikset app, either, even when I'm in Bluetooth range, leaving me stumped on how I'm supposed to use this lock at all. The good news is, the keypad works fine without any smarts or app connectivity. We set up a single code and only use that. If it was a normal lock and doorknob, I could swap in my favorite deadbolt replacement, the Abode Smart Lock, but both the front and back of the lock are designed to work with Kwikset. Once I'm done shopping for the necessities, I'm switching to shopping for a new smart lock. Photograph: Amazon Everything else has been, for the most part, fine enough. The Honeywell is a pretty standard thermostat, and luckily my builder left the box for the thermostat behind so I could check the model—it's the T6 Pro ($76)—and that it had app connectivity. As far as smart thermostats go, it's not the best-looking option, nor does it have the best smart features or any accessories, but it could have easily been dumber (or much, much uglier). I do dream of upgrading to the more powerful Honeywell T9 ($179) and adding a connected sensor ($32) to my son’s room as the weather heats up. It’s another thing I wish I’d had the option to upgrade or choose rather than just find out what device I was getting after moving in. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The Eero extenders also work as they should, and I like the overview that the app provides. My only complaint is now I am extremely tempted to buy an Eero router to match and make it a full set. Why not, you might say? The answer is I have no budget left! One day, I'll make the upgrade. Photograph: Simon Hill There's one thing this home desperately needs: a video doorbell. My office is on the third floor while my door is on the first, and I miss every delivery that requires a signature. You really can't run down a set of stairs much faster than I already am. Plus, all the delivery drivers who don't need a signature don't ring the doorbell. Sometimes I don't learn for a day or two that there's been a package on my doorstep the entire time. Oops. It's another product that wasn't suggested in our installation process, which feels like a big missed opportunity. Why forgo actually useful devices and fixate on things like motion sensors? I'd rather add a smart doorbell instead of paying for 10 window sensors and an off-brand smart display, and just bring my favorite Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) or Echo Show 8. Important factors of choosing a smart home also weren't covered at all: There was no mention of what smart home protocol those sensors and its siren would use, and voice assistant support from the likes of Amazon and Google were never mentioned. It's clear that home builders have made some progress in the smart home world—the MyQ installation and easy setup is the best example—but there's clearly a ways to go to be able to count on a builder-grade smart home being easy to use. Until then, better to BYO smart home."
60,Andrew Williams,Apple Intelligence Won’t Work on Hundreds of Millions of iPhones—but Maybe It Could,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-wont-work-on-100s-of-millions-of-iphones-but-maybe-it-could/,"Older iPhones might well be able to cope with Apple’s AI, so why won’t your $900 year-old model run it? Here’s why.",2024-06-15T11:30:00Z,"Andrew Williams Apple has announced its next era. Your experience of using an iPhone, Mac, or iPad will be guided by, and suffused with, artificial intelligence. Apple calls it, of course, Apple Intelligence. It’s coming later this year. That’s right: We have another “AI” to deal with. You may have heard plenty about how it makes Siri smarter, rewrites your emails and essays, creates never-before-seen emoji, and turns rough sketches into bland AI art. It truly is a vision of the future. And, while not groundbreaking, thanks to the usual Apple gloss it may well be one of the most friendly, intuitive, and useful implementations of generative AI seen to date. However, the pressing factor for most of us is that we are not invited, and the iPhone is the worst affected of Apple’s devices. To use Apple Intelligence, you need an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. A regular iPhone 15 won’t do, meaning a mobile well under a year old is, at least in this specific sense, obsolete. Mac users just need an Apple Silicon computer, meaning one released in 2020 or newer. A more cynical take on this is that these exclusion timescales are tied to the average upgrade cycle of phones and laptops. A person might be considered normal if they upgrade their phone every year. Buying a new laptop every year means you are probably foolish, a theft-magnet, or just plain clumsy. The reality is a lot more complicated. The computation required for at least some parts of Apple Intelligence is quite different to that of the average iPhone or Mac task. And this has all been obscured to the average generative AI or chatbot dabbler so far because of the way all of us have been introduced to the form. When you use ChatGPT, Midjourney, or even Adobe Photoshop’s Generative Fill feature, your own computer is doing almost none of the real work. That is done on remote cloud servers, which perform the necessary calculations then simply beam the final result over to your phone or laptop. In this sense, generative AI to date has been rather like a digital assistant, such as Siri or Alexa. It can, at times, do great stuff. But little to none of it is really happening on the device on which it is used. Apple Intelligence will try, at least in part, to change that. Why? “You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone’s AI cloud,” said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, during Apple's announcement of the new features. “The cornerstone of the personal intelligence system is on-device processing. We have integrated it deep into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and throughout your apps, so it’s aware of your personal data without collecting your personal data.” By Christopher Solomon By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano By Adrienne So On-device AI processing is a privacy play, a classic Apple strategy. But it’s not the first to make this move. Microsoft was. Its Copilot+ standard is a similar concept, but based solely around laptops. Copilot+ laptops have dedicated AI hardware designed to allow for on-device AI processing. The two even rely heavily on the same core artificial intelligence, that of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Which leads us to this completely justified question: Why the hell can’t my $900 iPhone 15 do this stuff too? NPU is the term: the tech under the spotlight that separates older “non-AI” hardware from the new stuff our purses are meant to quiver in anticipation for. It stands for “neural processing unit.” The latest phones and tablets have one of these in addition to the CPU (central processing unit) and the GPU (graphics processing unit). Its specialization is in carrying out an awful lot of operations simultaneously—and in the context of phones and laptops, doing so while using minimal power is key. Just as generative AI has pebble-dashed the internet and wider society with what might charitably be called “stuff,” the creation of that stuff also requires a wide and shallow type of work. For those who want to get slightly more technical, NPUs excel at matrix manipulation. This is the core form of work that powers chatbot LLMs and other generative AI. In each case, an AI starts off with a prompt and gradually homes in on a final result—be it a picture or a sentence of prose—through matrix manipulation. Case closed? Are we simply in an NPU world now? Sure, but we have been since at least 2017. Apple introduced the Apple ANE (Apple Neural Engine) in 2017, seen in the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. It’s an NPU. It was needed back then, years before AI was as much of a buzzword as it is today, because Apple has actually used forms of AI and machine learning in iOS for ages. Perhaps Apple Intelligence isn’t all that different—there’s just more of it. And the software scene has already proved some of these new “AI” features are being artificially gated, paywalled, behind new hardware. A hobbyist software historian who goes by the name of Albacore online has got some of Microsoft’s Copilot+ features working on hardware that shouldn’t, in theory, be able to run it—a cheap Samsung Galaxy Book2 Go notebook. It costs a fifth to a quarter of the price of a Copilot+ laptop. “Getting Recall working was moderately challenging, I suppose. I've been reverse engineering Windows bits for close to 10 years, so tracking down checks and restrictions is practically second nature to me,” Albacore tells WIRED. How does it work? “Track down what guards the features, devise a plan for altering the check so it's always happy no matter the real requirements, and then wrap it in a nice installer. Some testing and edge case hunting later, the app was ready,” Albacore says. By Christopher Solomon By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano By Adrienne So You can read about how to get it working yourself in an article over at Tom’s Hardware. “I'd say Recall works nicely even on older, less powerful hardware—the only aspect where you can notice lag is searching across the timeline,” says Albacore. Recall is the most contentious, and headline pick, of Microsoft’s new AI features. Much like the new version of Siri, it can access your past actions, browsing history, and emails to turn Windows’ Universal search into something closer to an omniscient PA. The part that doesn’t work so well on the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Go is Cocreator in the Paint app, Microsoft’s generative equivalent to the many image-generation features in Apple Intelligence. “You can see the image generation process spin up and take a lot of resources, but it still crashes in the end, unfortunately. Perhaps an equally old chip but with more RAM would fare better, but I don't have that at my disposal at the moment,” says Albacore. RAM: This may be the crux of why recent iPhones don't support Apple Intelligence even though they have as much AI and machine learning power as a MacBook that does support it. According to the Geekbench benchmarking tool, an iPhone 14 actually has a more powerful NPU AI chipset than an M1 MacBook. However, those older phones have only 6 GB of RAM. All iPhones on the Apple Intelligence guest list have 8 GB of RAM. Why does RAM matter? When AI models are run locally rather than in the cloud, they have to be stored in RAM or vRAM, the graphics card equivalent. Even the fastest SSD drives are not nearly fast enough for the job. A lot of fanfare was made about the PlayStation 5’s 5,000 MB per second SSD, and how it let game developers stream visual assets off storage in real time. The DDR5 RAM in the average PC can reach bandwidth of up to 64 GB per second, while the fastest of Nvidia’s cards made for machine learning and AI, the H200, has a 4.8 TB per second bandwidth. That is almost 1,000 times higher than the transfer rate of the PS5 SSD. The Nvidia H200 and its predecessors also provide handy context that should bring expectations for the iPhone 16’s offline AI abilities back into line. These graphics cards power the servers that perform the cloud AI computing required for all our frivolous ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion requests. They have up to 141 GB of vRAM per card, and cost tens of thousands of dollars a piece. And you need a bunch of them to house the latest GPT-4 backend intelligence—hundreds of GB of vRAM in total is necessary. We’re miles away from consumer tech stuff here. Even the consumer-grade Nvidia RTX gaming cards are going to be far more adept at most AI tasks than this new supposedly-made-for-AI hardware. “GeForce RTX GPUs are ideal for AI PC users looking for the best AI experience,” says Jesse Clayton, Nvidia’s director of PC AI. “They deliver the fastest AI performance, up to 1,300 TOPS, and the most mature AI software stack, and accelerate more than 500 AI-enabled applications and games.” By Christopher Solomon By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano By Adrienne So For reference, Microsoft Copilot+ PCs set the benchmark at just 45 TOPS, which stands for trillions of operations per second. The iPhone 15 Pro Max can afford maybe 2 to 4 GB of RAM, and its NPU is rated at 35 TOPS. Whatever features Apple Intelligence can use offline will have to be based on a small, relatively simple AI model. Apple’s own website tells us that Sharing Suggestions, Memories, and scene recognition in Photos are “on-device,” as are Siri Suggestions, voice recognition, and transcription. A little logic suggests all the generative AI stuff primed to get people excited, and steal all the jobs kids once dreamed of having, can’t be done locally on an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Or an iPhone 16 Pro Max, come to that. And what’s left starts to look an awful lot like features other phones have already, or similar to what Albacore has managed to get working on modest NPU-free hardware. The next question is whether the iPhone 16 will even get the full suite of Apple Intelligence features, or whether it will continue to be used as a Pro-series upsell in the next generation. The first Apple Intelligence features will be available later this year on the public release of iOS 18, expected to land in September alongside the iPhone 16. We'll find out then."
61,Will Knight,Apple Intelligence Will Infuse the iPhone With Generative AI,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-ios-wwdc/,"At its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced its first serious foray into generative AI, with a focus on app integrations and data privacy.",2024-06-10T18:34:53Z,"Will Knight Apple is finally getting into the generative artificial intelligence game—with a little help from an unlikely partner in OpenAI. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced Apple’s long-awaited AI reboot at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference in Cupertino, California, today. What the company is calling Apple Intelligence, available in beta this fall, includes a handful of features that will shape the iPhone, iPad, and Mac experiences in ways large and small. Apple also gave Siri, its currently-limited voice assistant, a significant generative AI overhaul. The company also announced that it will incorporate outside AI models into its software, starting with OpenAI’s ChatGPT later this year, making clear that the experience will be opt-in only and won’t require a ChatGPT subscription. Siri will determine whether a query can benefit from accessing ChatGPT, and then ask for approval to share information with the model. Apple said it would tap into other AI models in the future as well. “We’re excited to partner with Apple to bring ChatGPT to their users in a new way,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a statement. “Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI’s mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone.” Until now, Apple has been conspicuously absent from headlines about generative AI. Competitors like Google and Microsoft have rushed to embrace the technology ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022. Apple has apparently been biding its time, developing a comprehensive strategy that touches on many of its products and services. Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, said the company’s new AI strategy will focus on privacy and security. In addition to stressing privacy-friendly, on-device AI use cases, Federighi introduced what the company calls Private Cloud Compute, a technology that claims to protect data even for more intensive AI tasks that necessitate the cloud. “Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,” he said. Apple showed off Apple Intelligence across numerous apps. A feature called Writing Tools, available systemwide, can clean up your text for grammar and readability, and adjust the tone to be more friendly or more professional. Apple's so-called Image Playground will let you create images across Apple like in Messages and Notes, including AI-generated images of contacts in three different styles: sketch, illustration, and animation. You'll also be able to create custom emoji with generative AI, a feature Apple calls Genmoji. And an AI refresh to Siri will make the assistant better able to handle complex spoken commands and better able to search for information even if a command is ambiguous. Apple will also offer smaller generative AI algorithms that run on devices. It says these algorithms will be snappier and better protect users’ data. The company will face a balancing act in emphasizing privacy and security while also pivoting to greater use of generative AI. It had been widely rumored ahead of WWDC that Apple was working on a deal with OpenAI. On the face of it, Apple and OpenAI would seem particularly unlikely bedfellows. Apple tends to move cautiously and carefully when delivering new products, emphasizing attention to detail, obsession with the user experience, and stunning design. OpenAI is best known for throwing a powerful but experimental new AI technology into the world and watching what people do with it. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The OpenAI deal could make a lot of sense for Apple though, as it seeks to jumpstart its use of large language models. Allowing Siri to tap OpenAI’s chatbot will ensure users can access the most advanced offering on the market while reducing its own reputational risk if things go awry with the most challenging queries. The strategy will also buy Apple time while its own AI models catch up to what OpenAI can offer today. “With Apple’s announcement, all the technology giants have now staked out their initial strategies for generative AI,” says Andy Wu, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who studies tech companies’ use of AI. Wu says that despite being relatively late to the game, Apple has a significant opportunity because of its vast user base. However, Wu says that the cost of running powerful generative AI models along with managing their tendency to fabricate information will pose new challenges for the company. “Deploying the technology today requires incurring those risks, and doing so would be at odds with Apple’s traditional inclination toward offering polished products that it has full control over,” he says. For now, though, Apple has at least made its AI strategy known. Now all it has to do is see that plan through—without hitting the pitfalls that have vexed every other tech giant so far."
62,Ray Kurzweil,The Secret to Living Past 120 Years Old? Nanobots,https://www.wired.com/story/the-singularity-is-nearer-book-ray-kurzweil/,"In The Singularity Is Nearer: When We Merge With AI, the spiritual sequel to his (in)famous first book, Ray Kurzweil doubles down on the promise of immortality.",2024-06-13T10:00:00Z,"By Ray Kurzweil We are now in the later stages of the first generation of life extension, which involves applying the current class of pharmaceutical and nutritional knowledge to overcoming health challenges. In the 2020s we are starting the second phase of life extension, which is the merger of biotechnology with AI. The 2030s will usher in the third phase of life extension, which will be to use nanotechnology to overcome the limitations of our biological organs altogether. As we enter this phase, we’ll greatly extend our lives, allowing people to far transcend the normal human limit of 120 years.

Only one person, Jeanne Calment—a French woman who survived to age 122—is documented to have lived longer than 120 years. So why is this such a hard limit to human longevity? One might guess that the reasons people don’t make it past this age are statistical—that elderly people face a certain risk of Alzheimer’s, stroke, heart attack, or cancer every year, and that after enough years being exposed to these risks, everyone eventually dies of something. But that’s not what’s happening. Actuarial data shows that from age 90 to 110, a person’s chances of dying in the following year increase by about 2 percentage points annually. For example, an American man at age 97 has about a 30 percent chance of dying before 98, and if he makes it that far he will have a 32 percent chance of dying before 99. But from age 110 onward, the risk of death rises by about 3.5 percentage points a year. Doctors have offered an explanation: At around age 110, the bodies of the oldest people start breaking down in ways that are qualitatively different from the aging of younger senior citizens. Supercentenarian (110-plus) aging is not simply a continuation or worsening of the same kinds of statistical risks of late adulthood. While people at that age also have an annual risk from ordinary diseases (although the worsening of these risks may decelerate in the very old), they additionally face new challenges like kidney failure and respiratory failure. These often seem to happen spontaneously—not as a result of lifestyle factors or any disease onset. The body apparently just starts breaking down. Over the past decade, scientists and investors have started giving much more serious attention to finding out why. One of the leading researchers in this field is biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey, founder of the LEV (Longevity Escape Velocity) foundation. As de Grey explains, aging is like the wear on the engine of an automobile—it is damage that accumulates as a result of the system’s normal operation. In the human body’s case, that damage largely comes from a combination of cellular metabolism and cellular reproduction. Metabolism creates waste in and around cells and damages structures through oxidation (much like the rusting of a car!). When we’re young, our bodies are able to remove this waste and repair the damage efficiently. But as we get older, most of our cells reproduce over and over, and errors accumulate. Eventually the damage starts piling up faster than the body can fix it. The only solution, longevity researchers argue, is to cure aging itself. In short, we need the ability to repair damage from aging at the level of individual cells and local tissues. There are a number of possibilities being explored for how to achieve this, but I believe the most promising ultimate solution is nanorobots. And we don’t need to wait until these technologies are fully mature in order to benefit. If you can live long enough for anti-aging research to start adding at least one year to your remaining life expectancy annually, that will buy enough time for nanomedicine to cure any remaining facets of aging. This is longevity escape velocity. This is why there is sound logic behind Aubrey de Grey’s sensational declaration that the first person to live to 1,000 years has likely already been born. If the nanotechnology of 2050 solves enough issues of aging for 100-year-olds to start living to 150, we’ll then have until 2100 to solve whatever new problems may crop up at that age. With AI playing a key role in research by then, progress during that time will be exponential. So even though these projections are admittedly startling—and even sound absurd to our intuitive for linear thinking—we have solid reasons to see this as a likely future. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams I’ve had many conversations over the years about life extension, and the idea often meets resistance. People become upset when they hear of an individual whose life has been cut short by a disease, yet when confronted with the possibility of generally extending all human life, they react negatively. “Life is too difficult to contemplate going on indefinitely” is a common response. But people generally do not want to end their lives at any point unless they are in enormous pain—physically, mentally, or spiritually. And if they were to absorb the ongoing improvements of life in all its dimensions, most such afflictions would be alleviated. That is, extending human life would also mean vastly improving it. But how will nanotechnology actually make this possible? In my view, the long-term goal is medical nanorobots. These will be made from diamondoid parts with onboard sensors, manipulators, computers, communicators, and possibly power supplies. It is intuitive to imagine nanobots as tiny metal robotic submarines chugging through the bloodstream, but physics at the nanoscale requires a substantially different approach. At this scale, water is a powerful solvent, and oxidant molecules are highly reactive, so strong materials like diamondoid will be needed. And whereas macro-scale submarines can smoothly propel themselves through liquids, for nanoscale objects, fluid dynamics are dominated by sticky frictional forces. Imagine trying to swim through peanut butter! So nanobots will need to harness different principles of propulsion. Likewise, nanobots probably won’t be able to store enough onboard energy or computing power to accomplish all their tasks independently, so they will need to be designed to draw energy from their surroundings and either obey outside control signals or collaborate with one another to do computation. To maintain our bodies and otherwise counteract health problems, we will all need a huge number of nanobots, each about the size of a cell. The best available estimates say that the human body is made of several tens of trillions of biological cells. If we augment ourselves with just 1 nanobot per 100 cells, this would amount to several hundred billion nanobots. It remains to be seen, though, what ratio is optimal. It might turn out, for example, that advanced nanobots could be effective even at a cell-to-nanobot ratio several orders of magnitude greater. One of the main effects of aging is degrading organ performance, so a key role of these nanobots will be to repair and augment them. Other than expanding our neocortex, this will mainly involve helping our nonsensory organs to efficiently place substances into the blood supply (or lymph system) or remove them. By monitoring the supply of these vital substances, adjusting their levels as needed, and maintaining organ structures, nanobots can keep a person’s body in good health indefinitely. Ultimately, nanobots will be able to replace biological organs altogether, if needed or desired. But nanobots won’t be limited to preserving the body’s normal function. They could also be used to adjust concentrations of various substances in our blood to levels more optimal than what would normally occur in the body. Hormones could be tweaked to give us more energy and focus, or speed up the body’s natural healing and repair. If optimizing hormones could make our sleep more efficient, it would in effect be “backdoor life extension.” If you just go from needing eight hours of sleep a night to seven hours, that adds as much waking existence to the average life as five more years of lifespan! By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Eventually, using nanobots for body maintenance and optimization should prevent major diseases from even arising. Once nanobots can selectively repair or destroy individual cells, we will fully master our biology, and medicine will become the exact science it has long aspired to be. Achieving this will also entail gaining complete control over our genes. In our natural state, cells reproduce by copying the DNA in each nucleus. If there is a problem with the DNA sequence in a group of cells, there is no way to address it without updating it in every individual cell. This is an advantage in unenhanced biological organisms, because random mutations within individual cells are unlikely to cause fatal damage to the whole body. If any mutation in any cell in our bodies were instantly copied to every other cell, we wouldn’t be able to survive. But the decentralized robustness of biology is a major challenge to a species (like ours) that can edit individual cells’ DNA fairly well but has not yet mastered the nanotechnology needed to edit DNA effectively throughout the whole body. If instead each cell’s DNA code were controlled by a central server (as many electronic systems are), then we could change the DNA code by simply updating it once from that “central server.” To do this, we would augment each cell’s nucleus with a nanoengineered counterpart—a system that would receive the DNA code from the central server and then produce a sequence of amino acids from this code. I use “central server” here as a shorthand for a more centralized broadcast architecture, but this probably does not mean every nanobot getting direct instructions from literally one computer. The physical challenges of nanoscale engineering might ultimately dictate that a more localized broadcast system is preferable. But even if there are hundreds or thousands of micro-scale (as opposed to nanoscale) control units placed around our bodies (which would be large enough for more complex communications with an overall control computer), this would be orders of magnitude more centralization than the status quo: independent functioning by tens of trillions of cells. The other parts of the protein synthesis system, such as the ribosome, could be augmented in the same fashion. In this way we could simply turn off activity from malfunctioning DNA, whether it is responsible for cancer or genetic disorders. The nanocomputer maintaining this process would also implement the biological algorithms that govern epigenetics—how genes are expressed and activated. As of the early 2020s, we still have a lot to learn about gene expression, but AI will allow us to simulate it in enough detail by the time nanotechnology is mature that nanobots will be able to precisely regulate it. With this technology we’ll also be able to prevent and reverse the accumulation of DNA transcription errors, which are a major cause of aging. Nanobots will also be useful for neutralizing urgent threats to the body—destroying bacteria and viruses, halting autoimmune reactions, or drilling through clogged arteries. In fact, recent research by Stanford and Michigan State University has already created a nanoparticle that finds the monocytes and macrophages that cause atherosclerotic plaque and eliminates those cells. Smart nanobots will be vastly more effective. Initially such treatments would be initiated by humans, but ultimately they will be carried out autonomously; the nanobots will perform tasks on their own and report their activities (via a controlling AI interface) to humans monitoring them. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams As AI gains greater ability to understand human biology, it will be possible to send nanobots to address problems at the cellular level long before they would be detectable by today’s doctors. In many cases this will allow prevention of conditions that remain unexplained in 2023. Today, for example, about 25 percent of ischemic strokes are “cryptogenic”—they have no detectable cause. But we know they must happen for some reason. Nanobots patrolling the bloodstream could detect small plaques or structural defects at risk of creating stroke-causing clots, break up forming clots, or raise the alarm if a stroke is silently unfolding. Just as with hormone optimization, though, nanomaterials will allow us to not just restore normal body function but augment it beyond what our biology alone makes possible. Biological systems are limited in strength and speed because they must be constructed from protein. Although these proteins are three-dimensional, they have to be folded from a one-dimensional string of amino acids. Engineered nanomaterials won’t have this limitation. Nanobots built from diamondoid gears and rotors would be thousands of times faster and stronger than biological materials, and designed from scratch to perform optimally. Thanks to these advantages, even our blood supply may be replaced by nanobots. A design by founding Singularity University nanotechnology cochair Robert A. Freitas called the respirocyte is an artificial red blood cell. According to Freitas’ calculations, someone with respirocytes in his bloodstream could hold his breath for about four hours. In addition to artificial blood cells, we’ll eventually be able to engineer artificial lungs to oxygenate them more efficiently than the respiratory system that biology has given us. Ultimately, even hearts made from nanomaterials will make people immune to heart attacks and make cardiac arrest due to trauma much rarer. Yet the most important role of nanotech in our bodies will be augmenting the brain—which will eventually become more than 99.9 percent nonbiological. There are two distinct pathways by which this will happen. One is the gradual introduction of nanobots to the brain tissue itself. These may be used to repair damage or replace neurons that have stopped working. The other is connecting the brain to computers, which will both provide the ability to control machines directly with our thoughts and allow us to integrate digital layers of neocortex in the cloud. This will go far beyond just better memory or faster thinking. A deeper virtual neocortex will give us the ability to think thoughts more complex and abstract than we can currently comprehend. As a dimly suggestive example, imagine being able to clearly and intuitively visualize and reason about 10-dimensional shapes. That sort of facility will be possible across many domains of cognition. For comparison, the cerebral cortex (which is mainly made up of the neocortex) has an average of 16 billion neurons, in a volume of roughly half a liter. Ralph Merkle’s design for a nanoscale mechanical computing system could theoretically pack more than 80 quintillion logic gates into the same amount of space. And the speed advantage would be enormous: The electrochemical switching speed of mammalian neuron firing probably averages within an order of magnitude of once per second, as compared with likely around 100 million to 1 billion cycles per second for nanoengineered computation. Even if only a minuscule fraction of these values are achievable in practice, it is clear that such technology will allow the digital parts of our brain (stored on nonbiological computing substrates) to vastly outnumber and outperform the biological ones. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams My estimate is that the computations inside the human brain (at the level of neurons) is on the order of 1014 per second. As of early 2023, $1,000 of computing power could perform up to 48 trillion computations per second. Based on the 2000–2022 trend, by 2053 about $1,000 of computing power (in 2023 dollars) will be enough to perform more than 1 million times as many computations per second as the unenhanced human brain. If it turns out, as I suspect, that only a fraction of the brain’s neurons are necessary to digitize the conscious mind (e.g., if we don’t have to simulate the actions of many cells that govern the actions of the body’s other organs), this point could be reached several years sooner. And even if it turns out that digitizing our conscious minds requires simulating every protein in every neuron (which I think is unlikely), it might take a few more decades to reach that level of affordability—but it’s still something that would happen within the lifetimes of many people living today. In other words, because this future depends on fundamental exponential trends, even if we greatly change our assumptions about how easy it will be to affordably digitize ourselves, that won’t vastly change the date by which this milestone will be reached. In the 2040s and 2050s, we will rebuild our bodies and brains to go vastly beyond what our biological bodies are capable of, including their backup and survival. As nanotechnology takes off, we will be able to produce an optimized body at will: We’ll be able to run much faster and longer, swim and breathe under the ocean like fish, and even give ourselves working wings if we want them. We will think millions of times faster, but most importantly, we will not be dependent on the survival of any of our bodies for our selves to survive.

63,Louryn Strampe,How to Shop Like a Pro During Amazon Prime Day - July 2024,https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-prime-day-2024-tips-to-find-best-deals/,We’ve got tips to help you cut through the clutter to find real Amazon Prime Day deals.,2024-06-15T13:13:00Z,"Louryn Strampe Amazon Prime Day is arguably one of the most confusing shopping holidays in existence. It’s not even a “day”—the members-only event spans 48 hours. Amazon also promises “millions of deals,” but the displayed discounts are often misleading—or outright false. Some deals are actually available to people who don’t subscribe to Prime. Add in the frenzy of limited-time Lightning Deals and you’ve got a recipe perfect for spending too much money. Fear not! We’re here to help. WIRED’s Gear team is familiar with common shopping pitfalls, and I’ve been a deals writer for nearly a decade. What time do sales start and end? How do you tell whether a deal is actually a deal? We pooled our collective knowledge to get you prepared for Amazon Prime Day. Updated June 2024: We've updated this story with additional details about Prime Day, which is set for sometime in July 2024. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Amazon has officially announced that Prime Day will be held in July. We believe, based on past sales, that Prime Day 2024 will take place on a Tuesday and Wednesday sometime in the middle of the month. The event officially begins at 3 am Eastern time and runs for 48 hours. WIRED will cover the best Prime Day deals from both Amazon and retailers that have competing sales. Some deals and sales will begin ahead of the official start time. (We'll be covering those too.) Officially, yes. You must be an Amazon Prime member to shop for Amazon's Prime Day deals. There is a free 30-day trial available for new accounts. (Prime membership comes with a lot of perks, and we've rounded up all of them here.) The trial will let you get in on the sale—just remember to cancel your membership to avoid any subsequent renewal charges. There are some discounts available if you're not a subscriber (those deals might not be that great). But other major retailers like Best Buy and Target usually hold concurrent sales during Prime-exclusive sales events. Their prices are often close to what Amazon is offering on the same products, and sometimes they match the price. This is a good way to take part in the Prime Day Sale if you don’t want to support Amazon. Walmart is launching a rival Walmart+ Plus Week sales event for members, running June 17–23, 2024. Like Amazon Prime, Walmart+ gives you free express delivery and some other perks, but costs just $98 per year. The deals include 20 cents off a gallon of gas at Exxon & Mobil stations nationwide, so you could pay off your entire annual Walmart+ membership by buying just 490 gallons of gas! It depends. For some items, Prime member-exclusive event prices tend to be some of the lowest we see all year. That's especially true for Amazon hardware, like Kindles, Fire Tablets, Fire TV Sticks, and Echo devices, but there are other factors to consider. Prices fluctuate throughout the year, and some products are discounted quite often. Even if the price is good, a deal on a product that goes on sale all the time diminishes the overall quality of that deal. The sheer volume of deals promoted by Amazon during sales like Prime Day is a blessing and a curse. The truly good discounts can be difficult to pinpoint—there's so much stuff on sale that the overall selection can feel overwhelming. But there's a good chance that the item you want will be on sale. We've seen some fantastic Prime-exclusive discounts in the past, ranging from dirt-cheap Kindles to elusive price drops on the Nintendo Switch. The tricky part is to find the diamonds in the rough. WIRED covers legitimately good deals all year long, including during the Prime Day event. Our tips below will help you find those great discounts on your own. ABC: Always be checking (prices, that is). Researching an item's price is the most important aspect of determining the quality of a discount. Don't fall prey to deceptive marketing language and inflated MSRP prices—our tips only take a few moments. The easiest step is to take a second to Google the items you're considering so you can see the price across multiple stores. One tool we like to use is Camelcamelcamel, which tracks Amazon's prices over time. Paste the Amazon link or ASIN (found in the Product Information section on the Amazon product page) into Camelcamelcamel's search bar and you'll be able to see an item's lowest recorded price, its average price, and how frequently the price fluctuates. Some deals, such as Lightning Deals, are excluded from the pricing history, but it's useful to see what an item has sold for in the past. We also like Keepa, which has an extension (available for multiple browsers) that shows the recent price history for products directly on the Amazon page so you don't have to open a new tab. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Keep in mind that these services may not work all the time. But being able to see how much a product costs right before the sale starts (and whether the MSRP happened to increase) can be helpful. Putting these tools together can help you deduce whether a deal is worth your money. WIRED always fact-checks deals to determine their quality. You can check out our ongoing deals coverage to find roundups of the best discounts available—during Prime Day and year-round. Lightning Deals are limited-time deals that Amazon runs for only a few hours. They're not restricted to Prime Day, but they're especially prevalent during big sales events. Once an item sells out, you may be able to join a waiting list, but not always. Put bluntly, the Lightning Deals selection is often full of impulse buys, like makeup and skin-care products or toys. Prime members can browse upcoming deals on Amazon's website and in the mobile app. The app can also alert you before a Lightning Deal begins. We'll share some of our favorite Lightning Deals in a live blog during the event this year. The best deals sometimes sell out quickly. To get around this, Amazon launched an invite-only deals program during Prime Day a few years ago. Prime members can request an invitation on items that are expected to sell out. This feature is only available on select products, but it's spread across a wide range of price points and categories—including kitchen, electronics, fashion, and beauty. On the page, you'll see a Request Invite button on the right-hand side. Click it to get a chance to buy it at the sale price, but there's no guarantee you'll be invited. According to an Amazon spokesperson, the company removes “bot-like submissions” from the list of requests and selects from the remaining customers. However, it's not clear how Amazon chooses from the remaining list of interested buyers. If you're selected, you'll receive both an email and a notification via the Amazon app once Prime Day begins. The deal is valid until Prime Day ends—so you'll have to purchase the specific product before the two-day event comes to a close. If you know what time a deal begins, make sure to actively pay attention to the product page around the starting time. You may also be able to add an item to your cart before the sale begins, so you can refresh the page to snag it right away. With the Amazon Shopping app (Android, iOS), you can set up personalized deals alerts to get notified when items you have searched for recently are on sale, but only if you're a Prime member. It's smart to create an account at trusted retailers so you can save your credit card information and shipping details ahead of time. This will make the checkout process as fast as possible. It's also a good idea to clear your web browser cache before you start shopping during sales events like Prime Day. Just be sure to log back into those retailers afterward. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano If a deal does sell out, there's a high chance that another store will be offering a similar or matching discount. Check other stores, especially big-box merchants like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Sometimes expired deals can come back in stock too. It's easy to fall into a trap during events like Prime Day or other shopping holidays. You might see a great deal on a product you don't really need. Don't do it. Make a list of items you've actually been wanting to buy ahead of the event and save those links. When Prime Day begins, take a look around to see whether they're on sale, and use the aforementioned practices to make sure it truly is a good deal. Then buy it! Don't buy a product just because it has a nice price. This isn't your only chance to score a great deal this year. The last big sale event of the year is Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which takes place on Thanksgiving weekend. You might see even better price drops then. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

64,Luca Zorloni,The EU Is Taking on Big Tech. It May Be Outmatched,https://www.wired.com/story/european-commission-big-tech-regulation-outlook/,"From the Digital Services Act to the AI Act, in five years Europe has created a lot of rules for the digital world. Implementing them, however, isn’t always easy.",2024-06-09T08:00:00Z,"Luca Zorloni This story originally appeared in WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian. The latest in a series of duels announced by the European Commission is with Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Brussels suspects that the giant based in Redmond, Washington, has failed to properly moderate content produced by the generative AI systems on Bing, Copilot, and Image Creator, and that as a result, it may have violated the Digital Services Act (DSA), one of Europe’s latest digital regulations. On May 17, the EU summit requested company documents to understand how Microsoft handled the spread of hallucinations (inaccurate or nonsensical answers produced by AI), deepfakes, and attempts to improperly influence the upcoming European Parliament elections. At the beginning of June, voters in the 27 states of the European Union will choose their representatives to the European Parliament, in a campaign over which looms the ominous shadow of technology with its potential to manipulate the outcome. The commission has given Microsoft until May 27 to respond, only days before voters go to the polls. If there is a need to correct course, it may likely be too late. Over the past few months, the European Commission has started to bang its fists on the table when dealing with the big digital giants, almost all of them based in the US or China. This isn’t the first time. In 2022, the European Union hit Google with a fine of €4.1 billion because of its market dominance thanks to its Android system, marking the end of an investigation that started in 2015. In 2023, it sanctioned Meta with a fine of €1.2 billion for violating the GDPR, the EU’s data protection regulations. And in March it presented Apple with a sanction of €1.8 billion. Recently, however, there appears to have been a change in strategy. Sanctions continue to be available as a last resort when Big Tech companies don’t bend to the wishes of Brussels, but now the European Commission is aiming to take a closer look at Big Tech, find out how it operates, and modify it as needed, before imposing fines. Take, for example, Europe’s Digital Services Act, which attempts to impose transparency in areas like algorithms and advertising, fight online harassment and disinformation, protect minors, stop user profiling, and eliminate dark patterns (design features intended to manipulate our choices on the web). In 2023, Brussels identified 22 multinationals that, due to their size, would be the focus of its initial efforts: Google with its four major services (search, shopping, maps, and play), YouTube, Meta with Instagram and Facebook, Bing, X (formerly Twitter), Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Amazon, Booking, Wikipedia, Apple’s App Store, TikTok, Alibaba, Zalando, and the porn sites Pornhub, XVideos, and Stripchat. Since then, it has been putting the pressure on these companies to cooperate with its regulatory regime. The day before the Bing investigation was announced, the commission also opened one into Meta to determine what the multinational is doing to protect minors on Facebook and Instagram and counter the “rabbit hole” effect—that is, the seamless flood of content that demands users’ attention, and which can be especially appealing to younger people. That same concern led it to block the launch of TikTok Lite in Europe, deeming its system for rewarding social engagement dangerous and a means of encouraging addictive behavior. It has asked X to increase its content moderation, LinkedIn to explain how its ad system works, and AliExpress to defend its refund and complaint processes. On one hand, the message appears to be that no one will escape the reach of Brussels. On the other, the European Commission, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, has to demonstrate that the many digital laws and regulations that are in place actually produce positive results. In addition to the DSA, there is the Digital Markets Act (DMA), intended to counterbalance the dominance of Big Tech in online markets; the AI Act, Europe’s flagship legislation on artificial intelligence; and the Data Governance Act (DGA) and the Data Act, which address data protection and the use of data in the public and private sectors. Also to be added to the list are the updated cybersecurity package, NIS2 (Network and Information Security); the Digital Operational Resilience Act, focused on finance and insurance; and the digital identity package within eIDAS 2. Still in the draft stage are regulations on health data spaces and much-debated chat measures which would authorize law enforcement agencies and platforms to scan citizens’ private messages, looking for child pornography. Brussels has deployed its heavy artillery against the digital flagships of the United States and China, and a few successful blows have landed, such as ByteDance’s suspension of the gamification feature on TikTok Lite following its release in France and Spain. But the future is uncertain and complicated. While investigations attract media interest, the EU’s digital bureaucracy is a large and complex machine to run. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams On February 17, the DSA became law for all online service operators (cloud and hosting providers, search engines, e-commerce, and online services) but the European Commission doesn’t and can’t control everything. That is why it asked states to appoint a local authority to serve as a coordinator of digital services. Five months later, Brussels had to send a formal notice to six states (Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia) to urge them to designate and fully empower their digital services coordinators. Those countries now have two months to comply before Brussels will intervene. But there are others who are also not in the clear. For example, Italy’s digital services coordinator, the Communications Regulatory Authority (abbreviated AGCOM, for Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni, in Italian), needs to recruit 23 new employees to replenish its staff. The department told WIRED Italy that it expects to have filled all of its appointments by mid-June. The DSA also introduced “trusted flaggers.” These are individuals or entities, such as universities, associations, and fact-checkers, committed to combating online hatred, internet harassment, illegal content, and the spread of scams and fake news. Their reports are, one hopes, trustworthy. The selection of trusted flaggers is up to local authorities but, to date, only Finland has formalized the appointment of one, specifically Tekijänoikeuden tiedotus- ja valvontakeskus ry (in English, the Copyright Information and Anti-Piracy Center). Its executive director, Jaana Pihkala, explained to WIRED Italy that their task is “to produce reports on copyright infringements,” a subject on which the association has 40 years of experience. Since its appointment as a trusted flagger, the center’s two lawyers, who perform all of its functions, have sent 816 alerts to protect films, TV series, and books on behalf of Finnish copyright holders. To assure that the new commission is respected by the 27 states, the commission set up the DSA surveillance system as quickly as possible, but the bureaucrats in Brussels still have a formidable amount of research to do. On the one hand, there is the anonymous reporting platform with which the commission hopes to build dossiers on the operations of different platforms directly from internal sources. The biggest scandals that have shaken Meta have been thanks to former employees, like Christopher Wylie, the analyst who revealed how Cambridge Analytica attempted to influence the US elections, and Frances Haugen, who shared documents about the impacts of Instagram and Facebook on children’s health. The DSA, however, intends to empower and fund the commission so that it can have its own people capable of sifting through documents and data, analyzing the content, and deciding whether to act. The commission boasts that the DSA will force platforms to be transparent. And indeed it can point to some successes already, for example, by revealing the absurdly inadequate numbers of moderators employed by platforms. According to the latest data released last November, they don’t even cover all the languages spoken in the European Union. X reported that it had only two people to check content in Italian, the language of 9.1 million users. There were no moderators for Greek, Finnish, or Romanian even though each language has more than 2 million subscribers. AliExpress moderates everything in English while, for other languages, it makes do with automatic translators. LinkedIn moderates content in 12 languages of the European bloc—that is, just half of the official languages. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams At the same time, the commission has forced large platforms to standardize their reports of moderation interventions to feed a large database, which, at the time of writing this article, contains more than 18.2 billion records. Of these cases, 69 percent were handled automatically. But, perhaps surprisingly, 92 percent concerned Google Shopping. This is because the platform uses various parameters to determine whether a product can be featured: the risk that it is counterfeited, possible violations of site standards, prohibited goods, dangerous materials, and others. It can thus be the case that several alerts are triggered for the same product and the DSA database counts each one separately, multiplying the shopping numbers exponentially. So now the EU has a mass of data that further complicates its goal of being fully transparent. And then there’s the Big Tech companies’ legal battle against the fee they have to pay to the commission to help underwrite its supervisory bodies. Meta, TikTok, and Zalando have challenged the fee (though paid it). Zalando is also the only European company on the commission’s list of large platforms, a designation Zalando has always contested because it does not believe it meets the criteria used by Brussels. One example: The platforms on the list must have at least 45 million monthly users in Europe. The commission argues that Zalando has 83 million users, though that number, for example, includes visits from Portugal, where the platform is not marketed, and Zalando argues those users should be deducted from its total count. According to its calculations, the activities subject to the DSA reach only 31 million users, under the threshold. When Zalando was assessed its fee, it discovered that the commission had based it on a figure of 47.5 million users, far below the initial 83 million. The company has now taken the commission to court in an attempt to assure a transparent process. And this is just one piece of legislation, the DSA. The commission has also deployed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a package of regulations to counterbalance Big Tech’s market dominance, requiring that certain services be interoperable with those of other companies, that apps that come loaded on a device by default can be uninstalled, and that data collected on large platforms be shared with small- and medium-size companies. Again, the push to impose these mandates starts with the giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, ByteDance, and Microsoft. In May, Booking was added to the list. Platforms have started to respond to EU requests, with lukewarm results. WhatsApp, for instance, has been redesigned to allow chatting with other apps without compromising its end-to-end encryption that protects the privacy and security of users, but it is still unclear who will agree to connect to it. WIRED US reached out to 10 messaging companies, including Google, Telegram, Viber, and Signal, to ask whether they intend to look at interoperability and whether they had worked with WhatsApp on its plans. The majority didn’t respond to the request for comment. Those that did, Snap and Discord, said they had nothing to add. Apple had to accept sideloading—i.e., the possibility of installing and updating iPhone or iPad applications from stores outside the official one. However, the first alternative that emerged, AltStore, offers very few apps at this time. And it has suffered some negative publicity after refusing to accept the latest version of its archenemy Spotify’s app, despite the fact that the audio platform had removed the link to its website for subscriptions. The DMA is a regulation that has the potential to break the dominant positions of Big Tech companies, but that outcome is not a given. Take the issue of surveillance: The commission has funds to pay the salaries of 80 employees, compared to the 120 requested by Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and the 220 requested by the European Parliament, as summarized by Bruegel in 2022. And on the website of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), Adam Kovacevich, founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress, a politically left-wing tech industry coalition (all of the digital giants, which also fund CEPA, are members), stated that the DMA, “instead of helping consumers, aims to help competitors. The DMA is making large tech firms’ services less useful, less secure, and less family-friendly. Europeans’ experience of large tech firms’ services is about to get worse compared to the experience of Americans and other non-Europeans.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Kovacevich represents an association financed by some of those same companies that the DMA is focused on, and there is a shared fear that the DMA will complicate the market and, in the end, benefit only a few companies—not necessarily those most at risk because of the dominance of Silicon Valley. It is not only lawsuits and fines, but also the perceptions of citizens and businesses that will help to determine whether EU regulations are successful. The results may come more slowly than desired by Brussels as new legislation is rarely positively received at first. Another regulatory act, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), has become the global industry standard, forcing online operators to change the way they handle our data. But if you ask the typical person on the street, they’ll likely tell you it’s just a simple cookie wall that you have to approve before continuing on to a webpage. Or it’s viewed as a law that has required the retention of dedicated external consultants on the part of companies. It is rarely described as the ultimate online privacy law, which is exactly what it is. That said, while the act has reshaped the privacy landscape, there have been challenges, as the digital rights association Noyb has explained. The privacy commissioners of Ireland and Luxembourg, where many web giants are based for tax purposes, have had bottlenecks in investigating violations. According to the latest figures from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), 19,581 complaints have been submitted in the past five years, but the body has made only 37 formal decisions and only eight of those began with complaints. Noyb recently conducted a survey of 1,000 data protection officers; 74 percent were convinced that if privacy officers investigated the typical European company, they would find at least one GDPR violation. The GDPR was also the impetus for another unsuccessful operation: separating the European cloud from the US cloud in order to shelter the data of EU citizens from Washington’s Cloud Act. In 2019, France and Germany announced with great fanfare a federation, Gaia-X, that would defend the continent and provide a response to the cloud market, which has been split between the United States and China. Five years later, the project has become bogged down in the process of establishing standards, after the entry of the giants it was supposed to counter, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Huawei, and Alibaba, as well as the controversial American company Palantir (which analyses data for defense purposes). This led some of the founders, such as the French cloud operator Scaleway, to flee, and that then turned the spotlight on the European Parliament, which led the commission to launch an alternative, the European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud, which counts among its 49 members 26 participants from Gaia-X (everyone except for the non-EU giants) and enjoys EU financial support. In the meantime, the Big Tech giants have found a solution that satisfies European wishes, investing en masse to establish data centers on EU soil. According to a study by consultancy firm Roland Berger, 34 data center transactions were finalized in 2023, growing at an average annual rate of 29.7 percent since 2019. According to Mordor Intelligence, another market analysis company, the sector in Europe will grow from €35.4 billion in 2024 to an estimated €57.7 billion in 2029. In recent weeks, Amazon web services announced €7.8 billion in investments in Germany. WIRED Italy has reported on Amazon’s interest in joining the list of accredited operators to host critical public administration data in Italy, which already includes Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. Notwithstanding its proclamations about sovereignty, Brussels has had to capitulate: The cloud is in the hands of the giants from the United States who have found themselves way ahead of their Chinese competitors after diplomatic relations between Beijing and Brussels cooled. The newest front in this digital battle is artificial intelligence. Here, too, the European Union has been the first to come up with some rules under its AI Act, the first legislation to address the different applications of this technology and establish permitted and prohibited uses based on risk assessments. The commission does not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. Mindful of the launch of the GDPR, which in 2018 caused companies to scramble to assure they were compliant, it wants to lead organizations through a period of voluntary adjustment. Already 400 companies have declared their interest in joining the effort, including IBM. In the meantime, Brussels must build a number of structures to make the AI Act work. First is the AI Council. It will have one representative from each country and will be divided into two subgroups, one dedicated to market development and the other to public sector uses of AI. In addition, it will be joined by a committee of technical advisers and an independent committee of scientists and experts, along the lines of the UN Climate Committee. Secondly, the AI Office, which sits within Directorate-General Connect (the department in charge of digital technology), will take care of administrative aspects of the AI Act. The office will assure that the act is applied uniformly, investigate alleged violations, establish codes of conduct, and classify artificial intelligence models that pose a systemic risk. Once the rules are established, research on new technologies can proceed. After it is fully operational, the office will employ 100 people, some of them redeployed from General Connect while others will be new hires. At the moment, the office is looking to hire six administrative staff and an unknown number of tech experts. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams On May 29, the first round of bids in support of the regulation expired. These included the AI Innovation Accelerator, a center that provides training, technical standards, and software and tools to promote research, support startups and small- and medium-sized enterprises, and assist public authorities that have to supervise AI. A total of €6 million is on the table. Another €2 million will finance management and €1.5 million will go to the EU’s AI testing facilities, which will, on behalf of countries’ antitrust authorities, analyze artificial intelligence models and products on the market to assure that they comply with EU rules. Finally, a total of €54 million is designated for a number of business initiatives. The EU knows it is lagging behind. According to an April report by the European Parliament’s research service, which provides data and intelligence to support legislative activities, the global AI market, which in 2023 was estimated at €130 billion, will reach close to €1.9 trillion in 2030. The lion’s share is in the United States, with €44 billion of private investment in 2022, followed by China with €12 billion. Overall, the European Union and the United Kingdom attracted €10.2 billion in the same year. According to Eurochamber researchers, between 2018 and the third quarter of 2023, US AI companies received €120 billion in investment, compared to €32.5 billion for European ones. Europe wants to counter the advance of the new AI giants with an open source model, and it has also made its network of supercomputers available to startups and universities to train algorithms. First, however, it had to adapt to the needs of the sector, investing almost €400 million in graphics cards, which, given the current boom in demand, will not arrive anytime soon. Among other projects to support the European AI market, the commission wants to use €24 million to launch a Language Technology Alliance that would bring together companies from different states to develop a generative AI to compete with ChatGPT and similar tools. It’s an initiative that closely resembles Gaia-X. Another €25 million is earmarked for the creation of a large open source language model, available to European companies to develop new services and research projects. The commission intends to fund several models and ultimately choose the one best suited to Europe’s needs. Overall, during the period from 2021 to 2027, the Digital Europe Program plans to spend €2.1 billion on AI. That figure may sound impressive, but it pales in comparison to the €10 billion that a single company, Microsoft, invested in OpenAI. The €25 million being spent on the European large language model effort, if distributed to many smaller projects, risks not even counterbalancing the €15 million that Microsoft has spent bringing France’s Mistral, Europe’s most talked-about AI startup, into its orbit. The big AI models will become presences in Brussels as soon as the AI Act, now finally approved, comes into full force. In short, the commission is making it clear in every way it can that a new sheriff is in town. But will the bureaucrats of Brussels be adequately armed to take on Big Tech? Only one thing is certain—it’s not going to be an easy task. This story was translated by John Newton."
65,Andrew Couts,Apple Is Coming for Your Password Manager,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-passwords-password-manager-wwdc-security-roundup/,"Plus: A media executive is charged in an alleged money-laundering scheme, a ransomware attack disrupts care at London hospitals, and Google’s former CEO has a secretive drone project up his sleeve.",2024-06-08T10:30:00Z,"Andrew Couts The largest data breach ever may be unfolding before our very eyes. What started as incidents impacting Ticketmaster and financial services firm Santander has snowballed into a multi-pronged attack potentially impacting hundreds of companies—and hundreds of millions of people. The source of the allegedly stolen data is Snowflake, a cloud storage firm, whose customers appear to have been targeted with infostealer malware that seemingly allowed hackers to access their Snowflake accounts. Microsoft has also (and once again) had a bad week. After the tech giant recently announced its new Recall tool—which takes screenshots of everything a person does on their PC every five seconds and makes it all searchable—security researchers set off the red alert that this, frankly, sounds like a terrible idea. Indeed, one researcher used a preview version of Recall to create a tool that extracts all the data stored by the feature in just seconds. Another found that the tool was vulnerable to “privilege escalation” attacks, making it possible for a hacker to access a Recall database even if they don’t have administrative powers. Microsoft apparently took the criticism to heart, however, and will now turn off Recall by default and add additional security measures. Embattled social media behemoth TikTok had a security scare this week after an attacker targeted high-profile TikTok users via direct messages in the app. TikTok says that only two accounts were successfully hijacked by the attack, while a third, belonging to celebrity Paris Hilton, was targeted but not taken over. Details about the incident remain sparse, but the company said Friday it has fixed the flaw that enabled the malware used to snatch accounts. The city of Chula Vista, California, has pioneered a new kind of policing: using drones to respond to 911 calls. The “drone as first responder” program is the first of its kind in the US and has launched more than 20,000 drone flights since it started in late 2018. A WIRED investigation, based on an analysis of more than 22 million flight coordinates, public records, and interviews with dozens of residents, revealed this week what it’s like to live in a future policed by machines. WIRED found this week that a US-based company enabled what the FBI believes are North Korean agents to carry out a scheme that funneled money to the country’s military. The scam involved setting up shell companies, through which North Koreans would get freelance IT jobs with US firms, and have the money they earned given to Kim Jong Un’s regime. The company that registered those shell companies is based in Wyoming, and it says it has since stopped working with the implicated shell companies. We also laid out the privacy and security risks of using AI in the workplace, explored the ways a potential second Trump administration could weaponize surveillance against US residents, detailed how YouTube has become a giant crack in Russia’s propaganda firewall, and highlighted a Silicon Valley–funded startup that says it’s building a “handheld iron dome” for shooting drones out of the sky using standard firearms. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams That’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. At Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference next week, the company will reportedly announce its own stand-alone password manager that will compete with apps like 1Password and LastPass. Dubbed simply Passwords, according to Bloomberg News, the app will reportedly have features that go well beyond the iCloud or Mac Keychain tools Apple already offers, allowing users to save passwords for Wi-Fi networks, store passkeys, and organize login credentials into categories. Passwords will also reportedly work on Windows machines, but it’s unclear whether people who use Android devices can get in on the security tool. US prosecutors on Monday charged an executive at The Epoch Times newspaper with carrying out a massive money-laundering scheme. According to the US Department of Justice, Epoch Times chief financial officer Weidong “Bill” Guan engaged in “a transnational scheme to launder at least approximately $67 million of illegally obtained funds to benefit himself and the media company.” The scheme, according to the indictment against Guan, largely involved using cryptocurrency to purchase prepaid debit cards “loaded with US dollars that had been obtained through various frauds”—including funds obtained through unemployment benefits fraud—for less than the funds on the prepaid debit cards. The purchase of the cards was carried out by members of The Epoch Times’ “Make Money Online” team, which Guan managed, according to the DOJ. The so-called MMO team would allegedly then use “stolen personal identification information” to open various accounts, which were used to transfer money from the prepaid debit cards to bank accounts associated with The Epoch Times and its employees. Guan faces one count of conspiring to commit money laundering, two counts of bank fraud, and could face decades in prison if convicted. Google’s former CEO, billionaire Eric Schmidt, is quietly building a military drone company, reports Forbes. The company, called White Stork, has been testing devices at both its Hillspire office complex in Menlo Park, California, and in Ukraine. Relatively little has been publicly revealed about the company or the specifics of its technology. According to Forbes, however, “individuals flying small drones” have been spotted near the Hillspire property, and Schmidt has reportedly hired alumni from Google, SpaceX, and Apple to carry out his secretive project, providing some clues about its ambitions. A cyberattack against an organization that facilitates blood transfusions and other sensitive medical care disrupted hospitals and other health care entities across London this week. The attack targeted Synnovis, which manages a partnership between King’s College Hospitals trust and Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital trust, and Synlab, a European medical testing firm. In a statement published on Tuesday, Synnovis said the attack “has affected all Synnovis IT systems, resulting in interruptions to many of our pathology services.” This forced hospitals to cancel surgeries involving blood transfusions and other procedures. Ciaran Martin, a former top UK cybersecurity official, blamed the attack on Qilin, a cybercriminal gang believed to have ties to Russia."
66,Andy Greenberg,Microsoft's Recall Feature Is Even More Hackable Than You Thought,https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-windows-recall-privilege-escalation/,A new discovery that the AI-enabled feature's historical data can be accessed even by hackers without administrator privileges only contributes to the growing sense that the feature is a “dumpster fire.”,2024-06-07T00:42:44Z,"Andy Greenberg Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella has hailed the company's new Recall feature, which stores a history of your computer desktop and makes it available to AI for analysis, as “photographic memory” for your PC. Within the cybersecurity community, meanwhile, the notion of a tool that silently takes a screenshot of your desktop every five seconds has been hailed as a hacker's dream come true and the worst product idea in recent memory. Now, security researchers have pointed out that even the one remaining security safeguard meant to protect that feature from exploitation can be trivially defeated. Since Recall was first announced last month, the cybersecurity world has pointed out that if a hacker can install malicious software to gain a foothold on a target machine with the feature enabled, they can quickly gain access to the user's entire history stored by the function. The only barrier, it seemed, to that high-resolution view of a victim's entire life at the keyboard was that accessing Recall's data required administrator privileges on a user's machine. That meant malware without that higher-level privilege would trigger a permission pop-up, allowing users to prevent access, and that malware would also likely be blocked by default from accessing the data on most corporate machines. Then on Wednesday, James Forshaw, a researcher with Google's Project Zero vulnerability research team, published an update to a blog post pointing out that he had found methods for accessing Recall data without administrator privileges—essentially stripping away even that last fig leaf of protection. “No admin required ;-)” the post concluded. “Damn,” Forshaw added on Mastodon. “I really thought the Recall database security would at least be, you know, secure.” Forshaw's blog post described two different techniques to bypass the administrator privilege requirement, both of which exploit ways of defeating a basic security function in Windows known as access control lists that determine which elements on a computer require which privileges to read and alter. One of Forshaw's methods exploits an exception to those control lists, temporarily impersonating a program on Windows machines called AIXHost.exe that can access even restricted databases. Another is even simpler: Forshaw points out that because the Recall data stored on a machine is considered to belong to the user, a hacker with the same privileges as the user could simply rewrite the access control lists on a target machine to grant themselves access to the full database. That second, simpler bypass technique “is just mindblowing, to be honest,” says Alex Hagenah, a cybersecurity strategist and ethical hacker. Hagenah recently built a proof-of-concept hacker tool called TotalRecall designed to show that someone who gained access to a victim's machine with Recall could immediately siphon out all the user's history recorded by the feature. Hagenah's tool, however, still required that hackers find another way to gain administrator privileges through a so-called “privilege escalation” technique before his tool would work. With Forshaw's technique, “you don’t need any privilege escalation, no pop-up, nothing,” says Hagenah. “This would make sense to implement in the tool for a bad guy.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams In fact, just an hour after speaking to WIRED about Forshaw's finding, Hagenah added the simpler of Forshaw's two techniques to his TotalRecall tool, then confirmed that the trick worked by accessing all the Recall history data stored on another user's machine for which he didn't have administrator access. “So simple and genius,” he wrote in a text to WIRED after testing the technique. That confirmation removes one of the last arguments Recall's defenders have had against criticisms that the feature acts as, essentially, a piece of pre-installed spyware on a user's machine, ready to be exploited by any hacker who can gain a foothold on the device. “It makes your security very fragile, in the sense that anyone who penetrates your computer for even a second can get your whole history,” says Dave Aitel, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Immunity and a former NSA hacker. “Which is not something people want.” For now, security researchers have been testing Recall in preview versions of the tool ahead of its expected launch later this month. Microsoft said it plans to integrate Recall on compatible Copilot+ PCs with the feature turned on by default. WIRED reached out to the company for comment on Forshaw's findings about Recall's security issues, but the company has yet to respond. The revelation that hackers can exploit Recall without even using a separate privilege escalation technique only contributes further to the sense that the feature was rushed to market without a proper review from the company's cybersecurity team—despite the company's CEO Nadella proclaiming just last month that Microsoft would make security its first priority in every decision going forward. “You cannot convince me that Microsoft's security teams looked at this and said ‘that looks secure,’” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and now the VP of R&D at the cybersecurity consultancy Hunter Strategy, where he says he's been asked by some of the firm's clients to test Recall's security before they add Microsoft devices that use it to their networks. “As it stands now, it’s a security dumpster fire,” Williams says. “This is one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen from an enterprise security standpoint.” Updated 12:15 pm ET, June 7, 2024: Following criticism from the security and privacy community, Microsoft announced on Friday that it would turn off Recall by default and institute additional security measures."
67,Boone Ashworth,Some Cheap Wired Headphones Are Actually Using Bluetooth,https://www.wired.com/story/some-cheap-wired-headphones-are-actually-using-bluetooth/,"Even though your budget buds are connected to wires, they might still require wireless connectivity. Is this a scam, or a clever way around Apple’s licensing restrictions?",2024-06-07T12:00:00Z,"Boone Ashworth Buy a pair of wired headphones, and you’d be forgiven for thinking they’re just plug and play. Stick them into your phone, and out goes the audio up copper cables into your earholes. Simple as that. Trouble is, that straightforward mechanism has gotten more complicated, and in recent years there has been an influx of budget wired earbuds that, counterintuitively, depend on Bluetooth to function, despite having those copper cables. The problem is largely present in earbuds designed for iPhones. In 2016, Apple removed universal 3.5-mm headphone jacks in its iPhones, which means there are nearly eight years worth of iPhones out in the world—from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone 14—that can connect to headphones only via Bluetooth or Apple’s proprietary Lightning ports. (Apple switched to USB-C ports in its iPhones last year after legislation from the European Union put pressure on device companies to standardize connection ports.) Apple used this move to push its wireless AirPods, and it also sells its own wired headphones that connect to its Lightning ports for $19. You can also get an official $9 dongle that adapts the Lightning port to a 3.5-mm output. These work as intended, connecting with the Lightning port to playback audio. But Apple also has strict certification processes called MFi that require any accessories for Apple products to meet certain requirements in order to work with the Lightning port as intended. That means companies have to pay for the privilege of being a genuine Apple accessory. (If you have an unlicensed accessory, you’ll probably see an alert pop up every time you plug it in saying, “Accessory may not be supported.”) This has led to a steady trickle of knockoff earbuds that have chosen to use roundabout ways of connecting to Apple’s proprietary port. Namely, by requiring a Bluetooth connection—even for wired buds. What’s going on is this: The plug on the buds using this workaround goes into the Lightning slot, which then doubles as a Bluetooth receiver that receives power from the port but routes its signal through the phone’s Bluetooth. That means your wired connection is actually wireless. Yes, the audio is moving from the headphone jack to the earbuds in a traditional wired manner, but the signal gets to the jack through no physical data transfer at all. So, bizarrely, even though the buds are plugged into your phone, all they’re doing with this physical connection is drawing power for their onboard Bluetooth chip. (And potentially eating up more of your battery life.) OK, this all likely seems very complicated and roundabout, so you might well ask: “Why bother? Why not just make them Bluetooth earbuds to begin with?” Well, aside from keeping that annoying unsupported accessory message from popping up constantly, it’s cheaper to make wired earbuds than to fit a tiny battery into each wireless bud. Bluetooth is an open standard, meaning just about anybody can develop with it, while accessing Apple’s Lightning ports requires a presumably pricey certification process that would get passed down to the customer. And boy, people sure love cheap earbuds. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Is it a scam? Technically no—but depending on your point of view, there's either deception going on here or some kind of ingenious hack. Still, for better or worse, it is a way for companies to get around one of the many restrictions Apple puts on doing business with the company. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) “I’m on the side that sees this as an ingenious solution to the problem,” says Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at the tech analyst firm IDC. Compared to other types of knockoff products, like phony SSD hard drives or off-market chargers that can overheat your phone so much it catches on fire, these roundabout headphones certainly aren’t the worst offender. “The Bluetooth Lightning headphones at least perform their advertised function without any detriment to the end user,” says Ubrani. Still, that doesn’t mean the devices are good. These knockoff buds have been out in the world for years, and have been complained about on viral X threads and places like Reddit and YouTube, yet they persist. There’s a slew of them available on sites like Amazon, often listed as sponsored links that appear at the top of search results. As you might expect from such products, they are typically inexpensive and get poor reviews from customers about sound and build quality. Also, again, they require Bluetooth to be on at all times in order to work. You get what you pay for, sure, but most importantly, many of these workaround earbuds also don’t disclose that they require Bluetooth to be on at all times. So while it may be a clever trick, it’s also a dubious practice if a company doesn’t properly inform the consumer of what they’re getting.

68,Morgan Meaker,Danish Media Threatens to Sue OpenAI,https://www.wired.com/story/danish-media-demands-a-deal-with-openai-or-else/,"Danish media outlets want a group deal with OpenAI amid fears that smaller countries will become marginalized as chatbots become prolific. If they don’t get one, they are threatening to sue.",2024-06-11T06:00:00Z,"Morgan Meaker In the latest battle between AI and the media, major Danish newspapers and TV stations are threatening to sue OpenAI unless the company compensates the country’s press for allegedly using their content to train its models. “We want remuneration for our work [which] they have used to train their model,” says Karen Rønde, CEO of the Danish Press Publications’ Collective Management Organization (DPCMO), which represents 99 percent of Danish media outlets, including state broadcaster DR and TV 2. Rønde says the DPCMO plans to sue if a deal is not reached in the next year. AI has created a new front in copyright law after a series of lawsuits claimed that OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, scraped news companies’ websites without permission in order to train its AI models. Soon after those lawsuits, OpenAI struck a series of licensing deals with major publishers, enabling the company to train its future iterations of ChatGPT on their content. Financial terms for the deals have not been disclosed. Now, Danish media is attempting to force OpenAI to negotiate with them as a collective, an unusual tactic that could provide a model for other small countries if successful. So far, OpenAI has been striking deals with publishers individually and has announced content partnerships with the Financial Times and the Atlantic, as well as German media conglomerate Axel Springer, French newspaper Le Monde, and Spanish group Prisa. After meeting with OpenAI online and in-person earlier this year, Rønde says she was left with the impression that Denmark was not a top priority. “It was made clear that the focus was the deal in Germany and the deal in France and the deal in Spain and of course, the American ones,” she says. “There are so many content creators in all the other territories and they are now left with nothing.” Rønde has sent a letter to OpenAI’s lawyer at Dutch firm Brinkhof informing them of Danish copyright law, and says she is waiting for a response. She presumes OpenAI has already used content from Danish press websites because the company has not told her otherwise, she says. Neither OpenAI nor Brinkhof replied to WIRED’s request for comment. For Rønde, time is of the essence. She wants to strike a deal with OpenAI and also Google’s Gemini in the next year, before the use of AI chatbots and search engine overviews further marginalizes publishers’ websites. “Maybe then it [will be] too late, and the value of the press publishers’ content will be—in one or two or three years—too low,” she says. “If we cannot enter into a partnership agreement within a reasonably short time frame, then we need to enforce our rights.” DPCMO was set up in 2021 to help Danish media negotiate with Big Tech. “We needed to stand united, otherwise we feared that Denmark would be too small a country to be prioritized in the discussion with Big Tech,” says Rønde. Last year, the group secured preliminary license agreements with Microsoft’s Bing and Google to feature Danish publishers’ content in the company’s search engines. Although the agreements outlined that publishers should be compensated by the two companies, the deals did not agree on how much.

69,Adam Bumas,Who’s Afraid of 'Skibidi Toilet'?,https://www.wired.com/story/whos-afraid-of-skibidi-toilet/,The bizarre animated YouTube series is so huge that it’s caught the attention of concerned parents and the Russian government. But it’s still a mystery to almost anyone over 30—except Stephen Colbert.,2024-06-10T11:00:00Z,"Adam Bumas If you’re baffled by Skibidi Toilet, you’re not alone. The bizarre animated YouTube series centers on an alien invasion: a swarm of singing heads, all popping out of toilets, has descended on a Los Angeles–like metropolis and triggered a surreal, cartoonish, apocalyptic war. That’s a more direct and clear explanation than you’ll find in the actual videos, since they’re all almost completely wordless. There’s no language barrier, which is a major reason why the videos have been viewed hundreds of millions of times, becoming a global cultural phenomenon among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Surprisingly for something so popular, Skibidi Toilet has garnered a reputation for being incomprehensible to anyone who isn’t a fan. Its impenetrable nature has raised serious concerns around the world. Some call it a moral outrage, foreign propaganda meant to prey on vulnerable young minds, or even a disease. In a cultural climate where it’s harder and harder to understand trends and popularity, people are searching for an explanation for how singing toilets conquered the world. On the May 22 episode of The Late Show, Stephen Colbert punched up a joke about the Biden campaign using Skibidi Toilet to attract the youth vote, saying that if anyone didn’t get the gag, their grandchildren could explain it “and you still won’t understand.” As random as the videos can seem, their success isn’t. Skibidi Toilet deftly combines modern storytelling trends with nostalgic internet humor in a way that magnifies the outwardly confusing qualities of both. “It was initially appealing to young people for its utter weirdness,” says danah boyd, a partner researcher at Microsoft Research. “Parents (and many other adults) probably reacted with revulsion, as they’ve done many other times. That revulsion from adults makes it even more appealing to young people.” That’s why the word “skibidi” has become a more general shibboleth for Gen Z and younger, in the same class as “rizz”, “gyat,” and “sigma.” Adults being shocked and confounded at kids having fun creates a feedback loop where kids want to make it even more distressing. The videos certainly have a lot of shock value, featuring surreal, disturbing, and violent imagery. In an interview with Forbes in February, Alexey Gerasimov, who creates the videos and uploads them under the name “DaFuq!?Boom!,” described the videos as being inspired by his own recurring nightmares. In that light, it can be easy to see why the global success has been met with an equally global panic. Last August, several writers and journalists in Malaysia and Indonesia warned parents about the dangers of a “Skibidi toilet syndrome” that would cause children to refuse to stop imitating the toilet’s songs and dances. Earlier this year, Robbie Collin wrote in the Telegraph that the videos were a sign YouTube needed more strictly enforced age limits. Other sources are going even farther, calling the surreal meme videos a threat to national security. In February, reporter Olga Sosnina claimed in a Swedish news outlet that Skibidi Toilet was Russian propaganda aimed at indoctrinating children. Russia was just as worried: In January, Moscow officials were called to investigate the videos. In April, Anna Mityanina, St. Petersburg’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights, played the videos to the city’s legislative assembly as part of an annual report on risks to children. “There is no need to pretend that there are no standards of decency,” Mityanina said. “A character in the form of a toilet, to put it mildly, is not cultured enough.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams For all of the worry, there isn’t much to be concerned about within the Skibidi Toilet videos themselves. “I see these media as reflective of our societal obsessions,” says boyd. “As always, young people twist it slightly in a way that makes adults uncomfortable because they don’t want to reckon with their own passions.” The videos, as uncanny as they can get, don’t contain anything particularly unsuitable for children. The violence is unrelenting and large in scope, but never goes beyond cartoonish explosions and punches. Characters who appear to be killed or turned to the villain’s side regularly return to fight alongside the heroes. The largely wordless storytelling, of course, puts a limit on mature themes. Ultimately, the most “indecent” element of the videos is the toilets themselves, which will always be a hit with the younger generation. That’s not the only area where Skibidi Toilet follows a long tradition. Gerasimov (who didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment) animates the videos using the Source Filmmaker program, but he’s modified the animation interface to emulate the 2006 game Garry’s Mod. Garry’s Mod, true to its name, was initially a fanmade modification of the game Half-Life 2 that removed any structure or objective, leading to a purely creative sandbox years before Minecraft’s Creative Mode. The game was used to create thousands of machinima videos throughout the late 2000s, and Gerasimov calls these videos a primary inspiration for Skibidi Toilet. Maddy Buxton, the head of YouTube’s culture and trends team, says this is a major factor in the videos’ success. “One thing we know about Gen Z viewers and creators is they’re interested in nostalgia. It’s hearkening back to this earlier time, even if they didn’t grow up in it themselves,” Buxton says. Skibidi Toilet was one of the top trending topics last year on YouTube, where at one point it garnered 2.8 billion views in 28 days. Nostalgia and scatological humor can be eye-catching, but to build up the kind of sustained interest and devotion Gerasimov has, there needs to be a story in its own right. The narrative of Skibidi Toilet isn’t communicated directly, but that only adds to its intrigue for many viewers, especially younger ones who are used to having to put in extra work to get the full picture. “We’ve been looking into the role of lore in building these big fan communities,” says Buxton. “The ones that aren’t just passively watching, but digging into the backstory.” “We’ve been looking into the role of lore in building these big fan communities. The ones that aren’t just passively watching, but digging into the backstory.” That digging is so popular that it’s transcending traditional structures of fandom. There’s no shortage of ways to be a fan of something online, but Skibidi Toilet’s audience has spent most, if not all, of their lives on the internet, and their work comes out in extremely online forms. Acolytes flood YouTube with breakdown videos and expand on the worldbuilding with Roblox games. Then there’s the comment-section fiction: Wherever the videos are posted, the comments are filled with dozens or hundreds of people providing their own written narratives retelling the events of the video, filling the gap left by the storytelling with their own words. It’s a cross between a liveblogged reaction and fan fiction, creating lore where none existed. The idea of lore is now fundamental to the way many people consume any fiction, but it started in the world of video games, especially games like Dark Souls that have virtually no direct storytelling. There are hundreds of unofficial Skibidi Toilet games that let players take part in the battles, but the videos themselves invite a similar degree of participation. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “People are coming at it from different entry points,” says Buxton. “Some people are coming in from the gaming world, some are coming just for the action storytelling, some like to unpack lore.” She describes these unusual fan works as “casual creation,” saying that “this idea of being a daily creator makes it much easier to be an active fan than it was five, 10, 15 years ago. Now you can engage in the subject of your fandom by creating it online.” Of course, Skibidi Toilet itself could be categorized as a fan creation, containing numerous echoes of Garry’s Mod and the Half-Life games. Like many recent works that emerge online, from streetwear trends to unauthorized TikTok musicals, Skibidi Toilet blurs the line between fan work and original work. “Lots of the kids who got into Skibidi Toilet don’t know anything about where these characters and assets are sourced from,” says Phillip Hamilton, an associate editor at Know Your Meme. Beyond the actual content of the videos, their release schedule is also a factor. “Skibidi Toilet is huge with people (namely kids) who always want more,” says Hamilton. “Each episode is about a minute long and they blast by so fast, with episodes coming out super frequently.” During the first wave of the videos’ popularity in mid-2023, Gerasimov was uploading at least two videos each week for months, sometimes uploading a video every single day. Social media algorithms have prioritized more frequent uploaders for years, and Gerasimov had been animating in Source Filmmaker for more than a decade, giving him enough experience to crank out the videos fast enough to satisfy YouTube’s algorithm. “I think Skibidi Toilet’s ‘negative effects’ on kids are mostly just the obsessive, seemingly addictive aspect. It’s the same reason parents worry about short-form video platforms like TikTok.” This isn’t the first time the algorithm has popularized content that adults find inappropriate for children. In 2017, YouTube faced a public outcry when it was found that the platform was promoting hundreds of disturbing videos, and allowing them to be viewed on its family-friendly YouTube Kids app. The controversy would be known as “Elsagate,” since the offending videos featured popular children’s characters like Elsa, Spider-Man, and Peppa Pig undergoing gory medical procedures, getting kidnapped, and more. These videos were transparent attempts to game YouTube’s recommendation system for ad revenue. Many of them had hundreds of seemingly inauthentic comments to boost engagement metrics, and a report by the New York Times found one prominent channel was creating videos with a team of roughly 100 people. YouTube made changes to its algorithm to disincentivize scammers from making these videos. They can’t do the same to flush away Skibidi Toilet, because it wasn’t made to satisfy the algorithm in the same way. It’s a much smaller operation, made with genuine craft and artistic intention. Gerasimov made the videos longer and more ambitious as the series grew in popularity, but that growth happened thanks to people actually enjoying the series, not for associations with popular characters. Nonetheless, they’ve become even more of a hit among the younger generation, and for parents, this seems to be the real underlying fear. “I think Skibidi Toilet’s ‘negative effects’ on kids are mostly just the obsessive, seemingly addictive aspect,” says Hamilton. “It’s the same reason parents worry about short-form video platforms like TikTok.” The videos took off at the perfect time—after the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated a general shift away from in-person social interaction—for their weirdness to feed into paranoia about what a screen-mediated life might be doing to impressionable young minds. When it comes to children’s browsing habits, there are many scarier things they might find online than Skibidi Toilet. As strange as the videos are, they wouldn’t do very well as propaganda or even advertising. There’s no agenda, for good or ill, besides the entertainment value. In the Washington Post, Taylor Lorenz compared Skibidi Toilet to “harmless entertainment” like Cocomelon and other children’s videos. Not everyone is happy about the popularity of Cocomelon, but that popularity hasn’t caused the same kind of panic."
70,Kate Knibbs,Worried About AI Killing Art? This App Offers a Refuge—If Its Founder Can Keep the Lights On,https://www.wired.com/story/cara-portfolio-app-artificial-intelligence-jingna-zhang/,"Artists are fleeing Meta’s platforms over fears their work will be used to train AI. Photographer Jingna Zhang’s Cara promises protection, but the influx of new users is taxing her niche portfolio app.",2024-06-12T11:00:00Z,"By Kate Knibbs “I was about to go to bed and then realized we had this interview,” Jingna Zhang tells me. It’s 9 am in Seattle, where she’s currently living. The photographer and art director has been pulling all-nighters trying to keep up with demand for her social platform for artists, Cara, which recently exploded in popularity in response to widespread opposition to Meta’s policies around art and artificial intelligence. (Meta includes art from users in its training data.) More users has led to an onslaught of complications, including a hefty $96,000 bill from the social network’s cloud storage provider, as well as service outages. Cara began as a side project, but its newfound prominence means that Zhang is now an accidental startup founder, keeping the hours to match. Zhang started Cara to give artists who oppose unethical use of AI a place to share images and network with like-minded peers. The platform takes an explicit stance against generative AI tools developed with training data acquired without permission from artists, and it currently filters out all AI images. It also offers beta integration with Glaze, a tool developed by University of Chicago researchers to give artists a way to stop generative AI companies from training on their work without consent. Launched in early 2023, Cara had just a few thousand users for the first year of its life; last week, it jumped from having around 40,000 accounts to 650,000, and is now closing in on a million users. Although she’s never navigated a moment quite like this before, Zhang is a seasoned advocate for artist’s rights. In 2022, she filed a lawsuit against a painter who had won prize money submitting work that looked shockingly similar to a photograph she took in 2017 for Harper’s Bazaar. Although the suit was initially dismissed, Zhang won on appeal in March 2024. In December 2023, she joined an ongoing class action lawsuit against Stable Diffusion and other companies offering AI image generation tools, and in April 2024, she joined a similar lawsuit against Google as a lead plaintiff. WIRED recently called Zhang to check in on how she’s handling the chaos of viral popularity, and how she thinks about the future of art in the age of AI. Kate Knibbs: Walk me through the past few weeks of your life. What was it like when Cara started seeing this surge in users? Jingna Zhang: For quite a while, I decided not to promote Cara too much, besides our launch announcement in January 2023, and then when we partnered with Glaze. We were still building out features. We were volunteers, doing it in our own time, not a startup trying to do hyper-growth. We had dealt with some security attacks when we partnered with Glaze, so we were like, is this an attack? Was it? It was genuine traffic. People were posting—regular people, artists, not spam. At first we thought it was a random spike, and then we realized it was because of the AI policy from Meta. At one point I woke up and we’d gained 20,000 more users in a day. Then the next day it was probably 50,000 more. Two days is usually how long the internet hype cycle lasts, and then people move on. But more people kept joining. Things started crashing, we were trying to fix them. We scaled up our database seven times. We’ve fixed our server issues. It’s stable, it’s online. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams At the moment we’re having this conversation, how many people have Cara accounts? Now we’re at nearly 900,000 users. But it’s been stressful. Yesterday or the day before—I’m losing track of time now—I saw a bill from a service provider and it was almost $100,000 for six days. So we’re trying to figure out our financial situation. It’s an ongoing process. Now we’re at nearly 900,000 users. But it’s been stressful. Yesterday or the day before—I’m losing track of time now—I saw a bill from a service provider and it was almost $100,000 for six days. Are they working with you to reduce the bill? I certainly hope so. We've had multiple calls and are working through things. There have been other service providers talking to us too, so we have options, but I'm hopeful that we can work it out with these guys and keep a longterm relationship. This wasn’t meant to be your full-time gig. Is there a point where this gets too big and you have to look for partners? And are you considering a subscription model or outside investors? Before this all happened, the next thing on our to-do list was to start a subscription service for our users, to see what the response would be and whether it would be self-sustaining. Now we don’t have time—we have to pay the bills now. So I’m looking at all options. Do you worry about people from outside your circle getting involved and having a say? The important thing is that I maintain control of how I’m building Cara. I love to be independent and want to do it on my own as long as possible, but in the worst-case scenario, we raise money. I did consider a friends and family [funding] round for later this year, with people I can absolutely trust. Where would you like to see Cara in five years? I want to see what the community needs and build according to that. I have some idea of how generative AI will impact jobs, and how it might reduce pay even for people who still have jobs, but who is to say what will be the most helpful in five years? I’m sorry if that sounds like a non-answer, but I just think you have to adapt as best you can and build what makes the most sense in the moment. How many people are working on Cara right now? Four or five of us for the last year or so. We temporarily have a bunch of help. I don’t know if they’ll stick around, but right now we have closer to 10 on the engineering team working with us through this crisis. Originally we had three staff helping me day-to-day, and right now we have 10 to 20 people trying to do things like manage our Discord, which last time I checked had between 8,000 and 10,000 people. They’re trying to manage content moderation. On Instagram we have tens of thousands of messages. Everyone just wants to help, and people are being really kind. Backing up a bit, could you walk me through joining the class action lawsuits against generative AI companies? I don’t really like to be involved in things, but if nobody has addressed something that I’d like to see, I’ll do it. It doesn’t matter if it makes me unpopular. It was a little difficult for me to watch when people were still in the denial stage about generative AI being usable for work. This will never replace artists, look how bad the hands are. I will say that the hands are, indeed, bad. My exposure to tech and art production is different since I work as a photographer and I’m in the pipeline of production. I’d have companies sending me demos talking about natural language processing being used to generate stuff five, six years ago. I stayed out of the AI discourse for a while because I was underway with my own copyright lawsuit at the time, and there was a lot of harassment. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams What made you get involved? Karla Ortiz, one of the lead plaintiffs of the lawsuit I joined—we’ve known each other online for a long time—we talked about all this copyright and AI stuff. I knew they wanted to have more lead plaintiffs to offer a broader representation. I thought that photographers’ voices were important to include too, so I became the only photographer on the lawsuit. Licensing is a huge part of our business. You are supposed to have licensed our work from us, to build a dataset, to use it for anything. So Karla and I got talking and eventually I felt that it was the right time to join. What made it the right time? The biggest reason I thought I’d be a good addition was because people keep saying that artists only care about copyright now because they see that image generators have taken their work. I wanted to show that it’s wrong—that we cared about this before generative AI. Is there anything about generative AI art tools that you see as a positive? If they were made with clean data, I might be able to think of ways to use tools to automate some of my own processes. But the problem is, I don’t think a little bit of convenience for me is worth the price of many people losing their jobs. Creative work—why is this the thing we have to focus on automating away? How about all the chores in daily life that are a pain? What can regular people who want to support regular artists do at this moment? Participate in the conversation, educate friends and family and even people online who may not understand copyright law or what people are fighting for. There have been some callous comments about how artists are just salty or bad at adapting—no, this is about copyright law. Participate in some kind of lobbying, some activism. Automation, generative AI in the workplace, it’s coming for more than just designers and artists. It’s already being used in sales negotiations. If you look at the cycle of venture funding in the last couple years, a lot of startups focus on automating away receptionists, admins, salespeople. Lots of white-collar jobs will be automated away. This is not just about one group of people. It’s going to touch people all across our society."
71,Will Knight,Apple's Biggest AI Challenge? Making It Behave,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-ios-macos-ai-openai/,"Apple Intelligence will make apps and services smarter. But Apple’s most notable innovations focus on ensuring the technology doesn't disappoint, annoy, or offend.",2024-06-10T23:39:55Z,"Will Knight Apple has a history of succeeding despite being late to market so many times before: the iPhone, the Apple Watch, AirPods, to name a few cases. Now the company hopes to show that the same approach will work with generative artificial intelligence, announcing today an Apple Intelligence initiative that bakes the technology into just about every device and application Apple offers. Apple unveiled its long-awaited AI strategy at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) today. “This is a moment we've been working towards for a long time,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook at the event. “We're tremendously excited about the power of generating models.” That may be so, but Apple also seems to understand that generative AI must be handled with care since the technology is notoriously data hungry and error prone. The company showed Apple Intelligence infusing its apps with new capabilities, including a more capable Siri voice assistant, a version of Mail that generates complex email responses, and Safari summarizing web information. The trick will be doing those things while minimizing hallucinations, potentially offensive content, and other classic pitfalls of generative AI—while also protecting user privacy. Apple Intelligence will still tap into private user information to make its models more useful by better understanding a person’s interests, habits, and schedule, for instance. But those insights typically require privacy trade-offs that Apple is trying to avoid. “We think about what it means for intelligence to be really useful, it has to be centered on you,” Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said at a briefing after the WWDC keynote presentation. “That requires some really deep thoughts about privacy.” While many generative AI programs, including ChatGPT, run in the cloud, Apple says Apple Intelligence would primarily use AI models running locally on its devices. It has also developed a way to determine whether a query needs to be handed off to a more powerful AI model in the cloud, and a technology called Private Cloud Compute that it says will keep personal data secure should it be sent off-device. In a blog post outlining the technology, Apple said Private Cloud Compute would be designed to prevent the information used in a query from being retained by a model or anywhere else on the device, and would not allow developers or Apple to access sensitive information. It said the system would use a new server hardware that uses Apple silicon to keep data in secure storage areas, and will employ end-to-end encryption to ensure data cannot be spied on. “I think it solves a necessary, profound challenge,” Federighi said. “Cloud computing typically comes with some real compromises when it comes to privacy assurances. Even if a company makes some promise, ‘We’re not going to do anything with your data,’ you have no way to verify that.” Keeping that data private shouldn’t compromise Apple Intelligence’s capabilities, said John Giannandrea, senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy, at the same briefing. In another blog post, Apple revealed that it has developed its own AI models using a framework called AXLearn, which it made open source in 2023. It said that it has employed several techniques to reduce the latency and boost the efficiency of its models. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Giannandrea said that Apple had focused on reducing hallucinations in its models partly by using curated data. “We have put considerable energy into training these models very carefully,” he said. “So we're pretty confident that we're applying this technology responsibly.” That training wheels approach to AI applies across Apple’s offering. If it works as promised, it should mean that Apple Intelligence is less prone to fabricate or suggest something inappropriate. In its blog post, Apple claimed that testers found its models more useful and less harmful more often than competing on-device models from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. ""We're not taking this teenager and sort of telling him to go fly an airplane,"" Federighi said. Apple’s hotly anticipated tie-in with OpenAI will also keep ChatGPT at arms length, with Siri and a new writing assistant called Writing Tools only tapping it for certain tricky queries, and with a user’s permission. “We'll ask you before you go to ChatGPT,” Federighi said. “From a privacy point of view, you're always in control and have total transparency with that experience that you leave Apple's privacy realm and go out and use that other model.” Apple’s deal with OpenAI would have once seemed highly unlikely. The startup has experienced a meteoric rise, thanks to the brilliance of its chatbot, but it has also repeatedly courted controversy with legal battles, boardroom drama, and its relentless promotion of a powerful but unreliable technology. Federighi said that Apple may incorporate Google’s flagship Gemini model at a future date, without offering further information. Apple has been derided for moving slower than its competitors in building generative AI, and it has not yet revealed anything as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, but the company has published some notable AI research, including details of company multimodal models that run on devices. Apple once seemed to have a lead in leveraging AI for personal computing, after launching Siri in 2011. The assistant made use of recent AI breakthroughs at the time to recognize speech more reliably, and sought to turn a limited range of voice commands into useful actions on the iPhone. Competitors like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, soon followed suit with voice assistants of their own, but their utility was fundamentally limited by the challenge of parsing meaning from complex and ambiguous language. The large language models that power programs like ChatGPT represent a significant advance in machines’ ability to handle language, and Apple and others hope to use AI to upgrade their personal assistants in a number of ways. LLMs could make helpers like Siri better able to understand complex commands and hold relatively sophisticated conversations. They could also provide a way for assistants to use software by writing code on-the-fly. “They came through with a commitment to personal, private, and context-aware AI,” says Tom Gruber, an AI entrepreneur who cofounded the company that developed Siri, which was acquired by Apple in 2010. Gruber says he was happy to see the company demo use cases that emphasized those features. Other observers say that Apple’s announcements amount to an effort to match the competition without risking too many gaffes. “What Apple is great at is offering great new capabilities and showing us new ways to do things,” says David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. “None of the things announced seem like that, which isn’t surprising because they’re playing catch-up.” Yoffie says Apple’s focus on data privacy and security was unsurprising given the worries people have about sharing data with programs like ChatGPT. “Generative AI is a complement for the iPhone,” he says. “I think it’s important that they show they aren’t behind the Android world, which I think they did today.” Still, generative AI is definitionally unpredictable. Apple Intelligence may have behaved in testing, but there’s no way to account for every output once it’s unleashed on millions of iOS and macOS users. To live up to its WWDC promises, Apple will need to imbue AI with a feature no one else has yet managed. It needs to make it behave."

By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: Do you generally subscribe to the idea that Apple doesn't do things first, but then often does it better? Michael Calore: Yeah, I mean, it worked with the iPod. It worked with the iPad very well. It has maybe not worked with Vision Pro. They came out with the iPhone first, but I'm not entirely sold on iPhones. I mean, I use a Pixel. Lauren Goode: It seems like they did something right with the iPhone, but you are not sold. Michael Calore: Yeah. I mean, by and large, though, yes, Apple has done very well with its wait-and-see and then do it better than everybody else approach. Lauren Goode: What about AI? Michael Calore: What about it? Lauren Goode: Do you think that Apple's artificial intelligence is going to be better than the other tech companies? Michael Calore: I mean, maybe Apple Intelligence looks good, but it's not going to make me switch to an iPhone. I mean, it's not that much different than what I already have in my Pixel, right? The features they showed off, they're pretty familiar to me at this point. Somebody who lives in the world. Lauren Goode: We should talk about this. And not specific to phones, but just AI in general. Michael Calore: OK, fine. Lauren Goode: Let's do it. [Gadget Lab intro theme music plays] Lauren Goode: Hey, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED. Michael Calore: And I'm Michael Calore. I'm WIRED's director of consumer tech and culture. Lauren Goode: Such a fancy title. I'm still not over your new title. We're also joined this week by WIRED’s senior writer, Will Knight, who has joined us before to talk all about AI. Will, you're so close but so far away. You are dialing in from a hotel room in Cupertino, just about an hour south of where we are. We couldn't bring you into the lab here, but it's nice to have you on this coast. Will Knight: Yeah, thank you for having me. It's nice to be back. Lauren Goode: So today, we're talking about Apple. Yep. This week was WWDC, Apple's Annual Developers Conference. We had people on the ground there in Cupertino like Will. A lot of us were covering it from our desks. If you follow tech news or even if you're just longtime fans of our podcast here, as I'm sure most of you are, then you know how these developer conferences go. There are thousands of app makers gathered in one place where a series of tech executives go on stage and give keynote presentations and then later on host some developer-specific sessions. And it's all about building things on top of the latest and greatest software. And a lot of regular people will watch and listen to it because something like Apple's WWDC is basically going to change the way that your iPhone works. But this year, the conference was different because the last portion of it was entirely about AI, AI, AI, AI. We talk about this a lot on this show, but this is a really important one. Apple has been perceived as ""behind"" in generative AI since OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and a whole bunch of other startups have already made inroads. But is Apple really behind? And what makes Apple AI different? I mean, in addition to the different name they're giving it. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano So Will, based on your very expert opinion, what makes Apple's generative AI different from the others? Will Knight: Well, they are not unveiling a huge language model or a competitor to ChatGPT that's going to be more capable than everybody else's. They're limiting what their AI does. And they're trying to emphasize running AI on devices, which is part of their whole privacy and security marketing thing partly. So in a sense, they are behind and then they've not unveiled anything that's as capable as ChatGPT, but I do think that you're right to question whether they're really that behind because the stuff they've developed running on devices, it's pretty impressive in its own way, and I'm not sure anybody's going to notice that much, the difference between their AI and one of these more powerful models in many instances. Lauren Goode: So they're calling it Apple Intelligence. And as you mentioned, they're not doing what ChatGPT is doing because they didn't develop a separate chatbot or a search engine. This is all happening on your iPhone or another Apple device. Based on the demos that you saw, tell us exactly how it works and what it looks like. Why is this AI any different from other stuff we've been doing on our phones? Will Knight: Yeah. I mean, it's … So I had some demos today, so I got to see some of this Apple Intelligence sprinkled across things, and rather than being a standalone app like Gemini or ChatGPT, as you say, it pervades a lot of different tools. I mean, I think some of it is relatively similar to the stuff that we've seen Google develop, but it seems a little more seamless, a little bit more well-integrated or thoughtfully integrated into devices. So, for example, in your email or in any application in macOS or iOS on a sufficiently advanced device, you can highlight text and then have it summarized or rewrite it in a particular style. It has the ability … You can take a drawing or sketch and turn that into a generative AI image. You can have this thing called Genmoji, create a new emoji for you, which I suspect might be the killer app that nobody really expected. But all of those tools, they don't seem to me to be super, super sophisticated in terms of the capabilities that they're demonstrating. ChatGPT can do a lot more sophisticated text generation or whatever. It's a little bit more like they just seem to be putting the products first, which I think is probably a sensible approach when everybody's getting very obsessed with saying whose AI is bigger or better than the others. But I think that they have quite consciously limited it, which is probably sensible in some ways because the technology is prone to go off the rails and do crazy stuff, which it may well still do. When we see people generating their own emojis, they claim to have put a lot of guardrails out, and I'm sure they have. But no doubt, people will come up with something offensive before too long. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: Yeah, I'm sure you're right. That is going to be the killer app most likely. Lauren Goode: Siri's going to flirt with us. Will Knight: Well, I was asking about this because, obviously, OpenAI's new ChatGPT is notoriously a flirt and they have very consciously not made Siri … They could have actually, I think, added much more emotional emphasis and intonation into the voice. The new Siri they've unveiled with Apple Intelligence behind is much better at handling a conversation. So similar to the new ChatGPT, it can handle pauses and corrections and that will make it much better at being able to take commands, but they very consciously have not made it too emotionally or socially anthropomorphized, I guess. Definitely not a flirt they promised. Michael Calore: The thing that a lot of the voice interaction chatbots have been trying to achieve is this idea of context awareness and it keeps getting better and better. And, obviously, the demos that Apple was showing on stage, which is on a video, is they're prerecorded so they're not live demos. And I'm curious if you had any experience in a live demo with Siri because the thing that is the big advancement that a lot of folks are pointing to, the thing that's really going to change how Siri feels is that context awareness. It's the ability for you to ask a question, get an answer, and then ask a follow-up question without having to repeat the key information, like the name of the movie that you were looking for or the time that you were talking about. It just remembers the things that you had just said within the last 30, 40 seconds. Alexa has been able to do this for a long time. Google's chat assistant has been able to do this for a while. Lauren Goode: I think what Mike is saying is that it's really easy to make a good AI demo. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Does it work? Will Knight: Well, they gave me and some others some demos, but they didn't let us play with it. I mean, it did seem to work better, but, yeah, we'll have to see if it's that much better. The other thing that … They emphasized this idea of it being very personalized, this is one of their key things. They're like, ""It's going to be so much more useful because it draws on your information."" And it seems like Siri can tap into a lot of apps. It can look into those apps and it can also use the automations that you can already do on the iPhone to do some useful stuff. But I didn't see very much in summarizing or rewriting your emails or the interaction in Siri that seemed like it was very personalized. They're very much limiting how much you can train the models based on your data. And I didn't see anything that really struck me as like, ""Wow, that makes it way more useful."" Perhaps it is if you can really get into those apps and do things, but it wasn't clear from the demos. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: Will, you mentioned privacy earlier. One thing that Apple is doing is they've created some private cloud so that when an AI process or request can't happen on the device, it gets offloaded to the cloud. But Apple is saying, “Yeah, but it's with our private servers running on Apple silicon.” Michael Calore: It's the good cloud. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Explain how this works. Will Knight: Right. So, yeah, they've talked about this and put out this white paper showing how when a query does go off to the cloud, information is kept in some secure part of the silicon and they've got this whole architecture which is meant to be verified, but it's secure so outsiders can verify that it's all secure and everything is encrypted end to end. So in theory, it provides you with some assurance that your data is not being handed off to someone else or couldn't leak out in theory. But interestingly, in the demos they gave, it didn't seem like the model ever handed off to the cloud. It seemed like they're really focusing on doing stuff on device. I'm not sure when they would actually do that. Maybe they're more future proofing this for when they do develop their own much more powerful models. They're talking about this working with the iPhone Pro up in terms of smartphones as well as all the M1 laptops. So it's limiting the devices or work on. So for things like your HomePod won't be able to do some of this stuff and it didn't seem like they would be handing that off to the cloud in a way that would make it more capable. So I think there's some questions about really what the utility is. Obviously, it's a big part of their branding to say that they're very privacy and security focused and it is a problem with generative AI that you're handing your data off to God knows who and use some of these things. So it makes sense to emphasize that. I don't know really how useful that is. I mean, it's also something that other people haven't really shown that much focus on trying to integrate the two, but I think it'll be interesting to see how that really, if that really makes it way more capable, if that works seamlessly because you don't want to be waiting for ages as it tries to talk to the cloud. Lauren Goode: Will, I'm picturing when you're saying that you had these very controlled demos in a room and that everything seemed to be happening on device, I'm guessing that they were just handing all the other queries off to Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas behind the scenes who were just, I don't know, pulling on different punch cards, math cards to run this. That's their private cloud. Will Knight: So it's just humans. Lauren Goode: Yeah, it's just a bunch of humans, but they're wearing all-white jumpsuits. This is very Apple. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: The Mechanical Turk. Lauren Goode: Yeah, exactly. Will Knight: It could be. I didn't ask that. Michael Calore: I think … Lauren, you wrote a story about the fact that you have to have the latest phone, right? iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or the new iPhones that are going to be coming out this fall are the only ones that are going to get these features when the features come out. They're going to come out in beta on iOS 18 and then they'll roll into iOS 18 with an update probably later in the year, mostly 2025 is what we're looking at for all of these. So there will be a bunch of people out there who have the new phone or the best phone from last year, and they'll be able to run these, but if you have an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 14, you can't run it and people feel like it's a bad practice for Apple to do that. It's like cheating people out, encouraging people to upgrade to the latest hardware. Now, normally, I would agree with you because I'm a very cynical person and I see companies using this as an opportunity to get people to go out and spend money on the best smartphones they can buy, which they don't need. A cheap phone is great. But I do think that historically Apple has so heavily prioritized the best user experience. They want it to feel seamless and super fast and amazing every time you use it. And maybe on an iPhone 15 or on an iPhone 14, it's a little slow, a little sluggish, and not as impressive. So they're limiting it. They're putting a gate on it so that you don't have that bad experience. Lauren Goode: I just wish Apple would tell us. I mean, I asked Will, you and I were chatting about it yesterday, and when you were on the ground, you had the chance to ask. I don't know if you ever got a response, but I would just like a clear explanation as to why it is limited to the best devices with the fastest chips. Because otherwise, it does just seem like it's something of a product differentiation strategy that they're going to compel people to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro in the coming months or then in September, the iPhone 16 model. Some of the analysts I spoke to said like this could potentially supercharge the iPhone sales cycle. iPhone sales have been in a slump for a while. And so maybe this is part of a ploy to drive phone sales, but actually that probably wouldn't happen for a while still. It probably wouldn't be a gangbusters thing in September because it's still a relatively unproven AI experience and a lot of people aren't going to care about it. There are going to be just as many consumers, I think, who say a midrange phone or an older phone is just fine. I don't need the Genmoji. I don't need Siri summarizing my 8,700 notifications. I don't need this just yet. And then eventually, it could drive adoption of newer hardware as it becomes more widespread. But just having an understanding exactly of why it needs to be the A17 Pro chip and M1 or M2 Ultra and beyond would be great. Maybe we'll get some documentation on that eventually. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Will Knight: Yeah, I didn't get a clear answer for that. I talked to Brenda Stolyar, our colleague, who heard that it was to do with having a certain amount of RAM on the device, which is further confusing. Yeah, I don't know that it makes that much sense where they've drawn the line. Also, I would have thought the idea of this private compute cloud was that you could hand stuff off if you had an older device. So, yeah, it's … Michael Calore: Yeah, that would make sense. Will Knight: … a bit confusing. Lauren Goode: Right. Will Knight: Well, the features that they've shown don't seem to be the very, very most cutting-edge AI models, and you can run some pretty similarly capable stuff in my experience on older hardware. Well, they maybe just want to sell more iPhones, I guess. Lauren Goode: So it sounds like what's different here is that Apple's Intelligence ""is integrated into their devices, they haven't launched a separate chatbot or search engine."" They're saying it's much more private because a lot of the processing is going to happen on device, and then if not, they're going to offload it to their super special private Apple cloud. And Apple hasn't revealed any massive LLM or something like that that would be comparable to what you'd see with ChatGPT and Gemini and with … What are the others now? Bard, I guess. No, Bard is being- Michael Calore: The Bard is Gemini. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Is that correct, Will? Will Knight: Right, yeah. Lauren Goode: In cloud, yeah. Will Knight: Yeah, they haven't shown off something like that. Also, interestingly, the demo they did, I asked about the copyright of some of the data they were using and it sounded, at least for the image-generating stuff, that they weren't using conventional copyrighted material. They were using stuff they were compensating artists for, this is what they were claiming, and had had their own artists generate stuff. I mean, I think that will limit what you can produce much more and perhaps means you don't need such a large model, but I think their approach to copyright and training might be interesting as well. Lauren Goode: Oh, that's interesting. I'm glad that they're paying artists. I mean, they do have to worry about their bottom line and whether or not they're going to go broke, but that's good to know. All right, let's take a quick break and then we come back, we're going to talk about how Apple AI is similar to other AI products that we've talked about a lot on this show. And then maybe cover some of the other announcements that came out of WWDC. More after the break. [Break] Lauren Goode: OK. So we've already talked about how Apple is trying to distinguish itself from other AI-focused tech companies with the big reveal of Apple Intelligence, but we're also wondering what are the ways in which Apple AI just seems like the same old, same old, just a lot of the stuff we've already been doing on our phones. And Will, we also wanted to ask you about some of the other announcements that came out of WWDC quickly. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano OK. So first, what are some of the ways in which you saw Apple Intelligence and thought, ""Yep, we could already do that?"" Will Knight: Well, I think everything they showed is already something you could do with ChatGPT or another tool if you … Some of the features integrated into email or notes are similar to what Google has shown off in its Docs and Gmail. Even the … The thing that got the biggest cheer, which I was surprised about, was bringing the calculator to the iPad, weirdly. Lauren Goode: Yeah, this was wild. I actually couldn't believe it as I was watching the livestream. I thought it was a sound effect when you're watching an old sitcom and they've got the clapping. I was like, ""Is this an inserted round of cheers from the crowd?"" And the calculator. Will Knight: I'm not lying. A guy right next to me said, ""Oh my god,"" as that was announced, which was pretty impressive. Then they showed writing out equations and drawing a little chart and the ability to interpret that give you an answer, turn that into a real chart, is pretty slick and impressive. And that involves a multimodal model, a model that can use images and read handwriting as well as past language. But that's quite similar to what both OpenAI and Google showed off at their developer events or whatever events recently. So I don't think any of it was beyond what other people have shown. I mean, far from it, it seemed pretty table stakes. And I mean, I do think, though, partly that is probably quite deliberate in that they're trying to avoid the gaffes that seem to come with using this stuff. They're trying to limit it. Apple's not … Or probably doesn't want to be associated with the controversies that happen often with generative AI. So I think they're trying to limit it somewhat in that way. Michael Calore: Another thing that feels like table stakes is Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI. There's ChatGPT built right into the user experience now. So particularly like with a Siri query or a typed query, if you're asking it a question that it can't answer, it says, ""Would you like to ask ChatGPT this question?"" And then you tap yes. And then it goes off and asks ChatGPT that question. So a couple of things. First of all, that's clunky and weird that they built a step into it. I understand why they did that because they want to make it very, very clear that you're no longer using an Apple product. You are now going to use somebody else's product. So if the experience sucks, you can't blame Apple. But also, they hinted that they're going to have other models available at some point. So it's possible that just like you get to pick a browser, you will get to pick an agent, a user agent that you send your requests off to. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: Yeah. And the avatar looks like Sam Altman who was there, by the way. And he'll go down in history as one of the most poly-AI-morous people out there because now he's working with both Microsoft and Apple. I mean, we should do a whole other podcast on Sam Altman, but what a coup. Michael Calore: You came up with a name. Lauren Goode: Poly-AI-morous. That was really bad, wasn't it? Michael Calore: No, it was brilliant. It was brilliant AI and— Lauren Goode: Yeah. But Mike, to your point, it's like, ""Oh, then the alternative option here, ChatGPT,"" which we could all use on our phones anyway. Will Knight: Yeah, it seems to me like it's more about pleasing or appeasing investors and regulators doing that. They're trying to show— Michael Calore: How so? Will Knight: Well, people want to think Apple is at the cutting edge. So they're trying to show that they are by making that available. And then I guess they're running into trouble around having Google as the default search that they're talking about having different AI models available to people. But the demos that they've given, I wonder if the way that they've set it up is it makes ChatGPT that much less useful. They're showing these things like you take a picture of ... I mean, I don't really know how people use ChatGPT that much, but take a picture of some vegetables and then ask what to make for dinner. I mean, do people really do that? It seems you have to be slightly mad to do that, I would say. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it's a funny hedge, it seems. Lauren Goode: Will, were there any announcements not related to Apple Intelligence that you heard firsthand at the event and you thought, ""That sounds pretty nifty. I'm into that?"" Will Knight: I like the real-time translate on your watch, on the Apple Watch, weirdly. Lauren Goode: Are you an Apple Watch wearer? Will Knight: I do have an Apple Watch, but I've also traveled a bunch and I tried to use … In China, they used to sell these things that would … They used deep learning models to recognize your speech, but then this was pre-large language models, so try and translate things, but you'd say something to somebody and then play it and they'd be like, ""What are you talking about?"" And then they'd say something back and it would get even more garbled. And it was … But in principle, it seemed like a cool idea. And I think if you try the latest ChatGPT and said, ""Tell it to translate,"" I think they're pretty impressive. And so I thought that could be quite useful. Obviously, the calculator was a huge deal for me. Lauren Goode: Oh my god. Will Knight: There were a lot of … My first WWDC and I was amazed at how many gasps there were in the crowd when they announced a new little widget or icon or something. Seemed pretty crazy. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: So the NIPS Conference isn't like that? Will Knight: The which conference? Lauren Goode: The NIPS Conference. NIPS. Will Knight: NeurIPS. Lauren Goode: NeurIPS, oops. It used to be called NIPS, wasn't it? Will Knight: They used to, be called that, they had to change it. Lauren Goode: And it changed. Will Knight: Yes. Lauren Goode: Tell us about how NeurIPS compares. Will Knight: NeurIPS is a little more— Michael Calore: You might want to retake that. Lauren Goode: It's OK. Leave it in. So you're saying it's different from the NeurIPS Conference. Will Knight: It's a bit different from that, yeah. NeurIPS is the premier AI conference, which has become ridiculous because there's so much AI research happening and it's all very, very in the weeds focused on the latest models and capabilities and training data and all this stuff. So, yes, very different to that for me. It was fun to be there. I was amazed that they basically pulled you all together and then just play a video at you. It seems ridiculous. Like something from Silicon Valley. Lauren Goode: I mean, you flew across the country for that, Will. Will Knight: Yeah. I did wonder what was going on. Lauren Goode: What about messaging? We should talk about messaging because I think that's one of the biggest announcements. Michael Calore: I would love to talk about messaging. First of all, the fact that you can satellite message for non-emergency situations, I think, is very cool. There's not a lot of detail about how this is going to work and a lot of people have tons of questions about this, but basically, if you don't have a data connection and you want to send a text or receive a text, you can just open a satellite connection and send a text or receive a text. Apple has been providing two years of free satellite messaging for emergency situations with iPhones. We do not know whether or not that is going to be extended to non-emergency situations. Probably not. Might require a plan. Maybe you can get pay as you go, but people want to know, can I use it … Is it just for the wilderness? Is it just for places where there is no connection or can I use it at places where the Wi-Fi sucks or where the reception sucks? Like at a concert when there's 60,000 people, you often can't send a text message because all of the tubes are so clogged. Lauren Goode: Or on a plane. Michael Calore: Or on an airplane. Can I use it there? All kinds of questions about that. So people are very excited. They want to know everything about satellite messaging. I think they're probably not going to get what they want. Lauren Goode: Well, it's going to cost money, I think. Michael Calore: Yes. And … By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: That's my guess. Michael Calore: … I'd be shocked if they let you use it on airplanes. Lauren Goode: Well, airplanes, I think it would be the most useful just for 2FA. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: Have you ever had that experience where this happens a lot? I go to log in to my Condé email when I'm on a plane and I get … Mike's shaking his head. Michael Calore: No. Lauren Goode: And I'm not logged in, so I'm like, ""OK, I got to log in,"" and then I have to authenticate and I'm waiting for the 2FA code and I can't get it because it comes via SMS. Michael Calore: Yeah, no. Lauren Goode: Why are you saying no? It's not happened to you? Michael Calore: No, I don't work on airplanes. Airplanes are me time. Lauren Goode: Who are you? What have you done with Michael? Michael Calore: I'm a person who does not work on air … I've never worked on an airplane. Lauren Goode: What do you do on airplanes? Michael Calore: I read, I sleep, I listen to podcasts, I stare out the window. Lauren Goode: Watch B movies. Michael Calore: Yeah, no, I watch excellent movies. Lauren Goode: Do you cry? Michael Calore: Sometimes. Lauren Goode: Just in general or from the movies? Michael Calore: From the Apple Vision Pro putting pressure on my face. Lauren Goode: Touche. Well, sometimes I work … All right. Sometimes I don't want to work and I just want to spend the time clearing out my inbox. Michael Calore: Yeah, that's still work. Lauren Goode: It is, but it's mindless work. It's just like batch select, mark as spam, delete. Michael Calore: That's what Uber rides are for. Lauren Goode: No, I get nauseous in the back of an Uber when I do that. Anyway. I really hope this satellite messaging works on planes, but you know people are going to abuse that, right? Let's say there's … Not abuse it, that's not the right word, but … Michael Calore: Oh, sure. Lauren Goode: … what is deemed essential will be different for different people. Michael Calore: Oh, yes. Lauren Goode: Someone's in a massive fight with their spouse and they're like, ""I got a text right now,"" or something like that, versus, ""I need to make an emergency call."" Michael Calore: I'm sure all of us have been in a situation where we either send or receive a text right before they tell us that we have to go into airplane mode and then we spend the entire rest of the airplane ride with our brains spinning. Imagine if that was a thing of the past. Imagine if you didn't have to worry about that anymore. You could just— Lauren Goode: It's too soon. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: You could just send a text message. Lauren Goode: Genmoji. Michael Calore: Genmoji, not interested. We should talk about RCS. Lauren Goode: Oh, we should. We should talk about it for approximately four seconds because that's how long Apple spent talking about it on stage, despite the fact that it's one of the things people are most interested in, RCS being rich communication service, which is, a … I'm having word retrieval issues right now. What's the … not a platform. It's a … Michael Calore: Protocol. Lauren Goode: … standard … It's a protocol. Thank you very much. It's a protocol. This reminds me of the episode we did with Will a few weeks back. It's a protocol that is supposed to bridge the gaps that exist between iPhone blue bubble text messaging and Android text messaging. By the way, most people around the world have an Android phone and rely on other messaging apps to message each other. Anyway. But iMessage has this lock, this grip on iPhone users, because it uses Apple's data network and then all the messages that you can send from iPhone to iPhone, you have all these cool features, but those don't translate to your green bubble friends on Android. RCS was supposed to level the playing field for that. It's a standard or a protocol that Google was very much behind. They had gotten the wireless carriers on board. And so then last year, at some point, Apple said, ""Fine, we'll support RCS."" This was largely seen as a response to some of the regulation that's happening in the EU around tech companies and to pressure here in the States on Apple to be more fair about the whole messaging thing, but they just glossed over it. They're like, ""Oh, and by the way, RCS support. OK, let's move on."" Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: And then there was … It was a little icon on a page of all the things that the new iOS is going to have. Michael Calore: Yeah. I'm not holding out hope that Apple's implementation is going to be excellent. I am ready to be surprised by that. I'm being open-minded about it. The big thing is that it's secure end-to-end encrypted conversations between devices. But the other thing is that if you're on an Android phone and you're talking to a bunch of people with iPhones, group texts don't work, videos come in as crunchy, little pixelated shit storms. They don't look like real actual videos. It's very annoying. And if they can just fix some of those minor annoyances that make the two platforms more interoperable, then everybody will be OK. There will be world peace and we can all move on with our lives. Lauren Goode: That's just the bare minimum. Plus, secure. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: That's it. Michael Calore: I think people don't care. People have been trading security for features for eons. And I think that as long as they can just make it work, it doesn't have to … I mean, if it's RCS, it will be secure, but I don't think that people are that concerned about security. I think they're more concerned about— By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Lauren Goode: Do you think they're just journalist nerds who care about it? Michael Calore: I just want to see your cat photo. Lauren Goode: Yeah, or something else. Michael Calore: Or I just don't want to be left out. Lauren Goode: Right. Right. Or I don't want to be the person who's on the group thread who's accused of making everything worse because I'm the person on Android. Michael Calore: Yeah, because it's not my fault, it's Apple's fault. I'm sorry I'm making this personal. Lauren Goode: No, I think that's OK. Michael Calore: Speaking of personalized experiences. Lauren Goode: I think this is very fair. Will, do you have group chats where there's some ... You must because you're from the UK. Our producer's telling us that we are definitely out of time, but now I need to know the answer, Will, because you're from the UK. And presumably, you have lots of friends over there. And so do you have group chats where people are on Android? Will Knight: They tend to be on WhatsApp, honestly. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: See, that's exactly it. Michael Calore: There you go. Will Knight: WhatsApp is so popular in England. Yeah. Michael Calore: Yep. Lauren Goode: And you could do all those fun things in WhatsApp, too. You can record voice notes and do tap backs and emoji and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Will Knight: Just wait until you get the first Genmoji and then you'll be rushing to update your hardware. Lauren Goode: I know. I have an iPhone 15. That's the thing about not really reviewing phones anymore, which I did for a decade of my life, is that I feel not at all compelled to get the newest phone anymore. Michael Calore: You have to buy them like a plebian. Oh, you're saying you’re OK with it. Lauren Goode: Just myself. Yeah. I'm OK. And so I have the 15, I don't have the Pros, so I'm going to have to figure that out. I do think I'm going to be a little bit … I don't know about Genmoji as much as tapbacks. I'm convinced people these days have entire relationships through tapbacks and that's OK. I'm OK with that. Will Knight: Can you use a Genmoji in your tapback phone? Can you— Lauren Goode: I think you can. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: I think you can. I think you can, right? Will Knight: That's the dream. Lauren Goode: Right. Yeah. Will Knight: That's the generative dream. Lauren Goode: Yeah, that's the … Well, I'm glad we've established that, Will. Papers upon papers about the advances of artificial intelligence and we have arrived at Genmoji as a tapback is the dream. It's what we've always wanted. Will, thank you so much for this. Stick around. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, we're going to do our recommendations. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano [Break] Lauren Goode: All right. Will, as our guest of honor, what is your recommendation this week? Will Knight: OK. I'm going to recommend this software framework called AutoGen, which is relatively straightforward to use. It's from Microsoft and it lets several AI models or personas of a language model work together to solve a task. It's interesting because there's been a bunch of papers that have came out at research conferences and so on showing that when models work together, sometimes they can solve things that one model can't on its own, and sometimes they can be much more reliable. And this is quite fun because you can create different personas in the models and watch them go back and forth and argue with each other, which I find entertaining, even if no one else does. Michael Calore: Apocalyptic. Will Knight: Yeah, a little bit. Michael Calore: So it's like teamwork. Teamwork makes the dream work. Will Knight: Yes. Right. That's the idea. I mean, it's interesting because, to some degree, it's really just about, rather than this being humans that are working together. And actually, what it's really doing in a way is providing a clever way to refine the prompt that goes into a model. So it's not clear if you really need to have different models working together as teams or whether you really just need a much better way to interrogate these models, which is what that enables. But it's fun … I think it's really interesting that people are experimenting with these different tools. Maybe the future of Apple Intelligence is a lot of different series arguing over what to recommend for dinner or working together or something like that. Lauren Goode: Agents. “Agents.” Will Knight: Right. Lauren Goode: And how can someone find AutoGen? Will Knight: I'd recommend googling AutoGen because I can't remember— Lauren Goode: How do you spell that? Will Knight: A-U-T-O-G-E-N. And you'll find the GitHub page where you can download and play with it. Michael Calore: Ooh, tarballs. Lauren Goode: Fun. Michael Calore: Great. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Will Knight: Absolutely. Lauren Goode: And it's free, Will? Will Knight: It's free, yeah. Lauren Goode: It's on GitHub. Yeah. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: OK. Thanks for that. Mike, what's your recommendation? Michael Calore: I would like to recommend the Klean Kanteen Rise Food Box. Lauren Goode: That just sounds like you went to a word generator and spit up a bunch of words. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: OK. Tell the people what this is. Michael Calore: So Klean Kanteen, that's Klean Kanteen with a K and a K. They make water bottles. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Michael Calore: They make other things, too, like travel mugs and shot glasses or whatever. Lauren Goode: Yeah, the Kardashians are behind it, right? It's a K, all the Ks. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: I have no idea. Lauren Goode: I'm just kidding. I made that up. Michael Calore: OK. Lauren Goode: It is the K thing. OK, please continue. Michael Calore: All right. So they make these food boxes that are basically like bento boxes, they're lunch boxes, and you pack them with food and you take them to work. We have returned to the office here at WIRED. I'm sure many people listening have returned to the office and maybe the catering system that you had before Covid is no longer around and you need to bring your lunch. What I'm saying is they're very useful for people who need to eat food during the work day. They're metal, which is very nice. They're also microwave safe. You can put them in the microwave to heat up your lunch. You have to take the lid off. The lid is not microwave safe. But my favorite thing about them is that they have this really powerful rubber seal. It's like a silicone ring around the lid that seals and then tabs that fold down and hold it down. Now, I ride my bike to and from work, so I'm always carrying my lunch in my bicycle bag. There's all kinds of problems with spilling if I use all of the different food boxes that I've had over the years. This one does not spill. And that's why I'm recommending it. The seal on it is excellent. It feels flimsy and you're like, ""I don't really know,"" but I've been using it for months now and not one spill. So I'm amazed. My bag, for the first time in my life, does not smell like kimchi. It just smells like a regular cycling bag. So, yeah, the Klean Kanteen Rise Food Box. I should note that Klean Kanteen made food boxes before this one that do not have the excellent seal on them. Those are also good, but I have— Lauren Goode: But you don't want to ride your bike with them. Michael Calore: Those have … I've encountered spills with those. Lauren Goode: OK. Michael Calore: The new version, the one that's out this year, 2024, that's the good one. Lauren Goode: How much does that cost approximately? Michael Calore: I have the one that's the medium size and I think it was $35. Lauren Goode: OK. Michael Calore: Which sounds like a lot. Lauren Goode: It's worth it. Michael Calore: But totally worth it. Lauren Goode: Yeah. That's a great recommendation. Michael Calore: Well, thank you. Lauren, what's your recommendation? Lauren Goode: My recommendation is the Lunya washable silk sleep mask. Michael Calore: Ooh. Lauren Goode: Ooh. Sorry to sound like an infomercial. I should hold it up and you go, “Ooh, tell me more.” Michael Calore: Say more. Lauren Goode: You were actually a part of this thread when I got the Lunya. Do you remember this? By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: I do. Lauren Goode: Ooh. First, I'll tell you about the mask, which is, if you use a sleep mask or you're thinking about using a sleep mask, you can look up all kinds of different options. And I'm telling you, this one is probably the best. I mean, I haven't tried that many, but it's soft, it's pillowy, it's not too tight on your face. It's silk, so it's smooth. It's washable. It is just honestly one of the most comfortable sleep masks I've ever used. It has been game-changing for me. I was not really a sleep mask person before, but recently, I had a birthday and I was having a small birthday dinner and I brought this up to a group of friends who were all on a group chat, which was, yep, it turned green because Mike's on a Pixel. So at this dinner, I was saying to friends, ""Have any of you used a sleep mask? And if so, what's your pick?"" And everyone's, ""Oh, sure, yeah, we use sleep masks."" And I was thinking, ""OK, well, I'm going to go home and I'm going to buy one for myself for my birthday."" I was very tired. I was not drunk, I was just tired. And I passed out while I was googling sleep masks. And the next day, I got a notification saying, ""Your Lunya shipment is on the way."" So I thought, ""Wow, I was really out of it."" And I ordered a sleep mask for myself. Congratulations to me. And I wrote to you guys on the thread and I was like, ""You guys, I am such a dope. I was falling asleep last night and I ordered this Lunya thing."" When it arrived, of course, I opened the box and there was a note from one of my dear friends on there saying, ""Happy birthday. You said you wanted a sleep mask."" So actually, what had happened is that someone on the group thread had ordered it for me and I just thought I … I don't know. I was like a drunk wine mom without the wine. Michael Calore: And then they let you believe that you had sleep ordered it. Lauren Goode: Yes, which was the best part. That was actually the best part of the surprise was that for days, she just let me think that I did that. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Yeah. So love my Lunya. I highly recommend if you're looking for a sleep mask. I think that model, I think it's expensive. It's like 50 bucks. Michael Calore: Oh wow. Lauren Goode: Expensive for a sleep mask. Michael Calore: This person really cares about you. Lauren Goode: Yeah, but there are versions that are closer to 35, I think. So I don't know, it's a tossup between the Klean Kanteen and the Lunya sleep mask. What matters more, a good night's sleep or spill-free Kanteen? By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Michael Calore: Hot lunch. Lauren Goode: Hot lunch, baby. This all sound like euphemisms right now. OK, let's wrap up the show. Boone is dying. Our producer, poor Boone. Thank you, Will, for joining us and for tolerating us. This was really fun. Will Knight: You're very welcome. Thanks for having me. Lauren Goode: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can leave us a review. All I ask of you is that even if you don't like the show, you can write that, but give us five stars anyway because that helps our rating. But if you have other feedback, you can also find all of us on social media. We're very responsive there. Just check the show notes and we'll put our handles in. The show is produced by the excellent Boone Ashworth. Goodbye for now and we'll be back next week. [Gadget Lab outro theme music plays] Will Knight: There was a … I did come across an app that promises to translate your speech into cat. Lauren Goode: Into cat? Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Is it just meow, meow, meow, meow? Will Knight: You have to pay for it. I haven't paid for it. Can I still recommend it? Michael Calore: Yes. Boone Ashworth: Is it CatGPT? Lauren Goode: Is it CatGPT? Will Knight: It's not called Cat … I have to find out what it's called now. I've downloaded it, but I was like, ""Oh, god, I've got to pay?"" Lauren Goode: I'll do it for free. Send me your prompt. What's your question, Mike? I'm CatGPT, send me your question. Michael Calore: Oh, can I say a command? Lauren Goode: Yeah, sure. Michael Calore: All right. Go back to sleep. Lauren Goode: Meow, meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. There you go. Will Knight: That wasn't … That was something quite different."
73,Steven Levy,"If Ray Kurzweil Is Right (Again), You’ll Meet His Immortal Soul in the Cloud",https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-ray-kurzweil/,The famed futurist remains inhumanly optimistic about the world and his own fate—and thinks the singularity is minutes away.,2024-06-13T10:00:00Z,"By Steven Levy Ray Kurzweil rejects death. The 76-year-old scientist and engineer has spent much of his time on earth arguing that humans can not only take advantage of yet-to-be-invented medical advances to live longer, but also ultimately merge with machines, become hyperintelligent, and stick around indefinitely. Nonetheless, death cast a shadow over my interview with Kurzweil this spring. Just minutes before we met, we both learned that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize–winning psychologist and one of Kurzweil’s intellectual jousting partners, had suffered that fate. A few days before that, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge had also passed. Vinge’s novels first described the singularity, that moment when superintelligent AI surpasses what humans can do and mere mortals need high-tech augmentation themselves to remain relevant. Kurzweil embraced the name for his own grand vision, and in 2005 wrote a best-selling book called The Singularity Is Near. He was by then an accomplished inventor and entrepreneur who had made breakthroughs in optical character recognition, synthesizer technology, and high-tech tools to boost accessibility. He’s racked up numerous honors—the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the $500,000 Lemelson–MIT Prize, a Grammy. In 2012, Google hired him to head an AI lab. Back then, many people regarded his predictions as over the top. Computers achieving human-level intelligence by 2029? Way too soon! In the age of generative AI, that timeline seems conventional, if not conservative. So it’s not surprising that Kurzweil’s new book, out this month, is called The Singularity Is Nearer. A lot of the dotted lines in the first book’s charts have now been filled in—and are impressively on the mark. Still, even though I’m bowled over by the technological advances that Kurzweil correctly predicted, I have trouble wrapping my (unaugmented) mind around his sunny scenario of our disembodied brains thriving hundreds of years from now in some kind of cloud consciousness. Kurzweil had suggested we meet at the public library in Newton, Massachusetts, near his home. He showed up wearing bright suspenders and a remarkably full head of hair—kind of a Geppetto look, appropriate for someone trying to promote artificial beings to human status. We weaved our way through stacks of books—destined to become fodder for the robots we’d one day share consciousness with—to a room he’d reserved. As we spoke, Kurzweil periodically reached into a backpack to pull out a few charts, all showing dramatic improvements in domains ranging from computing power to average global income. We spent the afternoon talking about what immortality would be like, what he does at Google, and, of course, the looming singularity. I’ve got some sad news. Did you hear that Daniel Kahneman died? Yeah. I heard that like five minutes ago. I've met with him a number of times. How old was he? Ninety. Oh, really? Nowadays people in their nineties can seem fine. Take my aunt. A psychologist, with a full assembly of patients she saw on a regular basis. At 98! She still had a sense of humor. I called her up once and she asked me, “So what are you doing?” I told her I gave a speech about longevity escape velocity. That's where scientific progress undoes the passage of time. So you don't really use up time as you age. You do use up a year, every year, but you get back at least one year from scientific progress. We're not there yet, but that's what we're going for. And she said, “Could we hurry up with that?” That was actually the last conversation we had, because she died two weeks later. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Ray Kurzweil takes about 80 pills a day to keep his health up. You seem to be at war with biology. Biology has a lot of limitations. A lot of analysts feel there's nothing inevitable about dying, and we're coming up with things to stop it. Basically we can get rid of death through aging. Some people think that something like 120 might be a hard stop for a human, but you think differently? Absolutely. There's no reason to stop at 120. What is the upper bound? There is no upper bound. Once we get past the singularity, we'll be able to put some AI connections inside our own brain. It’s not going to be literally inside the brain, it's going to connect to the cloud. The advantage of a cloud is it's completely backed up. You’re 76. Do you think you're going to live to see escape velocity? Yeah. I’m in good shape. I actually measure where I am. If something is down, I take various prescriptions or medications to get back to being on the positive side of longevity. I’m up to about 80 pills a day. [That’s actually down from around 200, circa 2008.] The last time we talked I mentioned Steve Jobs’ commencement speech at Stanford, where he called death “nature’s greatest invention,” clearing the way for the new. You called it a death-ist position. Do you still see it that way? It's better not to die. We're not using up any resources that can't be replaced. The amount of sunlight that falls on Earth is 10,000 times what we need to create all of our energy. We'll use AI to create food and so on. So it's not like we’re running out of resources. If I'm 300 years old, what will my life be like? Everything I grew up with would be different. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Look at the change we’ve already experienced. Certainly 20 years ago, you didn't have a smartphone, and you probably had a very primitive computer. If you're talking about hundreds of years, life is going to be enormously different. You're going have new experiences that are impossible today. But my true identity—the me that you want to keep going forever—was formed by the strong connections that I made in childhood. It seems random that I’ll still be dealing with that centuries later. They say all your favorite songs are the songs you listened to when you were 14. When I'm 500 years old, am I going to be listening to the Rolling Stones for the billionth time? There's going to be new music. There's new music now. I still listen to the Rolling Stones. I listen to the Rolling Stones too. But there are new artists I appreciate. We'll also be able to do things we couldn't do before because our minds are going to expand. We're going to be attached to what we call a large language model, though I don't like that name, because large language models don’t just deal with language. We'll be able to basically download knowledge and appreciate it. But there is an arc to life. I'll never be young again, no matter how healthy I may feel at age 150 or age 300. Maybe that’s why if you live until your nineties, death seems less scary. You can say that, but when it comes time, you want to continue to live. People say, “Well, I don't want to live past 99.” But when they get to 99, they have a different view of it. If they wanted to die, they could die, and they don't die, unless they're in unbearable pain. You must be the only person who wasn't surprised when ChatGPT came out. It follows the timeline you laid out in the last century. That's true. I made that prediction in 1999. Some people at Stanford found that amazing. I guess I had enough credibility that they established a conference to discuss my opinion. If you look at the speeches then, they were all saying, “Yes, human-level intelligence will happen, but not in 30 years. It will happen in 100 years.” Just recently, the predictions have come down. I say it’s only five years away. Some people say it'll happen next year. How will we know when AGI is here? That's a very good question. I mean, I guess in terms of writing, ChatGPT’s poetry is actually not bad, but it's not up to the best human poets. I'm not sure whether we'll achieve that by 2029. If it's not happening by then, it'll happen by 2032. It may take a few more years, but anything you can define will be achieved because AI keeps getting better and better. You believe that AI will write better novels than humans. But if you give people an amazing novel that changes their lives, and then tell them a robot wrote it, they will feel cheated. The human connection they felt while reading it was fraudulent. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams I'm aware that there’s a prejudice against that. But it's not going to just be LLMs, or whatever we're going to call them, who will write the novels. We're going to combine with them. People will still look like humans, with normal human skin. But they will be a combination of the brains we're born with, as well as the brains that computers have, and they will be much smarter. When they do something, we will consider them human. We'll all have superhumans within our brains. Even after reading your book, I'm a little fuzzy about how that cloud connection happens. Let's say you do get to escape velocity, and you're living in 2050. How will your brain merge with the cloud? That’s a big issue. A lot of things occur to you and you're not aware of where they came from. That'll be true of the additional computer mind that we connect ourselves to. There are people working on this now, actually being able to put things inside the brain for people who can't communicate with their own bodies. It needs to be faster than it is today. And I believe that will happen by the 2030s. When would you start connecting a child to the cloud? That's a good question. There are other ways to get inside the brain without doing it sort of mechanically. Do you think that the successors to LLMs will have what we call consciousness? To understand what's conscious and what isn't, you have to adopt a philosophical point of view. For 50 years, Marvin Minsky was my mentor. Whenever consciousness came up, he said, don’t talk to me about that, that's nonsense, it’s not scientific. He was correct that there's no scientific definition of it. But it's not nonsense, because it's actually the most important issue. Blake Lemoine, who says he worked in your lab at Google, contends that the LLM you were working on, LaMDA, was conscious. Was he wrong? I’ve never called him wrong. I think he loves language models. You could consider them conscious—I think they're not quite there yet. But they will be there. It's really a matter of your philosophical point of view, whether they're conscious or not. We will get to the point—and this is not 100 years from now, it's like a few years—where they will act and respond just the way humans do. And if you say that they're not conscious, you'd have to say humans aren't conscious. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams What have you been doing at Google? It’s always been a bit mysterious. It started when I had a conversation with Bill Gates. He had read my book How to Create a Mind and wanted to actually create that in a computer. But I had just started a company two weeks earlier. Then [Google’s ex-CEO] Larry Page was interested in the company, and we did a deal wtih Google to buy it. So I came here and started a group called Descartes. We did a lot of work that eventually became part of large language models. Maybe seven years ago, we trained a model to read 200,000 books and answer any questions. It got to a point where I was supervising around 40 people. That involved a lot of bureaucracy. My boss said, “What you would really like to do is come up with ideas.” So I'm now advising on AI—providing my ideas to the CEO and other people. My views are taken more seriously because things I've said in the past have come true. You mentioned earlier that we will be able to upload our brains to a machine and have a backup version of ourselves. That creation could be our replicant, and stand in for us if we die. I find it disturbing to have more than one of me. The real you is a function of your physical brain as well as your electronic brain. This is just a copy of that. What's wrong with having a copy? Conceivably, you could churn out many copies. Then it’s a race to get home first to see which version of you has dinner with your spouse. Yeah, there will be issues you have to deal with. I don't have all the answers. This is where Daniel Kahneman comes in. In your book you describe conversations you two had about a transition between our world and the singularity. You thought that society would be able to handle the transition, but Kahneman argued that it would be full of tumult, even violence. Yeah, he thought there'd be conflict. I was more optimistic. I'm not saying that everything's going to be perfect, but would you want to go back to, say, several hundred years ago, when our lifespan was around 30? When we had no electronics at all, and no one could remember anything, and we hadn't invented the record player? Life was pretty terrible. We’re much happier now. And I've got 50 different graphs that show everything has gotten better. People don't remember that. I'm worried that we're going back to a more dangerous time, and AI in the hands of bad actors might make it worse. In your book you concede that AI might wreak more havoc than World War II. Yes, I talk about the perils. But I think they’re unlikely. People who are negative about AI say that we have no way of dealing with these issues. Well, that's because we haven't had to deal with them yet. We will have the added intelligence to think about avoiding the perils. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams You put a stake in the ground with your book The Singularity Is Near. This one is called The Singularity Is Nearer. How do you define the singularity? To me it’s when a human will not only be able to do everything that other people can do, but also create something new, like curing certain forms of cancer. AI is integral to doing that, because you can actually try out every single possible combination of things that might cure cancer. And instead of asking which one of those billions of possible cures are we going to try, we can try them all, and we can simulate them in a few days. The singularity is when we can actually combine that kind of thinking with our normal thinking, and we will then become superhuman. If we get to that point where we’re all merged with superintelligent systems, will there still be huge personal fortunes, or will income inequality be mitigated at that point? What's the difference between, say, us and billionaires? They can sell companies and so on. But in terms of our ability to enjoy the fruits of life, it's pretty much the same. More than half the people in the United States can’t come up with $500 for an emergency. Are you confident that the social safety net, and universal basic income and programs like that, will equally share this promised abundance? The safety net has expanded enormously. It's hundreds of programs. And it's going to keep doing that. Is that guaranteed? No. It depends on decisions that we make, and what kind of political systems we deploy. Once we get to AGI, computers will be able to do anything, including cleaning the dishes and coming up with poetry—anything you say, these machines can do. Your views strike me as Panglossian. Do you feel that humans are essentially good? Yes. Out of all of this turmoil, we've gotten technology, which never would have happened without brains combined with opposable thumbs. Good things happen. You could argue that we're destroying the planet. Well, no. Within 10 years we’ll come up with renewable energy that doesn't produce carbon dioxide. Look, we’re going through a very big change. People—not just scientists and philosophers—are asking, “How are we going to handle this?” I think those changes will continue to be positive. We don’t have to worry about it. Vernor Vinge, who first fleshed out the singularity concept, also died recently. Were you in touch with him? I was in touch with him along the way. I think the last time was probably 10 years ago. How old was he? I think he was in his eighties. [Kurzweil reaches for his phone.] Yeah, check that part of your brain. [Looking at the screen] OK, he was born in ’44. just died in ’24. Seventy-nine. It’s fairly young. Updated 06-14-24, 5:45 am ET: This story was updated to clarify Kurzweil's duties at Google.

74,Megan Farokhmanesh,'Cities: Skylines II' Found a Solution for High Rents: Get Rid of Landlords,https://www.wired.com/story/cities-skylines-ii-found-a-solution-for-high-rents-removing-landlords/,"For months, players have been complaining about the high rents in the city-building sim. This week, developer Colossal Order fixed the problem by doing something real cities can’t: removing landlords.",2024-06-14T17:45:27Z,"Megan Farokhmanesh The rent is too damn high, even in video games. For months, players of Colossal Order’s 2023 city-building sim, Cities: Skylines II, have been battling with exorbitant housing costs. Subreddits filled with users frustrated that the cost of living was too high in their burgeoning metropolises and complained there was no way to fix it. This week, the developer finally announced a solution: tossing the game’s landlords to the curb. “First of all, we removed the virtual landlord so a building’s upkeep is now paid equally by all renters,” the developer posted in a blog on the game’s Steam page. “Second, we changed the way rent is calculated.” Now, Colossal Order says, it will be based on a household’s income: “Even if they currently don’t have enough money in their balance to pay rent, they won’t complain and will instead spend less money on resource consumption.” The rent problem in the city sim is almost a little too on-the-nose. Over the lpast few years, real-world rents have skyrocketed—in some cases, rising faster than wages. In cities like New York, advocates and tenants alike are fighting against the fees making housing less and less affordable; in the UK, rent is almost 10 percent higher than it was a year ago. From Hawaii to Berlin the cost of living is exorbitant. Landlords aren’t always to blame, but for renters they’re often the easiest targets. From this perspective, perhaps Cities’ simulator is too good. Prior to this week’s fix, players found themselves getting tripped up on some of the same problems government officials and city planners are facing. “For the love of god I can not fix high rent,” wrote one player in April. “Anything I do re-zone, de-zone, more jobs, less jobs, taxes high or low, wait time in game. Increased education, decreased education. City services does nothing. It seems anything I try does nothing.” On the game’s subreddit, players have also criticized “how the game's logic around ‘high rent’ contrasts reality,” with one player conceding that centralized locations with amenities will inevitably have higher land values. “But this game makes the assumption of a hyper-capitalist hellscape where all land is owned by speculative rent-seeking landlord classes who automatically make every effort to make people homeless over provisioning housing as it is needed,” the player continued. “In the real world, socialised housing can exist centrally.” This is true. It exists in Vienna, which The New York Times last year dubbed “a renters’ utopia.” Except, in Vienna the landlord is the city itself (it owns about 220,000 apartments). In Cities: Skylines II, the devs just got rid of landlords completely. The change in-game will have “a transition period as the simulation adapts to the changes,” Colossal Order says in its blog, and the developer says it “can’t make any guarantees” with how it will impact games with mods. Although the update aims to fix most of the problems at hand, that doesn’t mean players should never expect to see rent complaints again. When household incomes are too low to pay, tenants will be loud about it. “Only when their income is too low to be able to pay rent will they complain about ‘High Rent’ and look for cheaper housing or move out of the city.” Maybe it’s time players had a few in-game tenant groups of their own.

75,Jason Parham,The Anderson Cooper of Black Twitter Believes Journalism Can Survive Influencers,https://www.wired.com/story/dial-up-phil-lewis/,Editor and news aggregator Phil Lewis isn’t afraid of YouTubers or TikTokkers. He says the real threat is misinformation.,2024-06-14T15:00:00Z,"Jason Parham Phil Lewis never planned on leaving Michigan. Detroit was home. Still, he wasn’t exactly happy with the life he’d built, he tells me recently over Zoom. After graduating from Michigan State University, where he studied sociology, Lewis cycled through Teach for America and landed a gig as an elementary school educator, teaching seventh-grade history and social studies. But it wasn’t enough. “I was kind of devastated a little bit because I just didn’t really know what I was supposed to be doing,” he says. This was around 2015, a bellwether year in digital media. Everything about the news industry was evolving at a volatile speed, as sites like BuzzFeed and Gawker chased virality, and legacy publications tried to keep stride. By that point, Twitter was the front page of the internet. Grassroots movements spurred by political and economic corruption—the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter—had recast the platform into ground zero for breaking news. Social media was ushering in a new age of citizen journalism. Lewis, with his 30,000 followers, decided to jump in. “Vine was still a thing. Influencing was a relatively new concept. I was a teacher with a decent following. A friend of mine was like, ‘You should get into social media.’” That was almost a decade ago. Today, Lewis is behind one of the most popular—and most reliable—news accounts on X. He also landed a more traditional media gig, as a front page editor for HuffPost. Lewis has a sixth sense for news, and has made himself into an indispensable voice on an app that, these days, is drowning in noise (having 409,000 followers doesn’t hurt either). He did so by sticking to a particular formula: platforming overlooked and underrepresented stories with more context, humanness, and understanding. “I don’t want to bring attention to everything because there’s so much engagement bait online now,” Lewis says. “What I try to avoid doing is lighting something on fire.” In 2022, following Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, and its subsequent rebranding as X, users furiously debated the platform’s demise, and many wondered how apocalyptic its loss would be for independent and nontraditional media. Twitter was the internet’s newspaper—who would fill that void if it was suddenly gone? What wasn’t up for debate was Lewis’s impact. “You know where Black people on here get their news???? This guy,” @solomonmissouri tweeted, referencing his account. Added @AkanButNoJeezyy: “And @Phil_Lewis_ does not miss, okay?! One time for the Black Anderson Cooper.” Their point being: Who tells your story matters. It is a lesson Lewis has never lost sight of. Jason Parham: Is it still possible—in 2024—to achieve the kind of career and presence you have online? Phil Lewis: It’d be really hard. I wasn’t competing with so many different voices. I think [journalist] Taylor Lorenz coined this term, but newsfluencers weren’t a thing back then. At least in my mind, it wasn’t. But now there’s all sorts of people who do it or want to do it. My trajectory also coincided with the rise of digital news outlets. I rose with that. HuffPost and BuzzFeed had been around, but people were trying to figure out what it meant to find news and to surface news on social media. Today, it wouldn’t be impossible, but it would be very difficult to go from a middle school teacher to working as a front-page editor at a news outlet where I have created my own lane. We’re competing with so many eyeballs. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Is that how you see yourself—as a newsfluencer? I’m a journalist first, but there are people who fall under that category. Influencers aren’t a bad thing, necessarily. I know there’s a lot of debate around it. But there are people who have leaned into the news as part of their brand and what they do. People thought that’s what I was. I actually found out that a lot of people didn’t even know that I was a journalist until relatively recently. They thought I was, and this is a quote, “Some dude sharing news stories online.” For the longest time I thought you were a bot. A lot of people thought I was a bot. Or that I was just scheduling posts. And now I feel I can’t change my profile picture. People might think I got hacked. Is the attention economy so fucked now beyond the point of saving that it’s impossible to break through the chatter in a meaningful way? When you think about it, we’re competing with Instagram aggregators, blogs, social media pages focused solely on news, podcasts—it’s all over the place. I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing. If it wasn’t for social media, I would not have been able to take the path I did. We are in a crisis of attention, but what I find more frightening is the rise of misinformation and disinformation. That’s more chilling to me than the amount of people who want to do the best work that they can, whether that’s on YouTube or TikTok. There’s more than enough happening out there for us all to get a piece or whatever. True. I’m more concerned about the bad actors who are going after people who may not be reading the link. They might just be reading the headline, right? They might just be looking at the post with the black font that says, hey, this is what's happening on Instagram, and that’s it. Because the state of news media has gotten so splintered, is this why you do what you do? I want to be able to be a resource for people online as far as getting them the information that they need. I mean, I love when people come up to me and they’re like, “Hey, you know, I found out about this through you.” I love hearing that because I do think there's so much out there that there’s an equal amount of things that are being missed or underreported or that maybe people aren’t paying attention to. The reach you have is pretty incredible. What I like most about whenever I’m sharing a story, I know that it’s not just readers who are at work who, you know, just opened up their phone and were like, “Oh wow, I found out about this story.” It's also assignment editors who follow me. People at The New York Times, at CNN— —at BuzzFeed. I bet they regret rejecting you now [laughs]. It’s funny because people will tell me, “Hey, we shared your tweet in our newsroom Slack channel. That’s how we found out about the story, and now we’re going to write about it.” So you don’t have to have millions of followers, but I have a reach that’s a little different. And that’s important to me. “We are in a crisis of attention, but what I find more frightening is the rise of misinformation and disinformation.” It should be. That’s not to say I always get everything right. I always tell people, journalists get things wrong. We issue corrections. We try our best to do what we can. But what’s most important to me is making sure that the stories that I think people need to know about or need to read about, I try to get them out there—and apparently my Twitter page is the best way to do it. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams There is a reason people call you the Anderson Cooper of Black Twitter. There are too many nicknames. There was a Twitter thread with a bunch of different nicknames. It’s humbling. It’s nice to see that people care about what you’re doing. But it also reminds me of how important it is—especially for our community, the Black community—to get these stories out and to make sure our stories are told and represented, and that people know about them. And not just get them out, but get them out correctly. Exactly. This week the Pew Research Center released a study stating that many Black Americans are distrustful of US institutions because they believe they are being conspired against. The same is true of news media. But a lot of people online trust you as a news source, which feels increasingly rare these days. And you know what, they’re not wrong [laughs]. I’ve been reading about media reparations. In the 1960s, the Kansas City Star totally ignored what was going on with the Civil Rights Movement and other things that were happening in the Black community. So they relied on Black newsrooms, the Kansas City Sun being one of them, to get them the news that they cared about. Obviously when we’re talking about news deserts, Black communities are completely parched. What’s the quote? When white America gets a cold, Black Americans get the flu. That’s doubly true for Black media and Black newsrooms. Whenever I look at layoff numbers, these giant losses that have happened in traditional and local media, Black newsrooms are disappearing at greater rates to their white counterparts. Sometimes I feel like the state of the industry is like trying to solve a riddle that can’t be solved, or doesn’t want to be solved—because, let’s be real, that’s a different discussion in itself. How can Black people better trust the news when we aren’t being staffed, or saved from layoffs, in newsrooms? Right. It creates a fractured news economy where instead of going to MSNBC or The Washington Post for information, people start to source their news from social media accounts that don’t always paint the full picture or even an accurate one. It is getting harder and harder. But I do know a lot of people who rely on accounts like The Shade Room or The Spiritual World for news. A friend recently sent me a news clip from TSW. I had never heard of it until then. And that’s just it! These platforms reach people that HuffPost would never ever be able to reach. They reach people that WIRED would never be able to reach. Never. So when you think about it from a media strategy, especially if you work in public relations, to me this makes sense because you want to get your story out to as many people as possible. I know that The Shade Room has put money into reporting. They want to do things outside of just clipping videos. They are trying to hire editors. The important thing is to try to meet people where they are at. That’s what I try to do. Gen Z and younger millennials—they're online and they’re on TikTok, they’re on Instagram, they’re right where these social media pages are. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams What’s your temperature on the state of Black media today? I’m under no illusion that it’s not rough. It’s definitely rough. What I would like to see are Black-owned, worker-owned outlets in the same vein as Hellgate and Defector. We haven’t really gotten into that space yet. That’s still a very, very white space. I think they would admit that too. They are doing some great work, and I wonder what that would look like for us. Is that what the future of news looks like? I think a piece of it looks like that. Journalism isn’t going anywhere. I know people say journalism is dying, but people will always want to know what’s going on. The industry’s been dying ever since I started out over a decade ago. People say that, but it’s just evolving. Your mileage may vary on how you feel about it. It’s always changing. It looks different today than it did yesterday. People seem more interested in brands and people now, and they might not be watching network TV as much, but they are on TikTok way more. Or maybe they are getting all their news from Instagram. It’s evolving in different ways. But yeah, what we are seeing now is just a piece of it, I think. And it’ll keep changing. What’s the hardest part about your job? [Long pause] The pressure of it. If you get something wrong when there are a lot of people relying on you— Four-hundred thousand people. But it’s actually more than that because of the way news spreads. I end up on the For You page a lot—and unfortunately with a lot of other, right-wing, big engagement folk. I think Twitter looks at me as a power user. I’m not afraid of being wrong or getting something wrong, because that comes with the job, but there’s still pressure. The thing is, if I share a story and it’s totally wrong, it doesn’t matter that I didn’t write it, people are gonna be like, OK, well, you shared it, right? It’s probably good that you don’t check your mentions, then. Oh, yeah, I don’t check my mentions a lot, because it’s mostly people fighting all day. But that’s just the nature of the beast now."
76,Jason Parham,AI Killed Images. Legacy Russell Knows How We Can Revive Them,https://www.wired.com/story/dial-up-legacy-russell-black-meme/,"The author of ""Black Meme"" has ideas for how to protect digital culture from the rise of generative AI. It starts with embracing slow media.",2024-06-07T15:23:01Z,"Jason Parham Within the frame of a single image lives a lifetime of experience, emotion, and affect. Photographs trap drama and performance. TikTok videos delight us with humor and consequence. For Legacy Russell, author of the new book Black Meme: A History of the Images That Make Us, virality may be the best indicator into how an image speaks. In deciphering the speed and movement of a given image, the way it courses through different contexts and communal spaces, its architecture of being becomes all the more manifest. Russell tells me that “asking questions about the truth of images, consent, and how we are complicit in the way they move—these are all things that are critical to this core driver of representation, and what the implications might be.” Those implications, of course, are all around us and only growing in intensity with the spread of generative AI (during a crucial election year, no less). Already we are witnessing a “decay of imagery,” she says, a degradation of what is accurate and authentic. To learn more, I phoned Russell, a New York City–based curator and author (her first book, Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto, was published in 2020), hoping to better grasp how images move through our world today, particularly across the internet, as they assume novel digital forms and sometimes strange meanings—or a lack thereof. Jason Parham: In the book, you call the Black meme both trap and trope—why? Legacy Russell: The frame of memetic culture or viral culture is oftentimes seen as its own economy. Often within that, there is the expectation that if something goes viral, or if meme material travels from place to place, there is something within that that is a positive. It is about a kind of recognition of a value set and a material having meaning to a broader public. This is why the book centers on moments that are not specifically tied to the internet, but predate the internet as we know it now. Yes—predate and predict. The trap is that in the acceleration of images there actually is not an assumed economy that allows for folks to engage questions of authorship or provenance in a way that has a robust infrastructure to support Black thought and Black cultural production. In fact, many things that are traveling through viral material can be turned on their ear within a model of dispossession, economically or otherwise. This is where trap and trope have their own relationship. Speaking to those pre-internet moments, you suggest that Black memetic culture would not exist without the gruesome history of lynching photography. How did those spectacles inform our relationship to memes today? When you asked, what’s an early meme I remember, for me coming into awareness of lynching postcards was that nascent memory. The very idea that this was something that could exist as a material. They exist now as archival material but also as a fungible economy; these are items that are considered American collectibles. Folks buy them online. But this is how we better understand the infrastructure of images and text. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams In what way? If memes are intended to circulate across boundaries and through different publics and intimacies, lynching postcards were among the first memes. Lynching postcards traveled across state lines. They literally were a form of terrorism in how they allowed there to be documentation of a violent act that was sanctioned by a white public. And celebrated. As well as preserved as a souvenir. Think of a collector who is writing a postcard to a loved one from a position of endearment, and on the other side of this correspondence, they are sharing an image of someone being brutally murdered. We should be asking about similar models of engagement and complicity that are enacted in this moment now when we are looking at things via our screen, exchanging materials of violence against Black people. The question, really, is how that is sustained by a broader public as part of the economy of the internet. Because of the rate at which Black images move on the internet, so swiftly robbed of all context, is there a way to reclaim ownership over them? Part of the interest in writing Black Meme, and having it exist as a physical [book] away from our screens, was the idea of creating slow media. So the slow media that has then intersected with the accelerated media of now—cyberspace and digital space—is very critical because part of this discussion is about a mitigation of speed. What happens when things are circulated and compressed in a mass acceleration, when many things are being perceived as copies of copies? Images are degrading over time. Often we are not seeing them for what they are. We’re seeing them as a contour instead of actually better understanding and situating the truth that lives inside that transmission. What I am proposing is a need to engage a different model of thought around the transmission of Black culture, as well as Black people and their representation through and beyond our screens. The inverse of slow media is our current reality. We are bombarded with media at all times. The velocity is constant and unpredictable. What is the danger in how social media, specifically digital spaces like Instagram or TikTok, has shaped our understanding of how memes live or die? It’s important to ask questions about the sustainability of the Black meme. Sustainability, yes. Vine in particular was a place where a lot of Black people were creating space and community, as well as engaging performative action. I call it performative action because it came in different forms of sonic engagement, movement, and models of gesture. The very idea of Vine was essentially a site where Black people were putting this to good use, and then it reached a point where it couldn’t sustain itself any longer, and thereafter was the rise of Instagram. Now TikTok is part of that broader equation, that brief and furious history. Platforms like TikTok are increasingly under scrutiny because they are being used as sites of organizing and exchange for and by people of color across many different diasporas. As the economies shift around that space, certain platforms fail to exist or collapse altogether, the question becomes, who is that impacting? Generative AI seeks to automate every part of our lives. In Black Meme, you call for royalties and reparations around those issues. What does this mean for the images that we will increasingly encounter, specifically within the Black visual medium? Are they under threat or is a new window opening? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams That’s a big question. It might be useful to complicate rather than simplify. Ok. As we’ve seen with early histories of digital automation, there have been many think pieces written around the feminization of automated labor, and what that looks like. Be that the feminized frame of Alexa or Siri. Aspects of these technologies exist within the gender and class economy, and also the race economy, although that’s spoken about less frequently. There has always been an imprint that is gendered inside of technologies as a means of making them familiar to us. How do you see that coming to the fore with the current uses of AI? When we ask what does it mean when there are AI resurrections or imitations of popular songs or performances across different media or artworks, part of the risk really is about the replacement of certain models of labor and what impact that has on a broader economy in the world. Right. AI can mimic almost any famous musician or artist now. It also encourages us to think differently about digital Blackface. AI is allowing for a different chapter of that to unfold at an accelerated rate. It also allows for people to consider differently about how they present different types of truths and/or fictions in the performance of race as it is resurrected in the world. Which can get ugly real quick, as we’ve already seen with so many grotesque depictions online. This is core to what you’re asking. Some of the defense around cultural production in relation to Black people has always been that there are people behind that work. We think about the economy as reparations or royalties and ways in which aspects of these things can be mitigated. At this moment now, there is a wide proliferation of people testing out different approaches to labor overall. Think of the Black people who are inside of AI in advertising, in reportage, even in thinking about a broader cultural discourse and visual representation of Black people in general stock imagery. It’s important to ask questions about the sustainability of the Black meme. Absolutely. So when we think about what is sellable, there are calls for an equitable form of representation that accurately intersects with an ongoing blending of the world, where more and more people of the diaspora are situated at the center of how media moves. While at the same time, some of the core forces in the economy that are rising up to extract from that are very aware that the representation of Black people can be done and engineered by AI. In the years ahead, if equity is too much of a risk, or is too expensive, Black people will be taken out of the equation altogether. We are already seeing that. What does it mean if AI does that work? Which essentially is to create ideas of human beings that do not exist but that can sell products, and can advance certain ideological agendas, but can also perform labor without breaking a sweat, needing a break, or requiring compensation, and in fact having that be something that can create economies for non-Black creators in ways that are perhaps even unknown to us in this very moment. That right now is the conversation. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Which will only get more tangled as AI advances. The discourse around reparations will complicate things further because it will be not purely about how the human has been situated in the middle and dispossessed, but rather how the human is set apart, marginalized, and cut out of the equation altogether with a different model that can form this work. And what does the compensation framework look like there when in fact it is, as I noted prior, a kind of copy of a copy? When Blackness itself becomes its own performance-based material and that itself is its own engine. Did you see the “All Eyes on Rafah” AI image that went viral on Instagram? I did. The use of AI to bend reality or to narrate outward fictions altogether can be corrosive to our understanding of what is or is not true or real. How this is applied can be a glitch or strategy in a broader system—in this particular case, using an AI image to subvert algorithmic censorship to elevate a discourse around ongoing violence that requires global attention is a double-edged sword. While on the one hand it may broaden a consciousness, on the other it aestheticizes a struggle for liberation and makes for quippy viral material to be exchanged. I do think some people had genuine intentions, but it mostly read as performative empathy. The image itself establishes a reality that lives far from the reality of what is happening on the ground. A reality many people blindly and happily live in. Its use is complicated. The AI image conceals the mechanics of violence and oppression as they are occurring in real time while at the same time seeking to advance awareness of a human rights emergency. This is an example of how material can be used toward and against its own mission. An example of how images, as they live “inside” of other images, can be part of the strategy of shaping ineffective attention economies, which fuel fantasies of hegemony but don’t always honor the real lives of the people living “inside” the idea behind the image itself."
77,Adrienne So,"5 Best Kids' Bikes (2024): Balance, Pedal, Coaster",https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kids-bikes/,The WIRED Gear team has tested all types of kids' bikes. Here are our top picks.,2024-06-09T13:30:00Z,"Adrienne So Most people think I bike with my kids because I like exercise or because I want to combat climate change. Neither is true (or, the entire answer, at any rate). No, it's just that sitting in pickup or dropoff lines in a car makes me want to yeet myself straight into the path of an oncoming 18-wheeler. Now that my kids are 7 and 9, and old enough to bike with me, it's also much more fun to watch them hop curbs and swing their legs and shout, “We live in a jungle!” than it is, again, to wait for traffic lights to change. The WIRED Gear team has many children, and we enlisted many of them to test these kids’ bikes on rides to school, on the trails, or around the park. These are our top picks for every age and size. Don't see a bike for your kid here? Let us know, as we will continue to test and update these picks. And if you're looking for a bike for yourself, check out our Best Electric Bikes, Best Cheap Ebikes, and Best Electric Cargo Bikes for Families guides. Special offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day. Bikes are expensive. It's tempting to future-proof your purchase by buying a bike a size or two bigger, for your child to grow into. Do not fall into this trap! Not only is it uncomfortable, it's unsafe—how would you expect to control a bike that was two sizes too big for you? To find the correct size, you'll either have to measure your kid's height or their minimum inseam length. Children's bikes are measured by wheel size, so a 12-inch bike refers to a bike with 12-inch wheels, and so forth. When you get the bike, see if your child can stand over the frame with flat feet comfortably on the ground. Make sure your child can get on and off easily and that their hands can reach the brakes and shifters if the bike has them. Other factors you might want to consider: Brakes: Most kids start with coaster brakes, also known as pedal brakes. They let you stop by pedaling backward. An older kid might want hand brakes so they can pedal backward like Mom or Dad. Rim brakes are cheaper, but a disc brake will help them stop faster. Shifters: Once your child is big enough to comprehend basic physics, an intuitive twist shifter will help them keep up with Mom or an older sibling. I can always hear my 7-year-old's shifter frantically clicking behind me and his sister on our way to school. Suspension: Are you planning on dragging your kid mountain biking with you? Then you might be considering a bike with shocks. However, these will add considerable weight and expense to the bike. Kids are also usually light enough so suspension might not work. I would suggest prioritizing bigger wheels and better brakes first. While I think around $400 is a reasonable price for a brand-new kids' bike, that's a lot of money. Do not get the cheapest brand-new bike at the big box store; I have done this before and ended up carrying tiny bikes to the nearest shop for replacement parts. There is a healthy secondary market for kids' bikes that children have outgrown. You might want to check Craigslist, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or ask your neighbors. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED As a trained volunteer at my children's elementary school, I have taught multiple (multiple!) children how to ride bikes, and the first step is simple. First, start with a balance bike, or a bike without pedals. Once they can push themselves off with feet on the ground, encourage them to balance and coast by jumping with two feet off the ground. (I suggest you do this by chasing after them and shouting, “Jump! Jump like a bunny! Jump!”) We have long since given this strider bike away, but this was my daughter's, and then my son's, first balance bike. It has a sturdy steel frame and grippy grips for slippery little paws. It can fit an inseam of 12 to 20 inches. The weight capacity as stated is 60 pounds, but a 165-pound dad may or may not have sat on this and wheeled around, and it was fine. We never did get around to doing this, but you can also add a foot brake so your child can stop if you push them down a steep hill. Ages 18 months to 5 years If you can afford it, Woom is my favorite bike brand for children. You can start with a 12-inch Woom balance bike and upgrade to bigger models from there, all the way up to the Woom 6, which is a 26-inch bike. At 5, my son sized into the 20-inch Woom 4, which is when children should start learning how to shift. The standout feature on the Woom 4 is MicroShift, which is an intuitive twist shifter to cycle between seven gears. My son shifts so rapidly on his way to school that it sounds like he's calculating on an abacus, but in a year of riding, the chain has never fallen off the gears or gotten stuck. That's amazing. Something to note is that Woom's sizing might be a little optimistic; my now 6-year-old son sized into a Woom 4 when he was 5, and the ergonomic grips were just a little too big for his hands. However, it's also a few pounds lighter than the Guardian (see below), which made it an easier bike to learn how to ride a two-wheeler. The Schwalbe tires are also nicer (and should be, for this price). The Woom 4 starts for kids who are 45 inches tall (3.75 feet), and Woom also provides a bike sizer tool. Ages 6 to 8 years The big problem with most little bikes is that they don't mirror the geometry of their grown-up peers. Kids' bikes tend to err on the side of being stable, at the expense of providing efficiency. This is why my then 7-year-old daughter's first ride on the ByK E-450 was such a revelation for her. Rather than having to walk a super-heavy kids' bike up the steep hill to our house, she was able to stay seated and power right up it. The E-450 isn't steel; it's a lightweight alloy that leaves the entire 20-inch bike weighing just over 18 pounds. (This is close to half the weight of the 20-inch bikes at Target, which average about 30 pounds.) The shape and weight of this single-speed make this bike easy for early elementary school kids to pedal, but it's the thoughtful details I appreciated most. The saddle is big and comfortable, it comes with a bell, and it was easy to take off the front tire so I could fit it in the front seat of a sedan when it was time to hand it down to her cousin. Oh, and when it comes time to go back down that big hill, there is both a coaster brake and two hand brakes. —Martin Cizmar Ages 5 to 9 years My daughter rode the steel Guardian 20-inch from the time she was 5 to when she was 7. The standout feature is the brake system; there's no pedal brake. Instead, Guardian has a patented SureStop brake system. There's only one handbrake, and it always triggers the back brake before the front brake, so it's impossible to flip the bike. This means the cabling system is a little longer and more complex than on most bikes, and I did sometimes get the front wheel tangled up in the brake cable. But I gave it to a 20-year-old to see if he could flip it and he couldn't, so there's that. Like the ByK, the Guardian is lighter than a Target bike, although it's a steel frame, so it does weigh 20 pounds. Guardian also has kid-specific geometry, with small grips and a lower center of gravity. It's compatible with training wheels, which I did put on and take back off again. Of the many bikes I've tested, it's also one of the easiest to put together out of the box. This bike is reliable and has lasted for years. It fits kids who are 43 inches tall, and Guardian also provides an online RideSizer tool to make sure you order the right-sized bike. Ages 5 to 8 years The Priority Start fills the gap between children's bikes and adult bikes and has everything you could ask for on a bike for an upper-elementary-age kid. The geometry of the bike promotes effective pedaling, and at roughly 23 pounds, it's a lot lighter than most competitors. The Priority Start's best features though are its components, starting with the hassle-free Gates belt drive. Often found on commuter bikes and ebikes, this carbon band takes the place of a chain but won't rust over, crust up with dirt, or slip off. That belt drive connects to an internal hub gear with three speeds. This also helps avoid maintenance issues, though my 9-year-old daughter complains she'd like a few more speeds (it does seem like the lowest gear could stand to go a little lower). The Priority Start is great for kids starting to take on longer rides like commuting to school, occasions where its worry-free reliability is massively appreciated. My daughter has grown far more confident in her riding in the 8 months since she started on the Priority Start, which is the main thing you want from a bike bridging the gap between a traditional kids' 20-inch bike and a standard adult 26-incher. —Martin Cizmar Ages 7 to 13 Getting the bike is the first step. Here are a few bike accessories my children use every day. Little Nutty Helmet for $70: Both my children started in the Baby Nutty helmet and upgraded to the Little Nutty. They come in a bunch of fun designs (I suggest letting your child pick out a pattern for maximum stoke) and have MIPS, which stands for Multi-directional Impact Protection System; it's a technology that helps protect the brain against rotational forces in an accident. Giro Fixture II Helmet for $75: Now that she's older and riding a bit faster, my daughter has graduated into a Giro MIPS helmet. The vents are bigger and it's a little lighter. Kryptonite New-U Evolution Lite Mini Lock for $104: Next, your child needs a lock to keep their bike secure when they go to school or the library. This lock isn't distressingly heavy for little hands. My kids like keys, but if your kid loses the key, get a lock where you can set the code. Thousand Front Traveller Magnetic Bike Light for $35: Kid bike lights are different from adult bike lights; my 7-year-old is not biking 12 miles in the dark at 25 mph without me. I want bike lights that are affordable and easy to take off and stash in a pocket. This is my favorite light for my kids' bikes, but if the bad reviews scare you, we also like these. It's not worth buying a cheap kids bike! Unfortunately, we have to test that theory sometimes ourselves. Schwinn 12-Inch Duet for $110: This bike was not worth the money and effort I spent on it. It's harder to assemble out of the box than many adult bikes I've put together. The parts also aren't machined that precisely, so it felt wobbly to a 3-year-old and couldn't go fast. On several occasions, I had to carry it to the bike shop because a pedal crank or training wheel broke. Spare yourself and your kid the misery.

78,Henri Robbins,Keychron Q1 HE Review: Hall Effect Goes Mainstream,https://www.wired.com/review/keychron-q1-he/,Keychron’s new keyboard brings Hall effect switches one step closer to the mainstream.,2024-06-09T14:00:00Z,"Henri Robbins If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 9/10 Analog keyboards have been the “next big thing” for ages now in the world of mechanical keyboards. These have sensors inside that can much more precisely differentiate between a slight and full keypress. They’ve long promised to revolutionize gaming and typing, being faster, more customizable, and more reliable (supposedly). But they’ve never quite been compelling enough for most people to adopt: Why sacrifice a proven track record for something new and experimental? I think you can compare analog keyboards to electric vehicles. Sure, they’re better on paper in a variety of ways, but the entire infrastructure around us is designed for internal combustion engines, and we’re all used to the handling and performance characteristics of our gas guzzlers. Why make a change when it's hard to know if the benefits outweigh the risks? Keychron’s new Hall effect (HE) keyboard, the Q1 HE, makes it easier to understand why. Combining the high-tech customizability of a Hall effect switch with the advanced construction of a premium mechanical keyboard brings out the best of both worlds. Plus having reliable and easy-to-understand customization makes the system a lot easier to understand. Hall effect switches are a type of mechanical switch, similar to optical switches, which can have multiple different inputs across one keypress. While optical switches use a laser to identify inputs, an HE switch uses magnets to manipulate an electromagnetic field when a switch is pressed, which then returns different values at specific distances. While these switches are new for consumer keyboards, the technology has been around for a while. One of the earliest manufacturers of Hall effect switches was Honeywell, who made these switches for the now-legendary Space Cadet keyboard. This version of the switch is incredibly different from modern iterations though—the only real similarity is that they both utilize magnets to create inputs. The benefit of these multiple inputs is the ability to adjust the actuation point of your key switches—when the switch identifies that you have pressed a key. Moving the actuation point to the top of the keystroke can make typing more responsive while moving it toward the bottom can prevent accidental mis-inputs. To create a good middle ground, there are settings like “rapid-trigger” that allow multiple keypresses in a row without the switch needing to return to its resting position. The Q1 HE is Keychron’s first Hall effect keyboard. While a few from other manufacturers have made an impact on the industry already (the Wooting 60HE being the most prevalent), consumer-grade Hall effect switches are still something fairly new and experimental, and Keychron is one of the first major keyboard manufacturers to incorporate the technology. The Nebula Double Rail Magnetic switches, made by Gateron, are a proprietary design currently exclusive to the Q1 HE. With both factory lubing and a new slider design, I’m impressed by how smooth they are. However, this kind of smoothness should be expected from Hall effect switches; the magnet-based system means there’s no need for any physical contact to happen between the components of the switch. The contactless system also means these switches will last quite a while. While Gateron hasn’t released any information on the longevity of these specific switches, its KS-20 Hall effect switches are rated for more than 100 million actuations. The switches, which have a standard 60-gram bottom-out weight, feel great to type on. They are incredibly smooth, with hardly any lateral movement or stem wobble when typing. They also have consistent resistance across the entire keypress and feel natural no matter where the actuation point is adjusted to. If the standard 60-gram spring weight ends up not being for you, Keychron independently offers its Dawn and Aurora switches, which have 50- and 70-gram weights respectively, although these can’t be ordered as the Q1 HE’s default switches.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The typing feel is bolstered by the keyboard’s ergonomics. Between a set of sculpted PBT key caps (meaning they have a spherical indentation) and a standard 6-degree typing angle (around where most mechanical keyboards sit), I found typing enjoyable even for long periods, although I did have to adjust to the relatively tall case and key caps. You might want to use a wrist rest, though that can come with its own problems. My only issue with the switches is the softness of the bottom-out. Instead of feeling solid at the bottom of the keypress, these switches feel slightly dampened, similar to an MX Silent Red switch (although much less drastic). The softness is nice for long-term typing since it feels far more relaxed than a harsh bottom-out, but I feel like the switch loses some responsiveness. This softness is enhanced by the Q1 HE’s gasket mount system, where the plate, PCB, and switches are suspended in the case by foam gaskets to make typing softer and quieter. Because the internal assembly is held in place by foam strips, this allows a slight amount of bounce when typing, which feels better to type on and reduces fatigue. The typing sound is softer and deeper than most mechanical keyboards. The main keys have a nice, deep tone that sounds similar to a Topre keyboard or a more “thocky” tactile switch. This sound is likely dampened by the installed case and plate foam but is still fairly neutral because of the aluminum plate. While the stabilizers aren’t great, I found that typing on them for around a week caused the factory-applied lube to thoroughly work itself into them and eliminate most rattling. If this isn’t the case, it’s easy enough to lubricate the stabilizers on your own. You can customize this keyboard, but rather than downloading a software application on your PC, you can use Keychron’s in-browser “Launcher” system. It works flawlessly, allowing for seamless customization of the keyboard's lighting, keymaps, and typing adjustments for the HE switches. In the new HE Mode tab, there are options for adjustable actuation distances, multiple inputs for a single key, and even gamepad emulation using analog switches. While these customizations themselves are impressive, what blew me away was how intuitive and easy-to-use all of these features were. For the most part, you can get all of them working with just a few clicks. Keychron Q1 HE Rating: 9/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The main issue I’ve found so far is that if you set the actuation distance to be as short as possible, whatever key you press down will continually press until you press another. That’s a pretty big issue, technically speaking, but it can easily be avoided by just setting the actuation distance to 0.20 mm instead of 0.10 mm. The other downside of Keychron's Launcher system is that none of these changes can be made in wireless mode. This is a limitation shared by every QMK-based Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used, though. I was left wondering what a few of the features do—the Long-Press Switch and Curve tabs don't have any explanations at all within the app. Turns out, the Long Press function allows you to give any key the same functionality as a Caps Lock key, where tapping the key causes a constant input, and tapping a second time disables it. The most obvious use for this is for crouching and sprinting in shooting games, but I also found it to be useful for simple automated tasks like strip-mining in Minecraft when combined with other programmability. My favorite feature in Launcher is the “heatmap” setting for the LEDs, which slowly moves the color of a key from blue to red when repeatedly pressed within a short time frame. This is one of the countless things you can do with Keychron's RGB lighting, which I've found immensely customizable and easy to work with. The Q1 HE brings to light a larger issue with Hall effect keyboards: cross-compatibility. With traditional MX-style switches (Cherry, Gateron, Kailh, JWK, etc.), you can pretty much buy any switch and know that it will work with your keyboard. However, the same isn’t true for Hall effect switches. Wooting’s 60HE uses a Hall effect switch manufactured by Gateron, and the Q1 HE uses a Hall effect switch manufactured by Gateron, but these switches can’t be swapped between keyboards even though they are the same shape (a modified version of the MX switch footprint), and have almost-identical assemblies. According to Gateron, this is because these switches are designed to “[cooperate] with different software and hall sensors,” and are made to different manufacturer specifications. While I can understand that different design choices and goals can result in these changes, I feel like a lack of interoperability between components, especially from the same manufacturer, really undermines a lot of the advances the keyboard world has made over the past two decades. Where everything once converged into a massive network of customizable and compatible components bolstered by innovations like QMK, the Unified Daughterboard, and hot-swap sockets, I worry about a future where each keyboard manufacturer slowly diverges into a proprietary ecosystem, and customization between brands (and, as a result, repairability and longevity) almost entirely disappears. Keychron Q1 HE Rating: 9/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The good news is the Q1 HE's construction is incredibly robust, and it has the same easy accessibility as most of Keychron’s designs. The keyboard comes with extra rubber feet, extra screws for both the case and stabilizers, an Allen wrench, and a screwdriver. There are easily accessible hex screws on the back, and the internal construction can be quickly removed without any additional tools. Along with this, the key caps are fairly standard, which means new keysets won’t be hard to find. The inclusion of sound-dampening foam and the use of an aluminum plate from the factory are both welcome additions. I find that a stiffer aluminum plate, although more expensive than a softer PC or FR4 plate, will typically feel better to type on for most people. As for the foam, it can easily be removed, so its addition simply allows for more customization without having to buy extra components, and for a more office-friendly configuration straight out of the box. Keychron also offers a separate brass plate and sound-dampening foam for upgrades, but separate listings and small differences between these and the normal Q1 and Q1 Pro plates imply that the models aren’t compatible with one another despite sharing a name. These are all much more large-scale issues than an individual keyboard. The Q1 HE, on its own, is fantastic. I simply haven’t encountered another readily available keyboard that matches its levels of typing feel and sound, customization, and build quality. It's not for for everyone. The level of customization is overkill for most people, and the proprietary switches mean that this customization is almost entirely on the software side. Anyone who really likes testing out different switches, or wants a typing experience outside of the narrow window of 50- to 70-gram linear switches, will likely be disappointed by what they can and can’t customize. However, most people aren’t going to be changing their switches regularly. Instead, they’ll likely find one setup they like and stick with it for years—it’s what we all did back before there were hot-swap sockets and hundreds of switches available, and that was good enough, for the most part. Overall, I really like this keyboard. The Q1 HE does everything right on the user's end, especially if you’re looking for a quality keyboard straight out of the box. It has some practical flaws, but those don’t matter if you like the default typing experience. The keyboard feels good, sounds good, and has customization options that are unique, practical, and incredibly in-depth.

79,Paresh Dave,"As Google Targets Advertisers, It Could Learn a Lot From Bing",https://www.wired.com/story/as-google-ai-overview-targets-advertisers-it-could-learn-a-lot-from-bing/,Microsoft and Google are bringing ads to their AI search experiences. But users don’t always find it helpful.,2024-06-14T09:00:00Z,"Paresh Dave For years Paula Thompson, vice president of client strategy at the US digital ad agency Optimal, has been helping Plunge sell baths to soak in chilling water by buying ads on Google search and Microsoft Bing. The ads appear atop results for searches such as “ice bath” and invite users to “Buy our cold plunge today” or “Experience the cold plunge difference.” But as Microsoft put an AI spin on its search engine, the tub maker’s ads on Bing now invite users to “learn about the benefits of cold plunging” or “learn about the exclusive benefits of Plunge,” according to Thompson. They direct to informational material, not the purchase pages that were mainly pushed before. This new tactic is one of the first examples of how the debut over the past year of search chatbots such as Bing Copilot are affecting advertisers, whose decades of patronage have kept tools free for searchers. Last month, Google confirmed that it would join their ranks and soon test ads in its AI Overviews search feature—prompting anxious ad buyers to study up on what’s been happening with Copilot. There is a lot at stake: Google parent Alphabet generated $74 billion in profits last year, and Microsoft $83 billion, with significant (though unspecified) contributions from selling search ads. It’s not certain that the companies can continue balancing the demands of advertisers with the desires of users in the newer AI search features. Already, WIRED, one ad buyer, and users on social media have experienced irrelevant and potentially deceptive ads in Bing’s new technology. In WIRED’s limited testing, ads in Copilot have felt incoherent. A prompt about ice baths brought up ads for backpacks, not for Plunge or its rivals. A request for weight-loss tips returned ads for fat-freezing belts, which weren’t listed among the AI-synthesized suggestions. Others have reached similar conclusions, including a user who last year described on Reddit seeing ads for dietary supplements not mentioned in an Copilot answer about burnout at work. Kya Sainsbury-Carter, corporate vice president of Microsoft Advertising, told WIRED in an interview that ads “are meant to be highly relevant, and so that's probably something we want to take a look at.” But James Murray, senior product marketing manager for advertising, later added in an email that seeing ads for products not mentioned in a Copilot response is normal. Traditionally, searchers receive ads based on the keywords they enter into the search bar. Copilot ads are driven not only by search terms, Murray says. They also could be tied to questions a user asked earlier in a conversation with the chatbot, prompts that Microsoft auto-generates behind the scenes to engineer a better answer from Copilot, and the AI-generated response itself. While the ads are always meant to be relevant, serendipity is part of Microsoft’s aim. Someone may search for “best ultra-HD, 8K QLED 80-inch TV,” but to help them explore a range of options, Microsoft will show ads for a TV that is 85 inches or has an OLED screen. “Even when users ask for something extremely specific, they still often click on ads for something that they didn’t ask for,” Murray says. (Google’s ads are meant to be relevant to the query and the AI response.) By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Disclosure of ads has been an issue on Copilot as well. Though Microsoft says it labels all ads, Marcus Pratt, senior vice president for insights and technology at the ad-buying agency Mediasmith, says he’s encountered at least two searches in which links with indications that they are sponsored arguably haven’t been adequately disclosed. Last week, Pratt looked up the best reels to wind up and store his garden hose. Copilot recommended eight options, all apparently lifted from an article from the reviews publication Spruce, which links to Amazon product listings and gets a commission when readers make a purchase. When clicking on the reels in Copilot, he ended up on giraffetools.com, with code in the URL suggesting it had been a sponsored link. But an “Ad” label is only visible if a user hovers over the link for a moment before clicking. Spruce and Giraffe Tools didn’t respond to requests for comment. In the other search, Copilot recommended a Nike Pegasus running shoe, but when hovering over the name, Microsoft showed a link to the shoe brand On with a small “Ad” label in the corner. A link to a Women’s Health article with more details about the Nike pair is below the ad. Pratt calls it a potentially dissatisfying experience for brands and a confusing one for consumers. “This blending of organic recommendations and sponsored listings is blurring the lines more than I have seen in the past,” he says. Nike, On, and Women’s Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. Microsoft’s Sainsbury-Carter says ad experiences may vary as Microsoft continues testing and applying feedback. Despite optimism among investors in the tech giants’ abilities to smooth out the rough edges and keep sales flowing, mixing AI-generated content into search is the industry’s biggest shift since the advent of smartphones. Google is trying to quickly satisfy people’s curiosity by using AI Overviews’ generative AI to summarize the web, which users have panned for embarrassing gaffes like suggesting they squeeze glue on pizza. Microsoft is not only publishing similar AI summaries, but also enabling users to explore topics by conversing with Copilot, the AI chatbot from Bing. Though Google has tested ads in a precursor to AI Overviews, Microsoft is so far ahead—displaying more ads and disclosing more about how they are doing. In a webinar for select ad agencies last week seen by WIRED, Microsoft’s Murray said that users click on ads in Copilot at nearly twice the rate they do for equivalent ads when they’re shown as the first ad above traditional search results, which historically is the most clicked ad. They also prefer a Copilot experience with ads than without by a slim margin. Sainsbury-Carter says to her, the data mean users are finding Copilot ads more integral than tacky. She adds that clicks on multimedia ads, specifically, were three times higher in Copilot than elsewhere in Bing between last July and this past January. The company declined to share specific figures but described the measure as statistically significant. Advertisers don’t have much choice about investing in AI search. Microsoft and Google are pulling from customers’ existing ad campaigns for other environments to fill the ad slots in Copilot and Overviews until more data is gathered on their effectiveness. That means Copilot can draw on advertisers’ content to show ads as simple text, a row of product images, sponsored links embedded within AI summarization, or multimedia widgets for booking travel or deciding which car to buy. “We're still in a place where we don't feel like asking advertisers to adopt, launch, manage, and optimize an entirely new campaign type,” Microsoft’s Sainsbury-Carter says. “Certainly that could happen over time if it feels like it's really bifurcating and the differences are great enough.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Fortunately for Microsoft, she says, advertiser requests to opt out of AI-focused ads and complaints about ads appearing beside inaccurate AI-generated copy have both been minimal. Microsoft is being “super measured” about how many ads are shown in the new features, Sainsbury-Carter says, declining to provide specific figures. Microsoft and Google also have not told advertisers exactly when their ads have appeared in AI features, limiting their ability to measure the payoff compared to traditional search ads. And the companies haven’t shared many tips on crafting ads for the new search features, according to four ad agencies’ executives, including Thompson. Sainsbury-Carter says the core message to advertisers is that optimizing for ads on Bing in general does the trick. Thompson, whose agency also represents Microsoft’s Azure Cloud business, has crafted her own theory about how to adapt: Instead of targeting people who search for a specific product, advertisers need to educate people who have never heard of the product in the first place, since it seems people often turn to Copilot with broad questions. Rather than targeting just short phrases like “cold plunge,” Plunge now tries to run Bing ads on longer queries such as “How to cold plunge,” “Where do I put cold plunge,” and “What is the optimal temperature for a cold plunge.” (As low as 37 degrees Fahrenheit, Thompson says.) Thompson believes that the strategy is helping because clicks are up on her clients’ Bing ads, though the search engine’s growth to 140 million daily users from 100 million a year ago also could be a factor. She gains additional comfort from Google’s statement at its big annual advertising conference last month that users find ads in the new experiences less gimmicky. But it’s hardly definitive. “I don’t think there’s enough transparency yet,” she says. There’s little doubt, though, that Microsoft views Copilot as essential to the feature of search. Heavy promotion and integration certainly contributed to the number of Bing searches that involved at least some use of Copilot growing four times faster over the past year than traditional searches alone, according to the company, which declined to share specific figures. Those using Copilot in some way during the second half of last year seemed to get to their answers quicker, shaving 12 percent off their searching time and increasing their ad clicks by 30 percent. That puts greater pressure on advertisers to perfect their messages and Microsoft’s algorithms to deliver them on the appropriate queries. About four out of every five ad clicks in Copilot during testing throughout last year came from chats lasting less than a minute, Sainsbury-Carter says. Advertisers and consumers had better get used to it, because ads are poised to spread to additional AI-heavy services. Snapchat, Chinese tech giant Baidu, and German newspaper Bild all signed up to use Microsoft technology to serve ads in their chatbots. Snap spokesperson Ahrim Nam says the partnership has graduated past the testing phase, but declines to further comment. Baidu declined to comment, and Bild didn’t respond to a request for comment. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Microsoft works with over 1,500 publishers, so ads could come to more chatbots as the trend of adding AI conversational tools to apps and websites grows. It will have some competition. OpenAds, a New York City startup that’s raised $1 million in funding, expects its ad technology to launch inside multiple AI search chatbots and image generators in the next couple of months, its CEO, Steven Liss, says. Liss took on the challenge of developing the service in part because Google, the dominant provider of ad technology on the web, currently refuses to serve ads on webpages and apps “where dynamic content (e.g., live chats, instant messaging, auto-refreshing comments, etc.) is the primary focus of the page.” Even if Google updates its policy, Liss says OpenAds can survive bigger players by designing more engaging ads. For now, Microsoft enjoys the rare advantage of being in the lead. But the contribution from Copilot and the other AI features to Microsoft’s $18 billion in annual ads sales is unclear, and Sainsbury-Carter declines to disclose the prices the new ads are fetching. “We think this can be a really interesting business over time, but we think it's an interesting business if we are surfacing personalized ads that people love and find joy from and that are super, super useful,” she says. It’ll also require them to keep plunging into the depths of trusting AI with their queries."
80,Eric Ravenscraft,Lux vs. Lumens and Explaining Other Lighting Gear Terms as You Shop (2024),https://www.wired.com/story/what-lumens-lux-and-other-lighting-gear-terms-mean/,Shopping for a video or photo light? Confused by all the jargon? Let’s simplify things a bit.,2024-06-13T14:00:00Z,"Eric Ravenscraft Planning your lighting for a photo or video shoot can be complicated, and the terminology used to measure light in lighting equipment can make things even more confusing. When shopping online, most lights list “lumens” or “lux” among their technical specs, though sometimes “lumens” is written as “luminous flux.” You might even get tripped up on luminance versus illuminance. It’s a lot. So let’s break it all down. One thing to note: You’ve probably seen light bulbs with output measured in watts; LED bulbs often say something like “60W equivalent.” However, watts are a measure of how much power a light bulb uses, not how much light it puts out. This metric is a holdover from when incandescent lights were commonplace and used significantly more energy than today’s LEDs. However, as more energy-efficient lights have grown in popularity, it’s no longer useful to use watts as a shorthand for how much light a bulb puts out (it wasn’t super useful to begin with). This is why you’ll see terms like lumens or lux on professional lighting gear. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. The first term you should get to know is lumens. The amount of visible light that a source puts out is referred to as luminous flux and the lumen is a unit of measurement for that raw output. You can think of this as how “distance” refers to how far apart two places are, while “kilometers” is the unit used to measure that distance. Lumens in the kilometers in that analogy. Stinson Carter Stinson Carter Julian Chokkattu This can be a little confusing because companies will list “luminous flux” without naming the unit of measurement. For example, one of our favorite lights for shooting professional videos, the Godox SL-60W, lists its luminous flux as 4,500 in its description. Using our metaphor above, this is like saying “Distance: 4,500” without listing what unit that number refers to. That said, while they’re not interchangeable, if you see “luminous flux” listed on a product spec sheet, it’s probably referring to lumens. However, this does make it important to double-check that you’re comparing comparable numbers when shopping for lights from different manufacturers. You might also see this metric as “luminance,” which is another, less common way to refer to a light source’s output. And, like “luminous flux,” it's a general term for the concept, not a unit of measurement. However, this is distinct from illuminance, which refers to reflected light, not the light coming directly from a source. And yes, it’s confusing. How much light a source puts out is only part of the story. After all, the sun puts out enough energy to melt … basically everything. Fortunately, the sun has a good sense of personal space and stays far enough away from the Earth to not destroy us all. For similar, less catastrophic reasons, factoring in how far away your light source sits affects the kind of light you’ll need. Lux is defined as one lumen per square meter, though the math can get tricky because we’re dealing with surface areas in three dimensions. Don’t worry, you don’t need to sweat it too much. Most professional lighting will simply list their output in lux (as well as lumens), and specify a distance. For example, the Aputure Amaran P60X is rated for 5,070 lux at 1 meter. This means a subject 1 meter from the light source will effectively perceive a little more than 5,000 lumens of light on them. If they’re farther away, less of the light from the source will hit them, and thus the subject will appear dimmer. This is helpful when shopping for a light because you might not need the brightest lights in the world. You only need to ensure the subject is the right distance away from the light source. Figuring out the right distance for a light source isn’t exactly intuitive, because of two major factors: The first is the inverse square law, one of those weird quirks of the universe that we have to deal with. Put very simply (mathematicians, please don’t yell at me), every time you double the distance between the subject and the light source, you quadruple how much light is needed to light them the same way. In other words, it means that every time you move twice as far away from a light source, only one-fourth of the light from that source will hit your subject. So, using the Amaran P60X above as an example, if it’s rated for 5,070 lux at 1 meter, then the subject will experience around 1,267 lux at 2 meters. Some lights will specify their lux at shorter distances, like 0.5 meters, which makes it crucial to make sure you’re comparing equivalent specs when looking at lights from different manufacturers. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The other major factor to consider is the light’s beam angle. Most professional lights will allow you to shape the light with accessories like reflector dishes. Light sources emit light in all directions, but you can reflect some of that light to point toward your subject, which can increase how much of the luminous flux lands where you want it to (and, in doing so, increase the lux on your subject). The beam angle measures the width of the cone of light coming from your light source. A wider beam angle means light is dispersed over more of an area. A narrower beam angle focuses light on a smaller area. Some lights will come with accessories to help you shape the light. You don’t always need the brightest light in the world—you just need to get the right amount of light onto your subject. That might mean more raw lumens, but it could also mean using reflectors, barn doors, or bounce boards to reflect the light you have to where it needs to go. The math might be a little intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, lighting a scene gets a lot easier. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

81,Amanda Hoover,LinkedIn’s AI Career Coaches Will See You Now,https://www.wired.com/story/linkedin-ai-features-career-coach-chatbot/,LinkedIn’s new generative AI features include chatbots based on popular career coaches and tools to rewrite résumés and cover letters.,2024-06-13T13:00:00Z,"Amanda Hoover Many burned-out workers have likely dreamed of hiring a career coach or résumé writer. Now, LinkedIn is introducing chats with generative AI career experts based on real people. Other new AI tools within the platform will help people write résumés and cover letters or evaluate their qualifications for jobs posted. LinkedIn has ramped up its generative AI tools in the past year and is moving to incorporate the tech into even more of its offerings. On Thursday, the career site announced new features like a pilot for AI-powered expert advice, an interactive chat to break down information in LinkedIn courses, and more AI features that can be used to search for and apply for jobs for its premium users in English. The changes showcase a massive push by LinkedIn to capitalize on generative AI. (LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, which has invested heavily in OpenAI, which in turn is powering the platform’s AI offerings.) And as LinkedIn continues its drive to become more than just a job site, people may spend their time there socializing or learning new skills through video courses. The idea behind some of these AI tools is both for people to grow their skills and to apply to more jobs that closely fit their experience, rather than blasting out résumés en masse. “We expect that you will find the most relevant job faster” using AI, says Gyanda Sachdeva, vice president of product at LinkedIn. LinkedIn’s AI chatbots will allow premium subscribers to ask career questions like, “How can I negotiate my salary?” The chatbots are trained on the coursework of real-life coaches, who are paid by LinkedIn to repackage their content. Among them are AI versions of Anil Gupta of the University of Maryland, psychologist and author Gemma Leigh Roberts, and career coach Lisa Gates. Last fall, LinkedIn added AI tools for recruiters to use conversational language to search for job candidates. And earlier this year, the company began rolling out generative AI tools that allow job seekers to open a chat window on job descriptions to ask if they might be a good fit for an open position. In turn, they receive AI-generated feedback about ways their skills and experience align well, or if there are other skills they should add to their profiles to stand out. LinkedIn is now enhancing some of these features. Premium users can begin their job search with a conversational inquiry, like “Find me an engineering job in Texas that pays at least $110,000.” They can then use generative AI to write cover letters and résumés, tailoring them to specific jobs, in addition to using it for messaging hiring managers or searching for work. WIRED tested the cover-letter-writing feature, and found that the tool was able to synthesize a reporter’s experience listed on LinkedIn and a job posting in a coherent way, but some more editing may be needed to really make the letter stand out with direct examples of past work. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The résumé and cover letter writing tools were highly requested by people who had been using other LinkedIn AI products, says Sachdeva. “Whenever you apply to a job, it's going to be a different résumé and a different cover letter. And the AI can help you do that.” AI tools are becoming more common in both the job hunt and on the hiring side. There are AI interviewers, as well as AI tools to sift through job applicants, and AI tools to help people bulk-apply for jobs. But there are signs that some of the tech can be biased, and little is known about what drives algorithms to make choices about who is hired. It’s still early to tell what impact LinkedIn’s new AI-driven features will have on the workforce at large. Rohan Rajiv, LinkedIn’s director of product management, said during an announcement of the new tools that AI can help recruiters to find “hidden gems,” or candidates that may not communicate in ways that have traditionally caught recruiters’ attention. But further building generative AI into job platforms like LinkedIn raises questions: Will AI help historically underrepresented job candidates enhance their profiles and applications to land jobs, or will it repeat past biases in hiring?"
82,Steven Levy,"No Matter How You Package It, Apple Intelligence Is AI",https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-apple-intelligence-is-ai/,"Apple is eager to show us that its approach to artificial intelligence is safer, better, and more useful than the competition. Maybe that's just a hallucination, but it's working.",2024-06-14T13:00:00Z,"Steven Levy While companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others had been upfront about their efforts in AI, for years Apple had been silent. Now, finally, its executives were talking. I got an advance look one day. Eager to shed the the impression that the most innovative of the tech giants was a laggard in this vital technology moment, its software leader Craig Federighi, services czar Eddie Cue, and top researchers argued that Apple had been a leader in AI for years but just didn’t make a big deal of it. Advanced machine learning was already deep in some of its products, and we could expect more, including advances in Siri. And since Apple valued data security more than competitors, its AI efforts would be distinguished by exacting privacy standards. How many people are working on AI at Apple, I asked. “A lot,” Federighi told me. Another executive emphasized that while AI could be transformative, Apple wanted nothing to do with the woo-woo aspects that excited some in the field, including the pursuit of superintelligence. “It’s a technique that will ultimately be a very Apple way of doing things,” said one executive. That conversation took place eight years ago, when the technology du jour was deep learning AI. But a year after that, a groundbreaking advance called Transformers led to a new wave of smart software called generative AI, which powered OpenAI’s groundbreaking ChatGPT. In an instant, people started judging tech companies by how aggressively they jumped on the trend. OpenAI’s rivals were quick to act. Apple, not so much. Many of its best AI scientists had been working on self-driving cars or its expensive mixed-reality Vision Pro headset. In the last year or so, Apple pulled its talent from such projects—no more autonomous cars—and instead came up with its own gen-AI strategy. And at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple revealed what it was up to. Uncharacteristically, for such an event, the news was less about products than Apple’s declaration that when it comes to gen AI, we’re on it. In an interview after the keynote, CEO Tim Cook explained the anomaly. “It became clear that people wanted to know our views of generative AI in particular,” he said. But just as in 2016, there was a cautionary note: While the company would now embrace generative AI, it would do it in a very Apple way. The company refused to even label its technology as artificial intelligence. Instead, it coined the phrase Apple Intelligence, a made-up technical name whose purpose seems to distance Apple from the scary aspects of this powerful tech wave. Apple isn’t interested in pursuing the singularity or making the movie Her come to life. It’s using this new tool to enhance productivity and creativity, and just as with past intimidating technologies, Apple-izing AI will make it go down easy. The approach is well timed. I date the age of generative AI from the November 2022 release of ChatGPT. We spent all of 2023 trying to absorb what it meant, and a lot of people are now experiencing a rejection impulse. They’re repelled by AI’s hallucinations and angry at the prospect of lost jobs. And most people still haven’t figured out what AI can actually do for them. In 2024, smart companies have been concentrating on how this jaw-dropping technology can actually be put to use in prosaic scenarios. Apple proclaimed, “AI for the rest of us.” (The one time the letters “AI” were used in the keynote.) It was a conscious invocation of the original Macintosh slogan. Presumably, Apple will spread AI to the masses in the same way it promulgated the graphical user interface with the Mac. In contrast to that great ambition, the products Apple touted during the keynote weren’t exactly revolutionary. A lot of the the demos involved summarizing, transcribing, auto-completing emails, organizing inboxes, writing paragraphs from prompts, and zapping photo-bombers from images. Those are table stakes for the gen-AI era. Apple’s pitch, as always, is that it will offer these advances organically woven into your normal workflow so you’ll actually use those features and be delighted by them. Apple has also come up with some nice twists in these products. Its Photos app promises a deeper search capability, using AI to figure out what a picture shows and who’s in it to search for specific images from vague prompts. In automatically generated email replies, Apple could ask you in certain cases a simple question, answerable by a single click—do you actually want to meet this person and when?—and then spin off a response that reflects your intent. More significantly, because users in Apple’s ecosystem have a wealth of personal information on their phones and computers, Apple’s AI can use that data to deliver relevant output while keeping those details onboard the devices, protecting users’ privacy. Apple SVP Federighi—still on the case—describes it as “intelligence that understands you.” (Apple even claims it will use outside investigators to verify that the data is indeed secure.) The most interesting of the Apple announcements involved its AI assistant, Siri, which has been looking like an antique in the age of generative AI. Apple promised that in the future—maybe 2025?—Siri would not only become a better conversationalist but also could be a uniquely powerful personal assistant by performing complex requests involving multiple apps. Ironically, this was the vision of the original Siri team in 2011, overruled by Steve Jobs in the pursuit of simplicity—and because the underlying technology just wasn’t ready. “This is the exact missing link from the original Siri,” says Dag Kittlaus, who was in charge of that team when Apple launched the product. Kittlaus and some key colleagues later attempted to fulfill the vision with a startup called Viv, which now lives on as a Samsung product called Bixby. In order for a complex system like this to work, it’s imperative to get a critical mass of developers to sign on. The WWDC program included sessions that instructed developers how to make their apps work with Siri. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Apple Intelligence might prove to be a disruptive and scary force no matter how benignly it’s packaged. If Apple does pull off its vision for Siri—something where a single command might allow a computer to knock off tasks that otherwise would take hours or days to complete—an avalanche of unintended consequences might ensue. Even knowing your preferences, how will Siri make its choices? Will it put you in a middle seat when it books a flight for you because it’s figured out you’re frugal–even though you’d gladly pay an extra $11 to sit on the aisle? When you ask it to catch up on headlines, will it cater to your biases? No matter what Apple calls it, AI is going to change the way we do things. At WWDC this week, Apple promised to be part of the transformation. In 2016 Apple picked me to reveal that, under the hood, its products were loaded with AI. In the age of generative AI, the company understood that it needed a more public declaration that it was now prioritizing the new technology. That was the theme of the 2024 WWDC. But a lot of the issues—privacy, control, and what goes into training sets—are the same as they were eight years ago. While it’s clear that machine learning has changed Apple’s products, what is not so clear is whether it is changing Apple itself. In a sense, the machine learning mindset seems at odds with the Apple ethos. Apple is a company that carefully controls the user experience, down to the sensors that measure swipes. Everything is pre-designed and precisely coded. But when engineers use machine learning, they must step back and let the software itself discover solutions. Can Apple adjust to the modern reality that machine learning systems can themselves have a hand in product design? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “It’s a source of a lot of internal debate,” says Federighi. “We are used to delivering a very well-thought-out, curated experience where we control all the dimensions of how the system is going to interact with the user. When you start training a system based on large data sets of human behavior, [the results that emerge] aren’t necessarily what an Apple designer specified. They are what emerged from the data.” Apple isn’t turning back, says [SVP Phil] Schiller. “While these techniques absolutely affect how you design something, at the end of the day we are using them because they enable us to deliver a higher quality product.” Fred asks, “Do you believe in life after apps?” Thanks, Fred. If I may parse your question, I intuit you are asking whether something lurks beyond the current paradigm of computing, where an operating system hosts a suite of applications where the actual working, playing, and socializing occur. If this did happen, it would be a seismic change in the digital world. But once again, the adherents of generative AI are offering an alternative. Instead of opening an app, you’d simply say what you want to a smart assistant and—poof!—it will be done. There’s a lot that would have to happen for that vision to materialize. The entire software infrastructure is now centered on an app-style economy. And AI is just not good enough to do everything as neatly as apps do. On the other hand, picture a successful execution of what Apple wants to do with Siri. You might give it a complicated list of things to accomplish on a shopping trip, and one thing might include getting from one place to another. Apple could access the inner workings of a car service like Uber or Lyft, and everything you do within that app could be done by Siri. You’d still be taking an Uber, but the app would disappear. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams For now though, there’s plenty of life in apps. Especially if they are powered by AI. You can submit questions to mail@wired.com. Write ASK LEVY in the subject line. Florida—the state that bans mentions of climate change in its laws—breaks more records in rainfall and flooding. Everything that Apple rolled out at WWDC. Ray Kurzweil isn’t surprised at what’s happening with generative AI; he predicted it years ago. He’s also saying that people can essentially live indefinitely. I plumb the implications of this in our interview.

83,Simon Hill,Smartphones May Affect Sleep—but Not Because of Blue Light,https://www.wired.com/story/blue-light-smartphone-screen-sleep/,New research has found that blue light from your smartphone screen won’t keep you up at night. But you still shouldn’t doomscroll in bed—here’s why.,2024-06-09T12:00:00Z,"Simon Hill You’ve likely heard that blue light from smartphone screens may be keeping you awake at night. While the sun is our main source of blue light, the rise of LEDs and screen use exposes us to artificial blue light in the evening. Blue light suppresses melatonin, a hormone we naturally produce to help us drop off at night. Therefore, blue light can make it harder to fall asleep. Right? Well, maybe not. The amount of blue light that smartphone screens emit is relatively tiny, and there is mounting evidence that claims about their impact on sleep are overblown. In a recent review of 11 studies from around the world, published in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews, as reported by the Times, researchers found no evidence that screen light in the hour before bed makes it tougher to drift off. “The evidence for smartphone use near bedtime affecting sleep and circadian rhythms isn’t great,” Stuart Peirson, a professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University, told WIRED via email. The oft-cited 2014 study from Harvard that kicked off the blue-light screen panic remains the best evidence for light-emitting devices affecting sleep. It found screen use before bed delayed the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. It’s not much, but any increase in sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) is unwelcome. Dig deeper, though, and you will find the people in the trial were asked to read for four hours before bedtime on an iPad at maximum screen brightness. “Sleep and circadian responses to light are dependent upon intensity (the brighter the light, the bigger the response),” says Peirson. While screens are getting brighter, they are still relatively weak compared to the sun. Even LED bulbs are much brighter than screens. If you are concerned about melatonin suppression, the evidence suggests electrical lighting in the home is more dangerous than screens. Some argue that screens are a bigger risk because we stare directly at them for hours, but modern smartphones have adaptive brightness to reduce the glare in darkened rooms. Few of us crank our screen brightness to maximum and leave it there. However, while the blue light from smartphone screens is unlikely to be bright enough to cause significant issues, that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to tuck up with a cozy smartphone at bedtime. “A much greater issue is likely to be the content viewed,” says Peirson. “Reading work emails relating to impending deadlines is clearly going to cause anxiety, and anxiety is strongly related to insomnia.” We also know that doomscrolling on social media can have negative effects, including less and poorer quality sleep. Getting too engrossed in anything on your phone makes it all too easy to stay up later than you should. Many people sleep with their phones within reach. Some even allow notifications and messages to disrupt their sleep. If you don’t silence your gadgets at night, they will likely disturb you. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Kids are more sensitive to blue light, so any potential impact could hit them harder, but another clue that blue light may not be the issue is the differing impact of interactive screen versus passive screen use. Chilling out in front of the TV, or even reading on your phone, is more relaxing than playing a video game or messaging in a group chat, even though blue light exposure is the same. Another issue with the way we use screens is that we tend to stare intently, blinking less frequently, which can cause our eyes to dry out. Whether you call it computer vision syndrome or digital eye strain, most of us have suffered from itchy or red eyes, blurred vision, headaches, or neck or back aches at some point, usually after working on a computer. Experts continue to recommend the ""20-20-20"" rule: Every 20 minutes, try to look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. A whole industry has sprung from concerns about blue-light exposure. You can buy blue light-blocking glasses, filters, and special light bulbs, not to mention software options, including dark modes. But do any of them actually help, or is this just more scaremongering designed to sell snake-oil tech? They may theoretically work, says Peirson, but the evidence is not straightforward. He highlighted this review, which suggests a positive influence on sleep latency for people with sleep disorders, jet lag, and variable shift work. But he says the problem with most studies is that the actual light exposure of the participants is not measured, and the wavelength that these filters block is often poorly described. Blue light has a shorter wavelength (between 400 and 495 nanometers) than red light (620 to 750 nanometers). But different filters block different wavelengths, making them tricky to compare. Peirson says cutting off longer wavelengths can be more effective at reducing light exposure to our circadian rhythm (our natural sleep/wake cycle), but can also impact visual function, making it harder to see. This Cochrane Library review examined several studies and found “no clinically meaningful difference” between normal lenses and blue-light filtering lenses. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the College of Optometrists in the UK say there is no evidence that blue light from screens is damaging our eyes, and neither recommends blue-light-blocking glasses. This study of blue-light filter applications suggests they don’t improve sleep either, and dark mode may not be as good for your eyes as you think. So what are we supposed to do? If you are concerned about getting a good night’s sleep, establishing a bedtime routine is crucial. The intervention with the strongest evidence base is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), according to sleep expert Sophie Bostock. She was part of the team that worked on Sleepio, which cured my insomnia. It’s a six-week course that combines various simple techniques: Bostock also says that if you get plenty of natural light during the day, your body clock will be less sensitive to the effects of light at night. A morning walk or coffee in the garden before you start work can help get your circadian clock on track. While blue light has the potential to harm us, it can also be good for us. One study exposed students to either artificial blue light or warm white light for an hour each morning and found that blue light didn’t just reduce melatonin levels; several students also reported higher alertness, positive mood, and visual comfort. As with most things in life, balance is key. Ultimately, you should avoid bright light before bed, but the blue light emitted from a dimmed smartphone screen or TV is not worth worrying about. That said, taking a break from screens at night is probably a good idea, especially for kids. Podcasts and audiobooks are a great way to unwind without screens. And if you must use your smartphone in bed, follow this achingly simple rule: Stick to fun stuff and avoid anything stressful."
84,Vittoria Elliott,AI Tools Are Secretly Training on Real Images of Children,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-tools-are-secretly-training-on-real-childrens-faces/,"A popular AI training dataset is “stealing and weaponizing” the faces of Brazilian children without their knowledge or consent, human rights activists claim.",2024-06-10T04:01:00Z,"By Vittoria Elliott Over 170 images and personal details of children from Brazil have been repurposed by an open-source dataset without their knowledge or consent, and used to train AI, claims a new report from Human Rights Watch released Monday. The images have been scraped from content posted as recently as 2023 and as far back as the mid-1990s, according to the report, long before any internet user might anticipate that their content might be used to train AI. Human Rights Watch claims that personal details and photos of these children were gathered by data repository Common Crawl and then URLs that linked to them were included in LAION-5B, a dataset that helps to train data for AI startups. “Their privacy is violated in the first instance when their photo is scraped and swept into these datasets. And then these AI tools are trained on this data and therefore can create realistic imagery of children,” says Hye Jung Han, children’s rights and technology researcher at Human Rights Watch and the researcher who found these images. “The technology is developed in such a way that any child who has any photo or video of themselves online is now at risk because any malicious actor could take that photo, and then use these tools to manipulate them however they want.” LAION-5B is based on Common Crawl—a repository of data that was created by scraping the web and made available to researchers—and has been used to train several AI models, including Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion image generation tool. Created by the German nonprofit organization LAION, the dataset is openly accessible and now includes links to more than 5.85 billion pairs of images and captions, according to its website. LAION says that it has taken down the links to the images flagged by Human Rights Watch. The images of children that researchers found came from mommy blogs and other personal, maternity, or parenting blogs, as well as stills from YouTube videos with small view counts, seemingly uploaded to be shared with family and friends. “Just looking at the context of where they were posted, they enjoyed an expectation and a measure of privacy,” Hye says. “Most of these images were not possible to find online through a reverse image search.” LAION spokesperson Nathan Tyler says the organization has already taken action. “LAION-5B were taken down in response to a Stanford report that found links in the dataset pointing to illegal content on the public web,” he says, adding that the organization is currently working with “Internet Watch Foundation, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, Stanford, and Human Rights Watch to remove all known references to illegal content.” YouTube’s terms of service do not allow scraping except under certain circumstances; these instances seem to run afoul of those policies. “We've been clear that the unauthorized scraping of YouTube content is a violation of our Terms of Service,” says YouTube spokesperson Jack Maon, “and we continue to take action against this type of abuse.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams In December, researchers at Stanford University found that AI training data collected by LAION-5B contained child sexual abuse material. The problem of explicit deepfakes is on the rise even among students in US schools, where they are being used to bully classmates, especially girls. Hye worries that, beyond using children’s photos to generate CSAM, that the database could reveal potentially sensitive information, such as locations or medical data. In 2022, a US-based artist found her own image in the LAION dataset, and realized it was from her private medical records. “Children should not have to live in fear that their photos might be stolen and weaponized against them,” says Hye. She worries that what she was able to find is just the beginning. It was a “tiny slice” of the data that her team was looking at, she says—less than .0001 percent of all the data in LAION-5B. She suspects it is likely that similar images may have found their way into the dataset from all over the world. Last year, a German ad campaign used an AI-generated deepfake to caution parents against posting photos of children online, warning that their children’s images could be used to bully them or create CSAM. But this does not address the issue of images that are already published, or are decades old but still in existence online. “Removing links from a LAION dataset does not remove this content from the web,” says Tyler. These images can still be found and used, even if it’s not through LAION. “This is a larger and very concerning issue, and as a nonprofit, volunteer organization, we will do our part to help.” Hye says that the responsibility to protect children and their parents from this type of abuse falls on governments and regulators. The Brazilian legislature is currently considering laws to regulate deepfake creation, and in the US, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has proposed the DEFIANCE Act, which would allow people to sue if they can prove a deepfake in their likeness had been made nonconsensually. “I think that children and their parents shouldn't be made to shoulder responsibility for protecting kids against a technology that's fundamentally impossible to protect against,” Hye says. “It's not their fault.” Updated: 6/10/2024, 5:20 pm EST: WIRED has clarified that LAION has removed links to the images, and to further explain that the images were initially gathered by data repository Common Crawl, which was then used to inform links that appeared in LAION-5B."

Michael Calore 7 days ago Michael Calore 7 days ago “Apple showed off Apple Intelligence across numerous apps. The technology can rewrite messages in Mail, generate new emojis on-demand, and summarize content in Safari. An AI refresh to Siri will make the assistant better able to handle complex spoken commands and better able to search for information even if a command is ambiguous.” Read the WIRED story: Will Knight on Apple Intelligence Michael Calore 7 days ago Thanks for joining us, everyone! We'll have a summary of all the big news from the WWDC keynote (not AI-generated, we swear) shortly, along with more analysis of Apple's announcements. We'll drop links to those stories here once they go up. 7 days ago This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Julian Chokkattu 7 days ago Craig said this very quickly but: “Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of our most advanced silicon, and will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later. We are bringing it to users in beta as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequioa this fall.”We'll probably get more details soon but it sounds like you have to upgrade your iPhone to use Apple Intelligence (either to the 15 Pro or the upcoming iPhone 16 series). Steven Levy 7 days ago Sorry that Sam himself didn't get in the Apple keynote video. Maybe Sora can generate a piece where he shakes hands with Tim of the roof of the Ring. Michael Calore 7 days ago Tim Cook takes us home. No parkour, sadly. Brenda Stolyar 7 days ago The keynote has come to an end! I'm hoping they'll let us have a bit of hands-on time with some of these new features later today. Michael Calore 7 days ago Developers will be able to add AI-assisted Siri capabilities to their apps using AI Intents. These capabilities can be added to apps within these categories. Julian Chokkattu 7 days ago Brenda, to me, I get the sense that they rushed through it because it feels like an admission that Apple's Intelligence is not quite intelligent enough. Michael Calore 7 days ago Interesting that the OS asks you if it's OK to hand the request off to ChatGPT, instead of just providing an answer right away. I'd assume Apple is doing this extra step for privacy reasons. Brenda Stolyar 7 days ago It feels weird that Apple is being so casual about the ChatGPT integration. I feel like it was hyped up so much only for the company to quickly move past it. Julian Chokkattu 7 days ago “We also plan to include support for other AI models in the future.”  Nena Farrell  7 days ago Siri can do anything–as long as it can ask ChatGPT. Julian Chokkattu 7 days ago Why do I feel like Siri is going to ask ChatGPT a lot. Will Knight 7 days ago Apple will let you use outside AI models including, yes, ChatGPT, which it is integrating into Siri. Brenda Stolyar 7 days ago You'll also soon be able to transcribe Voice Memo recordings. Last year, with iOS 17, Apple launched the ability to transcribe Voice Notes (which I love to use when I can't get around to listening to the audio). Michael Calore 7 days ago Apple's computer vision lets you search for specific things in photos. This is great.

86,Adrienne So,The Top New Features in WatchOS 11 (2024),https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watchos-watchos-11-top-new-features/,"Ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the Apple Watch, Apple is adding new health features like pregnancy tracking and a fitness training algorithm to watchOS 11.",2024-06-11T12:00:00Z,"Adrienne So At this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced small but significant updates to watchOS 11. This year is the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Apple Watch, and rumors abound that we will see a major redesign of Apple's wearable this fall, with a new suite of health features that may include blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection. This summer's update doesn't include that stuff, but it does include the new Vitals app, as well as a comprehensive algorithm called Training Load. These features, combined with new partnerships with the real-time glucose monitor Dexcom, make the watch a more comprehensive health monitoring device. The new capabilities come along with other upgrades, like a redesigned Photos face and updates to last year’s Smart Stack, which lets you scroll through your widgets more easily. Here, we break down the operating system’s top new features. And as always, don’t forget to check out our guides to the Best Smartwatches and the Best Fitness Trackers. WatchOS 11 is compatible with the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) and newer. However, you will need an iPhone XS or later that runs iOS 18. Not all the features listed here will be available on every watch. The developer beta is currently available to people enrolled in Apple's developer program. The public beta will be available soon as an optional free software update for users of the Watch Series 6 or newer. The final version of watchOS 11 will roll out this fall to everyone. Most of the top new features are listed here, but check out Apple’s guide for the full list. Heart rate, respiratory rate, skin temperature, and blood oxygen (well, maybe) are just a few of the important health features that the Apple Watch currently monitors. A new Vitals app in WatchOS 11 lets you quickly view those metrics at a glance in a tidy dashboard. The app also lets you know when those numbers drift out of a safe range, using real-world data derived from Apple’s Heart and Movement study. If your numbers drift too high or too low, Apple will send you a notification to check whether you’re sick, drank some wine last night, or doing something else unhealthy. One of those behaviors (ahem) may result in pregnancy, which is why Apple is also launching a new pregnancy feature in the Cycle Tracking section of the Health app. Cycle Tracking will now also let users record the gestational age of a fetus, as well as monitor other data points that can provide insight into a mother's health during a pregnancy, such as their heart rate. For the past several years, Apple has included more and more granular fitness features into its watch. These advanced features are intended to allow the Apple Watch to better compete with Garmin’s premium outdoor sports watches. One big hole in Apple’s feature list? A comprehensive algorithm, like Garmin’s Body Battery or Fitbit’s Daily Readiness, that helps wearers understand what to do with all that granular data. At WWDC, Apple announced Training Load, which measures how the intensity and duration of your workouts impact your fitness over time. Training Load takes into account calorimetric data like heart rate, pace, and elevation, plus personal data like age and weight. If you're doing a popular cardio workout while wearing your watch, the wearable can automatically generate a 1 to 10 effort rating score. Otherwise, you can input your own effort rating by choosing a number between 1 and 10. Apple then generates a 28-day Training Load score that will let you compare your past month of workouts to the past seven days to see if you’re improving for your next goal, whether that's a 5K or a marathon. You can also manually adjust this estimate to account for factors like soreness or illness. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano You can access Training Load in either the Vitals section on the Activity app on your watch or in the Fitness app on your iPhone. It’s also worth noting that Training Load is not an original concept that was invented by Apple; watches like those from Garmin and Coros already provide a training load score to let you know whether your performance is improving or decreasing. Apple’s activity rings, which Apple Watch users fill in over the course of each day by staying physically active, are one of the most popular and easy-to-use fitness features on the watch. Failing to close those rings each day can be a source of anxiety for many, and most Apple Watch users are devoted to closing them before bed, always and forever, in order to maintain their fitness streaks. (You could always tap on an unclosed ring and adjust your goals downward to fill it in, but that's cheating.) New in watchOS 11, you can pause your activity tracking to take a rest day, week, month, all without affecting your fitness streaks. (Just to note, this is a feature that's already on other trackers, like the Oura ring.) The Fitness+ app has also been redesigned to be more easily customizable and let you study some of the new fitness metrics in your iPhone. That includes a personalized For You space, Explore and Library spaces, and new awards. There are also even more workouts that use GPS, like soccer, football, and snowboarding. You can now make custom workouts for pool swims. If you play or practice an outdoor sport, like hiking or running, your family and friends might have gotten nervous every time you went out alone—especially at night. Now you can ease their worries with Check In, a new feature that debuted in iOS 17 that not only tells your loved ones when you arrive at a location, but also sends you safety prompts if you don’t arrive. You can now Check In directly within the Workout app on the Apple Watch or via the Messages app on your watch, the same way you would on your phone. Last year in watchOS 10, Apple introduced a feature called Smart Stack. Instead of trying to scroll through tiny apps to find the one you want, you could scroll through bigger widgets on the face of your watch within a Smart Stack. It's the “smart” part that made it more helpful: The most important widget was automatically brought to the front, depending on the time or your location. Now Smart Stack has added even more widgets, like Shazam and Photos, that can be shuffled through. New widgets are also interactive, and your Live Activities will also appear in your Smart Stack. The Translate app will show up in your Smart Stack too, so you can access translation for up to 20 different languages in the watch. The app also offers romanized spellings so you can pronounce words in languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano A redesigned Photos face also lets you use Apple’s machine learning capabilities to scroll through your Photos library to find your best photos, taking into account composition, aesthetics, and all sorts of other factors that you might not otherwise have known were quantifiable. The watch automatically positions the photo to create depth and drama, and you can personalize the layout of the watch face by choosing fonts and where to place the clock. There's also a dynamic setting that pulls up a new photo every time you raise your wrist to wake the watch face. Apple listed many smaller software updates coming to the watch—new ways to use Apple Pay, Apple Maps, and more—but the biggest announcements at WWDC centered on the new artificial intelligence capabilities being built into all of Apple's devices. However, very few of the hotly anticipated generative AI features will be making their way to the Apple Watch. The closest integration is summarized notifications, which will be forwarded to the watch from your phone via Apple Intelligence. And when I say “your phone,” I really mean a compatible iPhone; Apple's AI features will run on only the latest mobile hardware, so you'll get this watchOS 11 feature only if you have an iPhone 15 Pro, an iPhone 15 Pro Max, or one of the new iPhone models coming this fall."
87,Boone Ashworth,"Everything Apple Announced at WWDC 2024: AI Features, New Siri, Genmoji",https://www.wired.com/story/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/,"The company's annual developer event was stacked with demonstrations that showed off the new artificial intelligence capabilities coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs.",2024-06-10T20:32:35Z,"Boone Ashworth Apple typically uses its annual developer conference to announce big software updates and introduce new devices. But this year, Apple set aside the gadget talk and left plenty of room for what everyone expected would be the main topic of WWDC: all of the shiny new AI features coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Of course, Apple is arriving late to the artificial intelligence party, and has found itself in the position of needing to partner with a more established AI company to gain a foothold in the current arms race. In April, rumors emerged that Apple might be partnering with Google to utilize its Gemini AI on iPhones, but that doesn’t seem to have panned out. Instead, Apple is partnering with OpenAI for its first big batch of AI enhancements. Here’s everything Apple announced at WWDC. Most of these features will become available in the fall, when Apple typically updates the software that runs on each of its devices. Apple’s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, debuts Apple Intelligence. In Apple’s world, AI doesn’t stand for artificial intelligence. It stands for Apple Intelligence. In a series of prerecorded demos, Apple laid out a vision for how users will interact with these new AI features, keeping the focus on personalized tasks and underscoring the usefulness of the AI-assisted capabilities. Apple says it can use AI to provide a highly personalized experience for you, the iPhone user, because its system is able to collate all sorts of information the AI has learned about how you use your device. Apple’s AI can help with writing emails, reports, and personal text messages. The AI can also generate images inside Messages that are informed by the context of the conversation you’re having. If you and your friends are chatting about throwing a rooftop party, it can generate an image of what that party might look like. It can even generate AI images of the people you’re talking to. So if you’re texting your mom, the AI can sync with any photos you have identified as showing her face and then use those to generate an illustration of her. (If your mom is anything like mine, she will deeply hate this.) Apple Intelligence also has advanced writing tools that can generate full emails or messages, or review what you’ve written to change the tone of a work email to help you avoid saying something you might later regret. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The artificial intelligence tools will gain summarization features that can be used to give you the gist of a web article or catch you up if you’re dropping back into a particularly vocal group chat after some time away. Summarization is something the other big AI players have been doing for a while. In fact, Google’s AI overviews have caused a ruckus recently after its ability to summarize search results have been called out for being misleading—sometimes just outright wrong—and also have been demonstrated to siphon content from original creators. Apple was also eager to point out that many of these AI capabilities are processed privately on the device itself, and that, only when necessary, it can use secure cloud-based AI processing to complete your requests. ChatGPT integration. Additionally, there are new capabilities being added to iOS that come courtesy of Apple’s partnership with OpenAI. The most visible is that some Siri requests and generative text requests can be handed off to ChatGPT—powered by GPT-4o, Apple says—to complete them. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was even spotted at the Apple campus today, though he didn’t appear in Apple’s promo video. Read all about this new partnership in Will Knight’s WIRED story. Apple Intelligence requires phones with the A17 chip or devices with at least M1 chips. That means it can run on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the new iPhones coming out this fall, or any iPad or Mac with an M1 chip or later. New Siri. Siri, Apple’s longtime digital assistant that no one really likes, is getting an AI glow-up. Apple says Siri is now smarter and better able to determine intent and decipher more complicated information. You can ask it several questions in a row, and it’s smart enough to understand that the questions are related to one another—something known in the AI world as contextual awareness. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano It can complete more tasks than before, making it more helpful than it was in the old “alarm-setting” era. The more powerful Siri experience will be incorporated into Apple’s core apps, and developers will be able to add the new Siri’s capabilities to their own apps. You can type out requests to the new Siri, like asking it to set an alarm late at night without waking the person sleeping next to you. (Reminder: Google Assistant has been doing this for a while.) Finally, Siri has a new look: a new infinity-symbol-like logo, and a new status alert that makes a colorful ring appear around your entire phone’s screen when the assistant is listening to your request or generating a response. The new Photos app coming in iOS 18. The Photos app will get some additional editing features that will let you do things like make more elaborate enhancements to existing photos and remove unwanted people or things from the frame. (These are all abilities that have already been in Pixel and Samsung phones.) Clean up the beach. Apple is also making photo organization cleaner. Its new Apple Intelligence features will enable it to better recognize people in your contacts and group them together so you can find photos easier. With Apple Intelligence, you can also search for photos with more natural search terms, like “pics of Gina riding a skateboard on the park bench.” Genmoji in action. Apple is using its newfound AI capabilities to create custom emoji on the fly. The new Genmoji lets you enter prompts to generate new emoji characters that match the mood of the message you’re writing. You can mix up classic emoji, or generate something new that’s more specific to your needs. Want an eggplant riding a cheeseburger? You can probably cook that up. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano And yeah, it’s called Genmoji. It’s OK to laugh at it! Make your home screen look however you want. Many of the changes coming to iOS when an update arrives this fall have nothing to do with AI. The key theme at WWDC was “enhanced customizability,” and Apple showed off ways to better categorize your apps, arrange them on the screen to your liking, and control how apps are accessed. Yes, this means you can arrange your app icons however you like now, changing their color and moving them to any location on the iOS screen’s familiar grid. There’s also support for hiding apps in a locked apps folder that can only be accessed through Face ID verification, so you can keep all your X and OnlyFans activity away from prying eyes. New tapbacks. Satellite messaging is also coming to iOS 18. There are also helpful updates to Messages. A big one is the ability to schedule messages, a thing that Apple had somehow not supported before. You’ll also get the ability to style text, add fun text effects, and reply to messages with emoji Tapbacks. Here's macOS Sequoia on three different Macs. Apple’s new operating system for Mac is called macOS Sequoia. The stand-out feature among those demonstrated today is called iPhone Mirroring. It allows you to sync your iPhone with your Mac and control nearly everything on the handset from your Mac’s screen. You can make calls, work within apps, and interact with the phone’s home screen. Your phone remains locked while you do this. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The Safari browser will get an update in Sequoia. There’s a new Highlights feature in the browser, which can summarize the most pertinent information contained on a website or within search results. If you’re searching for movies or music, Highlights can instantly pop up with a preview of what you want to watch or listen to. The Highlights feature can also provide directions to the restaurant you’re searching for, or surface menus and reviews in an instant, things like that. iPhone Mirroring More support is coming for games and game developers, including an upcoming second version of Apple’s Game Porting Tookit and new Xcode support that lets developers make games that work across all of Apple’s devices and platforms. A new iPadOS feature cleans up your handwriting and generates a font based on your personal scrawl so you can paste in text and make it look like you wrote it by hand. The iPad is getting some interface updates that aim to make the user experience more intuitive. There’s a floating tab bar that hovers at the top of some apps and aims to stay away from everything you’re doing on the screen, and better customization options for your Control Center. Calculator graphing. But what people are most stoked about is that Apple is finally bringing its Calculator app to the iPad. A revamped version of the calculator app not only works like a calculator, but it has a new feature called Math Notes that lets you use the Apple Pencil (or your finger) to visually work out and solve math problems. It’s bound to be a godsend for kids looking to cheat on their math homework. The watchOS operating system is gaining some new cycle-tracking and pregnancy-tracking features. The Apple Watch will get an update that gives the device new health-tracking features comparable to what’s offered by dedicated sports watches like those from Garmin. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano A new Training Load app analyzes how hard you exercise during workouts, and tracks your workout duration and how your effort changes over time. The new Vitals app passively monitors your health throughout the day and may even suggest you’ve been drinking too much. The new Passwords app. On the security front, Apple is also creating its own dedicated passwords app across its OS platforms. It works like many other password managers, in that it allows you to generate strong passwords for all your logins. It keeps all your credentials in order by storing logins, passwords, and verification codes, and by flagging potential password leaks and security breaches. It’s also available to Windows users on the iCloud for Windows app. Apple’s payments app has a new feature that lets users transfer money far more easily than before. With Tap to Cash, you can initiate a mobile payment and then just hold two iPhones together to transfer the money from one user to another. It’ll make paying back friends for a round of drinks much easier. (Sorry Venmo, you had a good run.) AirPods get gesture controls. Apple’s in-ear headphones will gain new gesture controls that let you nod your head to answer an incoming phone call, or shake your head to decline it. They’re also getting better noise isolation and canceling capabilities, so you can have more easily understandable conversations at your local jackhammer conventions. Apple will add a few software features to its streaming TV platform. There are some accessibility updates, like better subtitles that appear when you mute right when the dialog is spoken, or pop up if you rewind a segment to play it again. There’s also a new “In Sights” banner that pops up when you pause what you’re watching. It shows you the names and faces of the onscreen actors, as well as the characters they’re playing. It can also identify any of the songs that are playing in the scene. (Amazon Prime Video does this too through a feature called X-Ray.) Apple’s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset just came out in February, and Apple has already announced the first substantial update to the face computer’s operating system. The Vision Pro didn’t get great reviews at launch, and so visionOS needs some enhancements to keep pushing the conversation forward. The biggest update for the VisionPro will be coming to Spatial Photos, which will include a feature that makes ordinary pictures look like Spatial photos by giving them stereoscopic depth and movement. Spatial Photos Apple is also enhancing spatial video, partnering with companies like Vimeo, which has a player available as a new app on the VisionPro. Still no YouTube though. (Apple says the Vision Pro can run 1.5 million compatible iPhone apps.) Apple is adding better hand gesture recognition to visionOS, and offering something called Train Support, which is meant to make the Vision Pro work better for people while they’re traveling by rail. In the coming months, Apple says it is also making Vision Pro available to more countries, like China, Japan, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom."
88,Brenda Stolyar,All the Top New Features Coming to MacOS Sequoia,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-macos-sequoia-features/,"Apple has officially debuted macOS 15, which is named Sequoia. We break down all the new features to look forward to, and tell you whether your current Mac will support the new operating system.",2024-06-11T21:06:00Z,"Brenda Stolyar Apple has officially unveiled the latest version of its operating system for Mac. This time around, Apple stuck to its “California places” naming convention and went with macOS Sequoia. (Yes, a sequoia is a type of tree, but it's also a national park in northern California.) Also known as macOS 15, the new OS packs a ton of new capabilities onto the desktop, including a password management app, videoconferencing tools, and updates to Safari, as well as all the features that come with Apple Intelligence—the company's new artificial-intelligence-powered system. Below, we break down all these new features that will become available in macOS Sequoia when it ships this fall. Be sure to also check out our iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 feature roundup for all the new features coming to your iPhone and iPad, and our look at what's new in watchOS 11. MacOS Sequoia, or macOS 15, is a free update for your Apple computers. But some features, like Apple Intelligence (more on that, later), are exclusive to Macs with the M-series Apple silicon chip. To figure out which Mac model you have, click on the Apple icon in the menu bar in the upper-left corner of your display and click About This Mac. We've listed all the models that will be able to run macOS Sequoia below. MacOS Sequoia is currently available only as a developer beta, but the public beta (where everyone can try out the features) will be available in July. Below, we break down all the major features coming to MacOS 15. For a full list, head over to Apple's official preview page. Sometimes your iPhone is in the other room or deep in your bag. For those moments when you need to use it but simply don't feel like getting up to find it, you'll be able to pull it up on your computer. As part of Apple's Continuity features, iPhone Mirroring gives you the ability to both access and interact with your iPhone wirelessly using your Mac. When the feature is in action, you'll see your iPhone's custom home screen appear. From there, you can use the keyboard, trackpad, or mouse to drag and drop content (like photos, videos, and files) between both devices, open and use any of your apps, swipe through all the pages on your home screen, as well as view and respond to notifications. While you're doing all this, your iPhone will remain locked. It also works while your iPhone is in Standby mode, a feature from iOS 17 that turns your iPhone into a smart display while charging. MacOS Sequoia offers a few new features to Safari. With Highlights, Safari will use machine intelligence to show you relevant information from the webpage like directions, links, summaries, and restaurant reviews. Apple also redesigned the Reader to minimize distractions. In addition to a sleeker view of the article, you'll also see a summary and a table of contents (for longer articles). If the webpage includes a video, Viewer will bring it to the forefront while still giving you access to playback controls (Picture in Picture included). Those who always keep a ton of browser windows open simultaneously will appreciate the new Window Tiling feature that helps organize them for a better viewing experience. When you drag a window to the edge of the screen, the new OS will automatically suggest a tiled position on your screen. (It's similar to Snap on Windows.) You can then drop the window into place, arrange multiple windows side by side, or place them in any of the four corners to make room for more apps. For quicker organization, you can use keyboard and menu shortcuts too. Last year, Apple added a ton of new videoconference tools with MacOS Sonoma including Presenter Overlay, Reactions, and various features for the Mac's built-in webcam. This year, the company is adding a few more. With apps like FaceTime and Zoom, you'll have access to a new presenter preview capability that allows you to see what you're about to share before actually sharing it. Meanwhile, the built-in backgrounds feature allows you to apply system wallpapers, color gradients, or your own photos as a backdrop for video calls. Apple says this feature will be available on FaceTime and third-party apps like Webex. If you never loved Keychain, now you have a better option: macOS Sequoia comes with a new Passwords app that allows you to access all your passwords (Wi-Fi passwords included), passkeys, and verification codes in one place. It keeps all your Apple devices in sync, runs on Windows machines (using the iCloud for Windows app) too, and supports end-to-end encryption. A few new Messages features are coming to macOS Sequoia—and by extension, to iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 as well. You'll be able to format your texts within Messages using bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough type treatments. You'll also have the ability to add animated effects to a specific word within a text. For some phrases and words, you'll also see suggestions appear as you type. Apple added new Tapbacks too—instead of using the traditional heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, question mark, or exclamation point, you'll also see options to use emoji and stickers. Another standout new feature is the option to schedule your messages ahead of time so they'll be sent later. In addition to the features above, the company also announced new AI capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence—its “personal intelligence system” built into MacOS Sequoia, as well as iOS 18 and iPadOS 18. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Unfortunately, Apple Intelligence isn't available on all Macs that support macOS 15. You'll need a Mac running the M1 chipset and newer to take advantage of the AI newness. And while some of the AI-powered features will launch in beta this fall, some features won't be available until next year. Below are all the Apple Intelligence–specific features included with macOS Sequoia. Apple's new tools can help you write emails. The system can also take an email you've composed and rewrite it to hit a particular tone. Apple is introducing Writing Tools, which consists of a few different features that work within Notes, Pages, Mail, and third-party apps. There's Rewrite, which allows you to pick from different versions of what you've written based on several tones; Proofread, which checks word choice, grammar, and sentence structure, while also suggesting edits (along with explanations of the edits) with the option to review or quickly accept; and Summarize, which allows you to select text and have it recapped in a paragraph, list, a table, or bulleted key points. Image Playground generates playful images based on three different styles: Illustration, Sketch, and Animation. It's available as a dedicated app, but you can also access it through Messages. To generate an image, you can either pick from the available concepts, type a description of what you're looking for, or choose a photo of someone from your photo library. If you're a fan of the Memories feature in the Photos app, you'll be excited to know that Apple is making it more customizable. Rather than settling for the automated version, you'll be able to create specific stories you want to see by typing in a description. From there, Apple will pick out the best photos and videos that match the description, create a storyline based on themes associated with the photos, and generate a movie with its own narrative. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano Apple also introduced a new Clean Up tool. Similar to Google's Magic Eraser, Clean Up can identify and remove unwanted or distracting objects in the background of the photo without changing the subject. Notes will now come equipped with the ability to transcribe audio sessions, as well as summarize notes. That way, you don't have to focus on physically taking notes. And, with a new Math Notes feature, you'll also be able to type in an equation and have it solved automatically within the body of the note. Apple is finally giving Siri a major overhaul. It's been redesigned to speak more naturally, and it's been given the ability to understand context within conversations. So instead of always having to help Siri along by reminding it what you were asking about in your last question, Siri will simply remember what the topic of the conversation is. This makes conversations feel more personable and easy. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano You'll also be able to interact with Siri by typing in your requests instead of speaking them. The company integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT (using the GPT-4o model) into Siri as well. (It's also available in Writing Tools.) If Siri thinks ChatGPT can help answer a question you've posed, it'll hand off the request to OpenAI's chatbot."
89,Reece Rogers,Reduce AI Hallucinations With This Neat Software Trick,https://www.wired.com/story/reduce-ai-hallucinations-with-rag/,"A buzzy process called retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is taking hold in Silicon Valley and improving the outputs from large language models. How does it work?",2024-06-14T12:00:00Z,"Reece Rogers If you’ve ever used a generative artificial intelligence tool, it has lied to you. Probably multiple times. These recurring fabrications are often called AI hallucinations, and developers are feverishly working to make generative AI tools more reliable by reining in these unfortunate fibs. One of the most popular approaches to reducing AI hallucinations—and one that is quickly growing more popular in Silicon Valley—is called retrieval augmented generation. The RAG process is quite complicated, but on a basic level it augments your prompts by gathering info from a custom database, and then the large language model generates an answer based on that data. For example, a company could upload all of its HR policies and benefits to a RAG database and have the AI chatbot just focus on answers that can be found in those documents. So, how is this process different from a standard ChatGPT output? I asked Pablo Arredondo, a vice president of CoCounsel at Thomson Reuters, who has been using the RAG method to develop aspects an AI tool for legal professionals. “Rather than just answering based on the memories encoded during the initial training of the model,” he says, “you utilize the search engine to pull in real documents—whether it's case law, articles, or whatever you want—and then anchor the response of the model to those documents.” For instance, we could upload the entirety of WIRED’s history, all of the print magazines and web articles since 1993, to a private database and build a RAG implementation that references these documents when answering reader questions. By giving the AI tool a narrow focus as well as quality information, the RAG-supplemented chatbot would be more adept than a general purpose chatbot at answering questions about WIRED and relevant topics. Would it still make mistakes and sometimes misinterpret the data? Absolutely. But the odds of it fabricating entire articles that never existed would definitely go down. “You're rewarding it, in the way that you train the model, to try to write something where every factual claim can be attributed back to a source,” says Patrick Lewis, an AI modeling lead at Cohere who helped develop the concept of RAG a few years ago. If you teach the model to effectively sort through the provided data and use citations in every output, then the AI tool is less likely to make egregious mistakes. Though, exactly how much RAG reduces AI hallucinations is a point of contention for researchers and developers. Lewis carefully chose his words during our conversation, describing RAG outputs as “low hallucination” rather than hallucination-free. The process is definitely not some panacea that eliminates every mistake made by AI. During conversations with multiple experts, it became clear that just how much RAG lowers hallucinations depends on two core things: the quality of the overall RAG implementation, and how you decide to define AI hallucinations, a sometimes fuzzy term without a firm definition. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano To start off, not all RAGs are of the same caliber. The accuracy of the content in the custom database is critical for solid outputs, but that isn’t the only variable. “It's not just the quality of the content itself,” says Joel Hron, a global head of AI at Thomson Reuters. “It's the quality of the search, and retrieval of the right content based on the question.” Mastering each step in the process is critical since one misstep can throw the model completely off. “Any lawyer who's ever tried to use a natural language search within one of the research engines will see that there are often instances where semantic similarity leads you to completely irrelevant materials,” says Daniel Ho, a Stanford professor and senior fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered AI. Ho’s research into AI legal tools that rely on RAG found a higher rate of mistakes in outputs than the companies building the models found. Which brings us to the thorniest question in the discussion: How do you define hallucinations within a RAG implementation? Is it only when the chatbot generates a citation-less output and makes up information? Is it also when the tool may overlook relevant data or misinterpret aspects of a citation? According to Lewis, hallucinations in a RAG system boil down to whether the output is consistent with what’s found by the model during data retrieval. Though, the Stanford research into AI tools for lawyers broadens this definition a bit by examining whether the output is grounded in the provided data as well as whether it’s factually correct—a high bar for legal professionals who are often parsing complicated cases and navigating complex hierarchies of precedent. While a RAG system attuned to legal issues is clearly better at answering questions on case law than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, it can still overlook the finer details and make random mistakes. All of the AI experts I spoke with emphasized the continued need for thoughtful, human interaction throughout the process to double check citations and verify the overall accuracy of the results. Law is an area where there’s a lot of activity around RAG-based AI tools, but the process’s potential is not limited to a single white-collar job. “Take any profession or any business. You need to get answers that are anchored on real documents,” says Arredondo. “So, I think RAG is going to become the staple that is used across basically every professional application, at least in the near to mid-term.” Risk-averse executives seem excited about the prospect of using AI tools to better understand their proprietary data without having to upload sensitive info to a standard, public chatbot. It’s critical, though, for users to understand the limitations of these tools, and for AI-focused companies to refrain from overpromising the accuracy of their answers. Anyone using an AI tool should still avoid trusting the output entirely, and they should approach its answers with a healthy sense of skepticism even if the answer is improved through RAG. “Hallucinations are here to stay,” says Ho. “We do not yet have ready ways to really eliminate hallucinations.” Even when RAG reduces the prevalence of errors, human judgment reigns paramount. And that’s no lie."
90,Bill Sullivan,How to Avoid Getting Sick This Summer,https://www.wired.com/story/summer-sickness-illness-flu-germs-backyard-water/,"A microbiologist explains how to not catch summertime germs at the barbecue, in the pool, or on the trail.",2024-06-15T12:00:00Z,"Bill Sullivan This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. As flowers bloom and temperatures climb, many are eager to get back outside. But while the sun may be shining, there is a dark side that can make the great outdoors not so great. Gangs of germs are lurking in the woods, in the soil, in the water, and in your food, ready to rain on your summer parade. I’m a professor of microbiology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, where I study and teach about infectious disease. Here are some things to keep in mind to help you and your loved ones stay free of illness while enjoying summer activities. There’s nothing like the smell of a good barbecue and fresh goodies from your own garden. To make sure people leave your party with only good memories, be aware of germs commonly linked to food poisoning, which can result in diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Meats, including fish and poultry, often house harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, or Listeria. Raw meat can contaminate anything it touches, so be sure to wash your hands and disinfect surfaces and utensils. To avoid cross contamination, do not keep uncooked meat near prepared foods. Meat products must be cooked to proper temperatures to ensure harmful germs are destroyed before consuming. Washing cooking utensils that touch raw meat can reduce cross contamination. In addition to bacteria, a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii can cause acute food poisoning. Toxoplasma parasites are shed as microscopic oocysts in the feces of infected cats. Oocysts persist in the environment for a year or more, and other animals, including people, can inadvertently ingest them. Upon infection, Toxoplasma forms tissue cysts in the flesh of food animals—another reason to cook your meats thoroughly. Pregnant people need to take special care in avoiding Toxoplasma, since the parasite can cross the placenta and cause miscarriage or birth defects. To avoid getting toxoplasmosis from oocysts, people should wear gloves while gardening, wash fruits and vegetables, and make sure the sandbox is free of cat poop and covered when not in use. Recreational water facilities such as pools, water parks, and fountains are a great way to beat the summer heat. The smell of chlorine is a good sign that the water is being treated to kill many types of germs. Unfortunately, some germs can remain infectious in chlorine for several minutes or days, which is plenty of time to spread from one person to another. These include viruses such as norovirus, bacteria such as E. coli, and parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Christopher Solomon By Martin Cizmar Accidental ingestion of these germs can cause stomach problems, including diarrhea, which can become serious if it leads to dehydration. To avoid becoming infected, swim in well-maintained facilities and avoid swallowing the water. To avoid infecting others, stay out of public water for at least a week if you have diarrhea. While a well-chlorinated pool can kill most germs, some may still lurk in the water. Bacteria in the water that get trapped in the ear can lead to a painful infection known as swimmer’s ear, which can be prevented by wearing earplugs in the water. Ponds, rivers, and lakes can also be home to these diarrhea-causing germs. Warm fresh water may also contain Naegleria fowleri, the so-called “brain-eating amoeba.” While extremely rare, inhaling water containing Naegleria fowleri is almost always fatal. Wearing nose plugs can help prevent infection. If you’re going to reach for the beach, be sure to reach for waterproof bandages if you have an open wound, piercing, or tattoo. Global warming has produced a rise in so-called “flesh-eating bacteria” that cause a dangerous condition called necrotizing fasciitis. These infections can be very difficult to treat and may result in surgical removal of affected tissue or limbs. Shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels filter ocean water as they eat, causing germs to get trapped inside their bodies. Consuming raw shellfish can lead to serious food poisoning due to infection with bacteria or Toxoplasma oocysts. While hiking or camping, you may come across water that looks clean enough to drink, but don’t be tempted. Be sure to boil or properly filter water you drink to avoid bacteria such as E. coli and parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium. These intestinal pathogens will produce cramps, nausea, and diarrhea—especially unpleasant symptoms when you don’t have access to indoor plumbing. By Mark Harris By Matt Kamen By Christopher Solomon By Martin Cizmar After a very mild winter, you can expect a lot of ticks and mosquitoes in the summer, both of which are carriers of serious diseases. As they feed on blood, ticks can inject bacteria that cause Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. They can also transmit a parasite that causes babesiosis. Symptoms of illness following a tick bite should be promptly evaluated by a physician. Insect repellent can help protect you from diseases transmitted through bug bites. Mosquitoes can carry numerous viruses that are injected into the bloodstream while they take a blood meal. Common mosquito-borne viruses in the US include West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis, and Zika. In most cases, these viruses produce flulike symptoms that typically resolve on their own. Infection with Zika virus during pregnancy, however, can lead to birth defects, and West Nile virus can cause acute fever and neurological effects in some people. To avoid tick and mosquito bites, wear insect repellent and keep your skin covered whenever possible. Wear light colors so the insects are more visible to you. Ticks like shade and high grass, so mow your lawn down to about 2 inches in height. Be sure to inspect your body and scalp for ticks after being outside. It is important to pay attention to local news reporting outbreaks of infectious agents in your area or travel destination. With these precautions in mind, you’re sure to have a terrific time, uninterrupted by the germs of summer."
91,Jordan Pearson,Ransomware Is ‘More Brutal’ Than Ever in 2024,https://www.wired.com/story/state-of-ransomware-2024/,"As the fight against ransomware slogs on, security experts warn of a potential escalation to “real-world violence.” But recent police crackdowns are successfully disrupting the cybercriminal ecosystem.",2024-06-10T14:01:49Z," Jordan Pearson Today, people around the world will head to school, doctor’s appointments, and pharmacies, only to be told, “Sorry, our computer systems are down.” The frequent culprit is a cybercrime gang operating on the other side of the world, demanding payment for system access or the safe return of stolen data. The ransomware epidemic shows no signs of slowing down in 2024—despite increasing police crackdowns—and experts worry that it could soon enter a more violent phase. “We’re definitely not winning the fight against ransomware right now,” Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, tells WIRED. Ransomware may be the defining cybercrime of the past decade, with criminals targeting a wide range of victims including hospitals, schools, and governments. The attackers encrypt critical data, bringing the victim’s operation to a grinding halt, and then extort them with the threat of releasing sensitive information. These attacks have had serious consequences. In 2021, the Colonial Pipeline Company was targeted by ransomware, forcing the company to pause fuel delivery and spurring US president Joe Biden to implement emergency measures to meet demand. But ransomware attacks are a daily event around the world—last week, ransomware hit hospitals in the UK—and many of them don’t make headlines. “There is a visibility problem into incidents; most organizations don't disclose or report them,” says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft. He adds that this makes it “hard to ascertain which way they are trending” on a month-by-month basis. Researchers are forced to rely on information from public institutions that disclose attacks, or even criminals themselves. But “criminals are lying bastards,” says Liska. By all indications, the problem is not going away and may even be accelerating in 2024. According to a recent report by security firm Mandiant, a Google subsidiary, 2023 was a record-breaking year for ransomware. Reporting indicates that victims paid more than $1 billion to gangs—and those are just the payments that we know about. A major trend identified in the report was more frequent posts by gangs to so-called “shame sites,” where attackers leak data as part of an extortion attempt. There was a 75 percent jump in posts to data leak sites in 2023 compared to 2022, according to Mandiant. These sites employ flashy tactics like countdowns to when the sensitive data of victims will be made public if they don’t pay. This illustrates how ransomware gangs are ramping up the severity of their intimidation tactics, experts told WIRED. “Generally speaking, their tactics are becoming progressively more brutal,” Callow says. For example, hackers have also begun to directly threaten victims with intimidating phone calls or emails. In 2023, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle was struck by a ransomware attack, and cancer patients were individually sent emails threatening to release their personal information if they did not pay. “My concern is that this will spill over into real-world violence very soon,” says Callow. “When there are millions to be had, they might do something bad to an executive of a company that was refusing to pay, or a member of their family.” By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams While there hasn’t yet been a reported instance of violence resulting from a ransomware attack, gangs have used the threat as a tactic. “We’ve seen in negotiations that have been leaked that they’ve hinted that they might do something like that, saying, ‘We know where your CEO lives,’” Liska says. Speaking of criminals’ callous approach to life and death, it’s worth noting that researchers estimate that, between 2016 and 2021, ransomware attacks have killed between 42 and 67 Medicare patients due to targeting hospitals and delaying life-saving treatments. Liska notes that ransomware gangs don’t operate in a vacuum. Their membership overlaps with entities like “the Comm,” a loose global network of criminals who organize online and offer violence-as-a-service in addition to more traditional cybercrime like SIM swapping. Comm members advertise their willingness to beat people, shoot at homes, and post grisly videos purporting to depict acts of torture. Last year, 404 Media reported that Comm members are working directly with ransomware groups like AlphV, a notorious entity that assisted with a high-profile hack of MGM Casinos before the FBI disrupted its operations by developing a decryption tool and seizing several websites—only to return months later with an attack on Change Healthcare that disrupted medical services around the US. “It makes me very concerned,” Liska says of the link between ransomware gangs and violent cybercriminals. Law enforcement has seen some recent success in disrupting, if not completely eradicating, ransomware groups. In February, an international collaboration dubbed Operation Cronos disrupted the prolific LockBit ransomware operation by seizing its websites and offering free decryption to victims. Officials also arrested two alleged affiliates of the group who were based in Ukraine and Poland. It’s been difficult to make a dent in the volume of ransomware attacks in part because ransomware gangs—which work almost like startups, sometimes offering a subscription service and 24/7 support for their software while they recruit affiliates that carry out attacks—are frequently based in Russia. This has prompted Western law enforcement to turn gangs’ own intimidation tactics and psychological games against them. For example, Operation Cronos used a countdown timer in the style of a ransomware shame site to reveal the identity of LockBit’s alleged boss, 31-year-old Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev. He was also charged in a 26-count indictment by US prosecutors, and sanctioned. Since Khoroshev is apparently in Russia, he’s unlikely to be arrested unless he leaves the country. But revealing his identity can still have the effect of further disrupting his ransomware operation by eroding affiliates’ trust in him and putting a target on his back. “There are a lot of people who will be interested in trying to get their hands on some of his money,” says Callow. “There will be people who would be willing to bash him on the head and drag him across the border to a country from which he can be extradited.” Affiliates may also be concerned about the possibility of his arrest if he voluntarily leaves Russia. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “Law enforcement is adapting to let them know that they are vulnerable,” Liska says. Another obstacle to reining in ransomware is the Hydra-esque nature of affiliates. After the LockBit disruption, analysts saw 10 new ransomware sites pop up almost immediately. “That is more than we’ve seen in a 30-day period at any point,” says Liska. Law enforcement is adapting to this reality, too. In May, an international collaboration called Operation Endgame announced that it had successfully disrupted multiple operations distributing malware “droppers.” Droppers are an important part of the cybercrime ecosystem as they allow hackers to deliver ransomware or other malicious code undetected. Operation Endgame resulted in four arrests in Armenia and Ukraine, took down more than 100 servers, and seized thousands of domains. Endgame employed psychological tactics similar to Operation Cronos, like a countdown to flashy videos containing Russian text and encouraging criminals to “think about (y)our next move.” While the scale of the ransomware problem may seem difficult to get a handle on, both Liska and Callow say it’s not impossible. Callow says that a ban on payment to ransomware gangs would make the biggest difference. Liska was less enthusiastic about the prospects of a payment ban but suggested that law enforcement’s continuing actions could eventually make a real dent. “We talk about whack-a-mole a lot when it comes to ransomware groups—you knock one down and another pops up,” says Liska. “But I think what these [law enforcement] operations are doing is they’re making the board smaller. So yes, you knock one down, and another one pops up. But you wind up with, hopefully, fewer and fewer of them popping up.”"
92,Eric Ravenscraft,Raycon The Magic Power Bank 5-in-1 Review: My New Favorite Portable Charger,https://www.wired.com/review/raycon-the-magic-power-bank-5-in-1/,"I have high standards for my portable batteries. Somehow, Raycon exceeded all of them and then threw in a phone stand.",2024-06-08T14:00:00Z,"Eric Ravenscraft If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED 8/10 I’m picky when it comes to portable chargers. There are plenty of power banks out there with built-in cables and wall plugs, but in a crowded market, it takes a lot more than a 10,000-mAh capacity to catch my eye. That's why I was shocked that Raycon’s Magic Power Bank not only did everything I ever wanted but also some things I didn’t know I could want from a portable battery. And then I discovered the built-in phone stand. This power bank's 10,000-mAh capacity is enough to charge your phone around two times. It also has two charging cables built in—one USB-C and one Lightning cable for older iPhones and Apple devices. Additionally, it has two USB ports (one USB-A and one USB-C) on the front where you can connect additional cables. Raycon calls this a 5-in-1 power bank, but you might’ve noticed those cables and ports only account for four charging options. The fifth sits atop the power bank: a MagSafe-compatible 15-watt wireless charging pad. While only certain iPhones support Apple's magnetic accessory system, the wireless charger will work for any phone that supports the Qi standard. It's worth noting that since this is not Made-for-iPhone-certified, MagSafe iPhones will only be able to take advantage of 7.5-watt charging speeds from the magnetic interface, which essentially means it'll charge slowly. Still, the battery can use all five charging methods simultaneously. (You might need to press the button beneath the digital display to activate the wireless charging for some phones.) If that was all this power bank did, it would be enough to be my new everyday carry battery. But there's more. Recharging the Magic Power Bank is super simple. It has a two-prong wall plug you can plug directly into any typical wall socket (in North America). It can also be recharged via the USB-C port on the front if you don’t have a convenient wall outlet nearby. A rubber loop sits in one corner of the power bank, which makes it easy to latch onto a bag or belt. I often find myself at conventions or festivals where I expect my phone to die more often than usual, and carrying a giant battery in my pocket is cumbersome. This loop is a welcome addition. Even if I don’t want to carry around a bag, I can use a carabiner to latch it to one of my belt loops. On the front of the battery, a digital readout shows the power bank’s current charge. This feature is mercifully becoming more standard on power banks, but it still feels like a nice-to-have. I’ve owned dozens of portable batteries, but only a few that can show me how full they are with this level of accuracy. Once you’ve had that convenience, it’s hard to go back. With the wireless charger, digital readout, and built-in cables/wall plug, I was ready to call this my new favorite portable battery. But I noticed an odd little plastic slider on the bottom. It has a couple of ridges; when I slid it out, it clicked into place. I hadn’t read everything about this battery before I started fiddling with it, so the surprise I felt when I realized what it was for brought me the kind of joy that gadget nerds live for. It was a phone stand. A phone stand! I set the battery on my desk, laid my phone on it sideways, and it rested, tilted up at a slight angle to make it easy to watch a video. I could also prop the phone up in portrait mode to keep an eye on my notifications while my phone was on my desk (or for watching vertical videos). Raycon The Magic Power Bank 5-In-1 Rating: 8/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Raycon didn’t have to add this. I don’t think anyone was clamoring for a portable battery that doubled as a phone stand. But I’m delighted it’s here. I’ve been an advocate for phones with kickstands ever since the HTC Evo 4G, but since most don’t come with one, I’ve had to settle for a phone case with one. I couldn’t be happier that this battery serves this need. I only have two minor annoyances with this power bank. First, the power output isn’t high. The USB-C port dishes out 20 watts, whereas the USB-A outputs 22.5 watts. That's enough to charge most phones or tablets, and while it can technically charge laptops, it’s possible your laptop can use up power faster than this battery can provide it. Raycon advises using it as “an emergency backup” for laptops, but there are more powerful options if you need a battery primarily for PCs. The other minor issue is that it’s not easy to use the phone stand and the included charging cables at the same time. The base of the cable connects to the battery right next to the phone stand, so I could only plug in my phone while resting it in the stand if I slid the phone super far to the side, essentially nestling the corner of my phone in the plastic stand. It’s workable, but a little awkward. But I can accept a little awkwardness in exchange for the most decked-out portable battery I’ve ever used. With two included cables, two more USB charging ports, a MagSafe wireless charging pad, a built-in wall plug, a digital display, and even a phone stand, I can’t think of much more I could ask from a portable battery. Oh, and it’s $80 when it’s not on sale. That makes it cheaper than half of our favorite portable chargers. Hard to get much better than that.

93,Sachi Mulkey,The End of El Niño Might Make the Weather Even More Extreme,https://www.wired.com/story/el-nino-la-nina-extreme-weather-heat-2024/,"The shift from El Niño to La Niña will see temperatures drop, but when one weather system swings to the other, summers tend to be hotter than average—meaning 2024 could be even warmer and wilder than last year.",2024-06-08T11:00:00Z,"Sachi Mulkey This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Summers keep getting hotter, and the consequences are impossible to miss: In the summer of 2023, the northern hemisphere experienced its hottest season in 2,000 years. Canada’s deadliest wildfires on record bathed skylines in smoke from Minnesota to New York. In Texas and Arizona, hundreds of people lost their lives to heat, and in Vermont, flash floods caused damages equivalent to those from a hurricane. Forecasts suggest that this year’s upcoming “danger season” has its own catastrophes in store. On May 23, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be the most prolific yet. A week earlier, they released a seasonal map predicting blistering temperatures across almost the entire country. The driving forces behind these projections include the alternating Pacific Ocean climate patterns known as El Niño and La Niña, which can create huge shifts in temperature and precipitation across the North and South American continents. After almost a year of El Niño, La Niña is expected to take the reins sometime during the upcoming summer months. As climate change cooks the planet and the Pacific shifts between these two cyclical forces, experts say the conditions could be ripe for more extreme weather events.“We’ve always had this pattern of El Niño, La Niña. Now it’s happening on top of a warmer world,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, an environmental data science nonprofit. “We need to be ready for the types of extremes that have not been tested in the past.” During an El Niño, shifting trade winds allow a thick layer of warm surface water to form in the Pacific Ocean, which, in turn, transfers a huge amount of heat into the atmosphere. La Niña, the opposite cycle, brings back cooler ocean waters. But swinging between the two can also raise thermostats: Summers between the phases have higher-than-average temperatures. According to Hausfather, a single year of El Niño brings the same heat that roughly a decade of human-caused warming can permanently add to the planet. “I think it gives us a little sneak peek of what’s in store,” he said. The air shimmers during a 2023 heatwave in Phoenix, Arizona. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Since the World Meteorological Organization declared the start of the current El Niño on July 4, 2023, it’s been almost a year straight of record-breaking temperatures. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, there’s a 61 percent chance that this year could be even hotter than the last, spelling danger for areas prone to deadly heat waves during the summer months. An estimated 2,300 people in the US died due to heat-related illnesses in 2023, and researchers say the real number is probably higher. All this heat has also settled into the oceans, creating more than a year of superhot surface temperatures and bleaching more than half of the planet’s coral reefs. It also provides potential fuel for hurricanes, which form as energy is sucked up vertically into the atmosphere. Normally, trade winds scatter heat and humidity across the water’s surface and prevent these forces from building up in one place. But during La Niña, cooler temperatures in the Pacific Ocean weaken high-altitude winds in the Atlantic that would normally break up storms, allowing hurricanes to more readily form. “When that pattern in the Pacific sets up, it changes wind patterns around the world,” said Matthew Rosencrans, a lead forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. “When it’s strong, it can be the dominant signal on the entire planet.” This year’s forecast is especially dangerous, as a likely swift midsummer transition to La Niña could combine with all that simmering ocean water. NOAA forecasters expect these conditions to brew at least 17 storms big enough to get a name, roughly half of which could be hurricanes. Even a hurricane with relatively low wind speeds can dump enough water to cause catastrophic flooding hundreds of miles inland. “It’s important to think of climate change as making things worse,” said Andrew Dessler, climate scientist at Texas A&M University. Although human-caused warming won’t directly increase the frequency of hurricanes, he said, it can make them more destructive. “It’s a question of how much worse it’s going to get,” he said. Over the past 10 months, El Niño helped create blistering temperatures in some parts of the United States, drying out the land. Drought-stricken areas are more vulnerable to severe flooding, as periods without precipitation mean rainfall is likely to be more intense when it finally arrives, and soils may be too dry to soak up water. As desiccated land and soaring temperatures dry out vegetation, the stage is set for wildfires. While the National Interagency Fire Center expects lower-than-average odds of a big blaze in California this year, in part due to El Niño bringing unusually high rainfall to the state, other places may not be so lucky. The agency’s seasonal wildfire risk map highlights Hawaii, which suffered the country’s deadliest inferno partly as a result of a persistent drought in Maui last August. Canada, which also experienced its worst fire season last summer, could be in for more trouble following its warmest-ever winter. This May, smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Alberta and British Columbia had already begun to seep across the Canadian border into Midwestern states. “We are exiting the climate of the 20th century, and we’re entering a new climate of the 21st century,” Dessler said. Unfortunately, our cities were built for a range of temperatures and weather conditions that don’t exist anymore. To get ready for hurricanes, Rosencrans said people who live in states along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Ocean should go to government disaster preparedness websites to find disaster kit checklists and advice about forming an emergency plan. “Thinking about it now, rather than when the storm is bearing down on you, is going to save you a ton of time, energy, and stress,” he said."
94,Dell Cameron,US Leaders Dodge Questions About Israel’s Influence Campaign,https://www.wired.com/story/israel-us-disinformation-us-lawmakers/,Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has joined US intelligence officials in ignoring repeated inquiries about Israel’s “malign” efforts to covertly influence US voters.,2024-06-11T16:13:26Z,"Dell Cameron Federal lawmakers in the US have dodged repeated inquiries over the past week about a covert operation ordered by the Israeli government to artificially boost support among Americans for its war in Gaza. At the same time, senior White House officials charged with advising President Joe Biden on matters of national security are claiming to have no knowledge of the operation—first disclosed publicly more than four months ago. The operation, formally tied to the Israeli government by a New York Times reporter last week, kicked off in October 2023 following the surprise attack by Hamas in southern Israel. Researchers internationally began work to expose the campaign in February, identifying a flood of “suspicious accounts” on US-based social networking apps, most masquerading as Americans avowing support for the Israeli military response. In addition to eroding support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance to 5.6 million Palestinian refugees, a chief aim of the Israeli operation, researchers say, was to sway the opinions of Black Americans. Per the Times—which cited four current and former Israeli officials in confirming their government had commissioned the campaign—its primary targets included the account of US congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House, among others who are “Black and Democratic.” Accounts tied to the operation—many of which, at the time of writing, remain active on X, despite being suspended on other platforms—promoted a Black Lives Matter hashtag and shared images of Martin Luther King Jr. alongside fabricated quotes. A website created for the operation included articles with titles such as “The leaders of the Civil Rights Movement and Their Support of Jewish People and Israel.” Several examples of accounts used in the operation, many of which were created weeks prior to the Hamas attack on October 7 that killed an estimated 1,200 people, advertised themselves as “Christian.” One of the stolen identities used in the operation, first identified by a researcher in Qatar, was that of Kyle Jean-Baptiste, an up-and-coming Broadway star who died in 2015 after falling from a fire escape. If you have information about the work of the intelligence community or its congressional overseers, contact Dell Cameron at dell_cameron@wired.com or via Signal at dell.3030. Multiple inquiries placed with senior members of Jeffries’ staff, including his communications director, Andy Eichar, have gone unacknowledged for nearly a week. WIRED has attempted to resolve whether Jeffries ever received notification of the operation from US intelligence while Congress was in the midst of debating $14 billion in funding to supplement Israel’s war effort. Israeli forces have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians since Hamas’ October 7 attack, according to Gaza health officials’ estimates, including dozens last Thursday at a United Nations school compound, where the Israeli military is accused of making “improper use” of a US-made bomb. With the exception of the White House’s National Security Council, which on Thursday claimed to have no knowledge of the operation, and Senate Intelligence Committee chair Mark Warner, whose office told WIRED it planned to request a briefing on the matter, press inquiries concerning Israel’s attempts to secretly influence US opinion on the war have been met with a stonewall. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams It is unclear whether Biden may have received a briefing on the operation that included information not shared with his own national security advisers. Said a spokesperson for the National Security Council: “We take all allegations of foreign malign influence seriously.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Avril Haines—formerly No. 2 at the CIA—declined to say whether US intelligence had any knowledge of the operation prior to the June 5 New York Times’ story. It would not reveal whether it issued any notifications to Jeffries or any other US officials targeted by Israel. The ODNI maintains what it calls a “disclosure framework” for notifying victims of influence operations connected with US elections. It is unclear, however, whether the ODNI considers the operation election-related, despite national elections approaching and the deep political divide among US voters over Congress’ support for the Israeli war effort. Haines has previously spoken publicly on how US intelligence responds to this scenario: “When relevant intelligence is collected concerning a foreign influence operation aimed at our election,” she said, a “notification framework” exists to ensure “appropriate notice is given to those who are being targeted so that they can take action.” Multiple attempts to solicit comment over the past week from the House Intelligence Committee have likewise gone unacknowledged by representatives Mike Turner and Jim Himes, the committee’s chair and ranking member, respectively. It is unclear whether they are taking steps similar to their Senate counterparts to investigate the matter. Many of the Israeli operation’s fake posts were found to have been generated using ChatGPT, the digital assistant software developed by OpenAI, which is being integrated into everything from Apple’s new iPhones to the next Microsoft Windows operating system. Notably, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, was recently appointed an adviser to the Homeland Security Department. According to the agency, his role is to advise the US government on how to “prevent and prepare for AI-related disruptions.” Both OpenAI and social media giant Meta have publicly confirmed that the operation was launched by a Tel Aviv–based company called Stoic. Neither US company, however, has disclosed having any knowledge of Stoic being commissioned by the Israeli government. Oft described as an Israeli “campaign marketing firm,” Stoic is reminiscent of Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which similarly used fake accounts registered on social media to promote the Kremlin’s interests, namely by working to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. OpenAI disclosed earlier this month that Stoic had similarly been tracked using fraudulent accounts in an effort to influence the outcome of India’s recent elections. Meta and OpenAI have not responded to requests for comment. A US intelligence assessment published in February that identified threats from foreign countries accused of launching malign influence operations against the US references Israel dozens of times; however, it strictly portrays the Middle East ally as the victim of such campaigns. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams The annual assessment, published by the ODNI three days after Israel’s “multi-platform deception operation” was first revealed publicly by Marc Owen Jones—an assistant professor of Hamad bin Khalifa University specializing in disinformation—speaks only broadly of the influence efforts of US rivals and contains few if any details about any specific operations. The report mentions, for instance, that the Chinese government “reportedly targeted” US politicians on TikTok using accounts run by a propaganda office ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. The revelation of Israel’s involvement follows months of hearings in Washington concerning the impact of what US intelligence calls “malign foreign influence campaigns.” Much of the focus by lawmakers centered on allegations that China might potentially manipulate TikTok to sway public opinion in the US. Jeffries, who is rumored to be the Democratic party’s next choice to become Speaker of the House, was among the 360 US representatives to support taking drastic steps in April that may soon lead to a ban on TikTok in US app stores. Jeffries has joined other US leaders in extending an invitation to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress next month. A letter from Jeffries and Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell to the prime minister last week read: “To build on our enduring relationship and to highlight America's solidarity with Israel, we invite you to share the Israeli government's vision for defending democracy, combatting terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.” Update 1 pm ET, June 11, 2024: Added additional details about the Israeli influence campaign."

It’s also working on an eVTOL aircraft built to ferry two passengers across city skylines, and has a partnership with Volkswagen, which owns a 5 percent stake, to develop a pair of EVs due to arrive in 2026. Xpeng currently makes the P5 and P7 sedans, the G9 SUV (which we were mighty impressed with), and a seven-seat MPV called the X9. This new G6 slots in below the G9, and is positioned as a direct rival to the best-selling Tesla Model Y. It’s coming to several European countries right away, with the brand launching in the UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Iceland in the second half of 2024. Majoring on simplicity, there are just three variants of G6 to pick from. All come fully loaded, complete with a panoramic roof, heated seats front and rear (the fronts are also ventilated), an 18-speaker and 960-watt sound system with noise cancellation, two wireless phone chargers with integrated cooling, a heat pump, and, much like Kia and Hyundai, 800-volt charging with a vehicle-to-load function delivering up to 3.3 kW of power to domestic appliances. All buyers need to do is pick from the five paint options (retina-searing orange, black, white, gray, or silver), choose between a black or white faux leather interior, and decide whether they want a tow bar or not. That's it. The German manufacturers, with their love of charging for every conceivable additional feature, should pay attention. The three variants of G6 start with the RWD Standard, which has a 66-kWh battery pack that sends power to a single motor on the rear axle. This produces 258 horsepower and 440 Nm of torque, which is enough to hit 62 mph in a claimed 6.9 seconds. Range is 270 miles WLTP, and Xpeng claims a 10 to 80 percent charge time of 20 minutes at up to 215 kW. Prices start at €43,000 ($46,300) in the Netherlands, where this brand-hosted drive event took place. Important point: This EV costs €2,990 less the Tesla Model Y. Next up is the €48,000 RWD Long Range. This car sticks with the single-motor layout but increases the net battery capacity to 87.5 kWh, and the power is upped slightly to 286 horsepower while torque stays the same. The result is a slightly sprightlier 0-62 mph time of 6.7 seconds, while WLTP range jumps to 354 miles. Maximum charge rate also increases, to 280 kW, so it too can fill from 10 to 80 percent in a claimed 20 minutes.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The equivalent Model Y has a WLTP range of 373 miles, and is quicker to 62 mph by almost a second, but costs €1,990 more. Lastly, Xpeng has the G6 AWD Performance. You’ll already know this is the one you don’t need: the one with supercar levels of performance guaranteed to thrill your children, upset the dog, and make any other passengers reconsider their choice of breakfast. Priced at €52,000 (undercutting the Tesla by a whopping €7,000), it has the same 87.5-kWh battery but adds a secondary motor to the front axle for all-wheel drive. Total power is 476 hp, torque is 660 Nm—more than a Lamborghini Huracán—and the 0-62 mph time is a claimed 4.1 seconds. Range falls to 341 miles and charge performance is unchanged. The Performance is the one you don’t need, but it’s also the version of G6 tested here because car companies can't help showing off their top models on press launches, and so rarely offer up the models that punters will actually opt for. That said, buyers who go for this range-topping model will want more than a “Performance” badge on the back to set their flagship G6 apart from the cheaper models. Using the same design throughout the range keeps costs down and is no doubt a boon to buyers of the cheaper models, but different wheels and sportier bodywork wouldn’t go amiss to help set the Performance apart. There’s not much flare to the G6’s styling, but the ultra-shallow front and rear light bars help it stand apart (albeit only slightly) from all the other amorphous blobs that EVs in this sector have become. And while we applaud Xpeng for offering such a bright shade of orange in what is otherwise a sea of gray, the black lines on each wheel arch make it look like bits of the bodywork are missing. Perhaps that’s where the bulging arches of the Performance model are supposed to go? Xpeng G6 Rating: 6/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED There are indeed hints of Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E to the silhouette, and while the sloping roofline of a coupe SUV usually robs rear-seat headroom, the relatively tall G6 (1,650 mm versus 1,624 mm for the Model Y) gets away with it. There’s tons of space back there, and a big trunk too, but no frunk. We’re pleased to see Xpeng ditch the G6’s active rear spoiler for the European market, since on Chinese cars it further blocks what is already a fairly shallow rear windshield. Inside, the interior feels well put together. The leatherette seats are comfortable, the panoramic roof floods the cabin with light, and most touchpoints feel of an acceptable quality. There’s nothing particularly clever here, but it gets the job done. There are two 50-watt wireless phone chargers with integrated cooling intended to help them run more efficiently, USB-A and USB-C sockets, and a spacious bit of stowage under the armrest and center console. Bafflingly, there’s no glovebox. We also wish the door bins were lined to dampen the noise of things sliding around in them, and there’s a fair bit of cheap plastic in the lower half of the interior. That said, the design of the dashboard and upper halves of the doors is pleasant, and we’re thankful for Xpeng’s use of physical buttons on the steering wheel. No haptics here. It isn’t all good news, though. Xpeng has joined the frustrating trend of removing physical mirror controls and relocating them to the touch screen. This is fine when first getting comfortable, but a total pain when you need to adjust the mirrors while driving or parking. The 15-inch central display is otherwise decent, with a user interface that responds very quickly to taps and swipes. When needing to navigate around a road closure, we were able to quickly scan around the map for an alternative (from the passenger seat) and plot a new route just as we would on an iPad. Some other infotainment systems, including those from far more established brands, simply aren’t this quick.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Xpeng says the system is getting a major over-the-air upgrade later this summer, including an all-new UI that should make it more intuitive, and new mapping from TomTom. For now, the current system works well enough once you’ve climbed the initially steep learning curve, but aspects such as swiping down from the top to access a shortcuts page aren’t entirely obvious. Temperature controls are all on the screen, too, with even commonly-used functions like seat heating buried beneath three or four taps of the screen. Not good. Hiding the car’s various drive modes—Standard, Eco, Sport, and All-Terrain—in there as well, along with the four brake regen options, means you’re unlikely to ever go hunting for them while on the move. A couple of physical controls would fix all of this. In better news, we’re thankful to see a driver display behind the steering wheel. Just a few years ago this would seem like we’re stating the obvious, but today the Tesla Model 3 and Volvo EX30 both lack any form of instrumentation ahead of the driver. The Xpeng G6 has a 10.2-inch driver display, showing speed, gear, battery percentage (or range, but not both), navigation instructions, and nearby vehicles and road markings spotted by the car’s many cameras. It all works as expected, although the display panel itself seems of quite low quality; the resolution and brightness are both fine, but the viewing angles are so tight that the screen appears completely black from the passenger seat. We’re told this isn’t intentional so are left to assume it’s simply a low-cost panel. Cost-saving measures also mean there’s no head-up display, which is a shame but not unusual at this price point. Time to get on the road. Right away, the steering needed adjusting from its firmest Sport setting to Standard. The former feels artificial and far too heavy, and is best avoided, while the latter is much more in line with what you’d want from a sensible EV like this.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED There are four levels of brake regen on offer, but none of these provide a true one-pedal experience, since even the strongest mode, called X-Pedal, doesn’t bring the car to a stop without a press of the brake pedal. With Standard steering, Standard performance, and X-Pedal braking locked in, we’re just about content. The G6 rides well for its price, and the double-wishbone front suspension and five-link rear axle do a decent job of keeping the car’s composure. It feels more comfortable than the stiffly sprung Tesla Model Y, and at 1,920 mm, the G6 is narrower than the 1,978-mm Tesla, making it easier to thread through the narrow streets we encountered on our drive around the outskirts of Amsterdam. Visibility is good, thanks to relatively svelte A-pillars that don’t obscure the driver’s view too much when approaching junctions and roundabouts. The driving position is good, too, thanks to all models of G6 having an eight-way adjustable driver’s seat with four-way lumbar support. Given the massive power and torque on offer, the G6 Performance accelerates more quickly than it has any right to. It sprints along highway on-ramps with real potency, but as ever with high-power electric SUVs it all feels rather unnecessary. We preferred leaving the powertrain in its standard, less powerful mode, and frankly would have preferred to drive the Long Range model instead, as that will surely be the best-seller. Of far greater importance is the G6’s charge speed, which is claimed to max out at 280 kW in ideal circumstances (charger speed, battery charge, temperature, and such). We didn’t have a chance to deplete the battery far enough to reach those speeds, but saw it leap up to 150 kW when there was still more than 60 percent in the battery. On efficiency, we averaged 3.8 miles per kWh after several hours of town and highway driving. This would likely fall during a longer high-speed cruise, but it’s a decent result considering we put no effort into driving economically. As a snapshot of estimated range, we saw an indicated 352 km at 66 percent, which suggests a total of 533 km or 331 miles, just 10 miles short of Xpeng’s WLTP claim. All versions of G6 come with an 18-speaker, 960-watt sound system made by Xpeng itself. Despite the home-cinema-like 7.1.4 layout, where seven speakers to the front, side, and rear of the cabin are joined by a subwoofer in the trunk and four more speakers in the roof lining (plus more in the headrests of the front seats), this is not a Dolby Atmos system, and, in truth, sounded fairly average. It isn’t bad—there’s plenty of power and it retains clarity at higher volume—but it doesn’t impress in the way the numbers suggest. There’s also active noise canceling, but since this can’t be turned on or off, it’s hard to tell how much tire roar and wind noise it’s removing. Xpeng G6 Rating: 6/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Xpeng prides itself on the technology of its cars. The G6 boasts 29 sensors—including five millimeter-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic wave radars, and 12 cameras—and runs on an Nvidia Orin-X processor with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8155P cockpit chip. This is all used to run the in-house infotainment system (wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are coming via a software update later this year, apparently) and the company’s XPilot safety system. This includes all of the usual autonomous safety tech, like emergency braking, blind spot warnings, and traffic light recognition, plus lane-keep assist and the G6’s active cruise control. As with so many modern cars, the G6 sometimes misreads road signs and incorrectly warns its driver about being over the speed limit. There is no European equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised). So while the G6 can be bought with lidar and more advanced semiautonomous driving in China, that’s missing from its EU offering. As it stands, the system works well enough, but isn’t the most intuitive—our test car didn’t make any sort of sound to indicate when the system was enabled or disabled, and none of the steering wheel buttons used to manage speed and distance are labeled. The result is you’re going to mistake the volume control for the speed adjuster on your first outing. Lastly, the voice assistant responded quickly to “Hey Xpeng,” but until its grasp of English is improved, it offers less functionality than in China. We asked it for the weather forecast, but it replied with the car’s range. Better was how it understood a passenger stating “I’m cold” and turned up the temperature on that side only. Should you buy the Xpeng G6? Massive import tariffs mean Chinese cars remain off the menu in the US, but if you’re in Europe the G6’s competitive price could be appealing (but maybe not for much longer). It matches up to the Tesla Model Y in a lot of key aspects, and even exceeds its American rival when it comes to price, the upcoming inclusion of CarPlay and Android Auto, and ride quality. But there’s still work to be done for the G6 to fully impress. It’s disappointing that we couldn’t try out the major UI update, called version 15, that’s due to roll out in July. But that at least demonstrates Xpeng is keen to quickly evolve, even if that means swapping out the entire mapping system for an alternative and reworking the user interface layout to accommodate smartphone casting. We applaud that, and look forward to seeing what other tech upgrades it has planned. All that said, the G6 left us cold. It carries a lot of kit for the price, and a visit to Xpeng’s cavernous Dutch showroom suggests it means business, literally parking itself between Kia and Nio. It also has a roadmap for infrastructure expansion, partnering with existing service center groups to give buyers peace of mind. But there’s little here to really set the G6 apart from high-quality rivals like the Kia EV6, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Škoda Enyaq, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and of course, the Tesla Model Y. Upstarts need to offer something new. Tesla’s Supercharger network drew in customers during its early years; Nio offers battery swapping; BYD already had enormous scale on its side before entering Europe. For now, Xpeng feels like an also-ran. The G6 is a par-for-the-course EV that will appeal to drivers who want exactly this combination of size, range, price, and fast charging but don’t care about the badge. If that’s you, fine, but for now the G6 does little to get WIRED truly excited. Xpeng G6 Rating: 6/10 If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

97,Boone Ashworth,Artifact’s DNA Lives on in Yahoo’s Revamped AI-Powered News App,https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-news-app-relaunch-artifact/,"Artifact, the news app startup from Instagram's cofounders, was purchased by Yahoo earlier this year. The web giant then used some of Artifact's AI smarts to supercharge its own mobile news app.",2024-06-13T13:00:00Z,"Boone Ashworth Today Yahoo is debuting a revamped version of its news app. This new Yahoo News app, which is available as a free download now, is powered by the underlying code of the well-received yet short-lived app Artifact. And of course, the new app is infused with AI capabilities to surface the news articles that might interest you most. Artifact was a news reader app that launched in 2023 and was helmed by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It made heavy use of AI, employing algorithms to process user behavior and serve readers highly personalized content based on which news stories they engaged with. A little more than a year after it started, the Artifact team shut down the service after it became clear it wasn’t growing enough. Though the app may have floundered, its resurrection was swift. In April, Yahoo announced it had bought Artifact with the goal of bringing Yahoo users “more content tailored to their interests.” Just a little more than two months later, that plan has emerged in the form of the revamped Yahoo News app. Yahoo News is gigantic. It’s the biggest news platform in the US, with more than 185 million monthly visitors. Now, Yahoo hopes to use the machine intelligence engine behind Artifact to revitalize its app by sharpening its powers of personalization, a move that could help Yahoo hop headfirst into the AI scrum. The new Yahoo News app is free (though ad-supported), available on iOS and Android, and can be used with or without a Yahoo account. This AI push for the News app comes a few days after Yahoo introduced AI updates to its Mail app. Yahoo is also adding generative AI summaries of news articles. In the new app, users will see a prompt in some stories to generate “Key Takeaways.” After tapping the prompt, users will see a quick summary load after a second or two of computation. The AI summaries appear in the desktop version of Yahoo News too, but only for a small subset of users who are selected and then choose to opt in. The recommendation features enabled by the Artifact-driven algorithms in the Yahoo News app are only mobile for now. They aren’t powering the desktop version of Yahoo News yet, but Yahoo says the goal is to eventually synchronize features across all platforms. Kat Downs Mulder, senior vice president and general manager of Yahoo News, says the update is a “complete top to bottom redesign of our Yahoo News app.” Even at first glance, the difference is immediately noticeable. The app looks slick and uncluttered, and it’s simple to navigate. And behind the scenes, there’s a variety of AI algorithms pulling strings to show you what you want to see. Some of these features are powered by proprietary technology, and some are powered by the AI bigwigs Yahoo has partnered with, like OpenAI. By Christopher Solomon By Andrew Williams By Adrienne So By Medea Giordano The actual articles displayed in the app are curated from news websites and are available without paywalls or subscription requirements. (Yahoo News partners with more than 1,000 publishers, who get paid based on revenue sharing agreements. It’s kind of like Spotify, but for news.) Getting started requires minimal effort. When you launch it, the app asks you to pick five or more news topics you’re interested in, like politics, science, gaming, and climate. From there, a combination of algorithmic curation and some human finagling from people in an editorial role at Yahoo News determine what you see. Additional customization options let you block individual publications or keywords if you don’t ever want to see them in your feed again. (Something like “Elon,” for example.) Downs Mulder says what you see in the new Yahoo News app is the result of a careful balance of AI and editorial decisionmaking. It’s tailored to your interests, while also showing a Top Stories section that displays what Yahoo considers the most important stories of the day. Those are decided on via a symbiotic process where AI flags stories that seem to have more heft or user interest, and people in editorial roles at Yahoo News decide to include the stories that seem most important. The team also wants to keep the app from being annoying, and Yahoo says it’s intentional about which notifications you get pestered with. “People want places to spend their time that are going to help them save time and get what they want to get done, done,” Downs Mulder says. “And in this case, that’s getting informed, having things to talk about.” Still, the main problems with recommendation algorithms that aggressively track user behavior and promote news stories with high engagement is that they often reinforce bias and can lead to the spread of misinformation. If you can select exactly what news sources and what types of stories you want delivered to you, there’s a risk that you’ll get locked into an echo chamber. Downs Mulder says Yahoo is trying to very carefully walk that ethical tightrope of delivering what users want to read without causing troublesome side effects. “I really like the way this app has come together, because it does balance that Top Stories with that ‘for you’ in a way that’s going to provide you that awareness of what I need to know and what I want to know,” Downs Mulder says. “That’s what’s going to keep a reader from getting too far down a rabbit hole.” Another one of Artifact’s bias-combating features that shows up in the redesign is the ability for clickbait headlines to get rewritten on the fly. Users who see a headline that feels like clickbait can flag it, and once enough people have reported it, the headline will be replaced in the app with a clearer, often more direct rewrite. The new headlines are composed by the generative AI engine and fine-tuned by Yahoo’s human news curators. To keep people clicking, the Yahoo News app also includes an element of gamification, where the app tracks how many articles you read and bestows fun titles upon you to mark your level of effort. Read enough stories and you’ll get rewarded with a badge. For example, reading one story gets you the Learner title, while going up to 250 reads labels you a Sage, which Yahoo says labels you “one of the top readers on Yahoo News” within the app. The Artifact-ification of the News app might also pave the way for future features across Yahoo. Downs Mulder envisions a future where those reading badges pay off in a more finite way. If someone is classified as a Sage, they might be treated as having more authority or credibility within the broader Yahoo community. Some former Artifact features haven’t quite made their way into the new Yahoo News. The pre-Yahoo version of Artifact included a feature that used AI voices to read articles aloud, including AI-generated voices that sounded like rapper Snoop Dogg and not-rapper Gwyneth Paltrow, among others. That option isn’t in Yahoo News yet, though when asked about it, Downs Mulder says more features are coming to the Yahoo News app in the near future, and some of them will be along those lines. “I would just encourage you to stay tuned,” she says."

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The fashion industry writ large reinforces gender norms in many ways, but there’s one every one of us encounters daily: gendered sizing and styling. A faceless entity decides what a man or woman should look like, and if you don’t fit either mold or identify with either label, that’s your problem. Thankfully, there's a growing segment that offers tools to opt out of that binary. Gender-neutral and gender-inclusive clothing brands offer a wider range of fits and styles than you might find at a traditional company. These companies make clothes for queer, nonbinary, and trans bodies of all shapes and sizes. I've tested and worn dozens of these and whittled down my favorites below. Every garment in this list links to its manufacturer and also some other retailers that carry these garments. On some third-party retailer websites, the items we've highlighted are placed in gendered clothing sections, which is disappointing considering it's 2024 and these items are explicitly gender-neutral. I'm just giving you a heads-up so you're not surprised to see the gender-neutral underwear I recommended get categorized as “for women” at Amazon. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Photograph: Both& Both& offers a wide assortment of tops and bottoms based on a sizing system the company developed independently. Rather than using existing size frameworks, Both& developed its signature length-to-width ratio by surveying its community, asking people what they liked and didn’t like about the way traditionally sized clothing fit their bodies. Photograph: Both& The result can be seen best in its signature tees. Not only are they made from durable heavyweight cotton, but they also hang on your body in a way that creates a silhouette that steps outside the shapes that gendered garments often reinforce. The Khazeel tee, for instance, hangs in such a way that it easily conceals the presence of a binder, while the drop shoulder cut hangs off of, rather than skims, the body. Photograph: TomboyX I’ve been a TomboyX wearer for years now and can’t help but sing its praises. With everything from shorts, briefs, and thongs to bras and outerwear, I’ve never had a TomboyX garment that disappointed. Underwear can be tricky for queer and trans people for any number of reasons, but TomboyX has a wide variety of cuts and fits, with sizes that go up to 6X. Photograph: TomboyX I’m a big fan of the bikini briefs and boy shorts for everyday wear, and the 9-inch shorts for wearing around the house or under skirts. The bra selection is also one of my favorites of any company on this list. TomboyX offers traditional number-letter sizing on some of its bras but offers standard S to 4X type sizing on other bras. If you’ve had trouble finding a bra that fits, I can’t recommend the all-day bralette enough. It offers support and breathability, plus fits perfectly under any top. Photograph: Wildfang Originating in my hometown of Portland, Oregon, Wildfang has been a mainstay of the gender-neutral fashion scene for years. Its founders sought to break free from gender norms and offer clothes that can be feminine, masculine, neither, or all of the above. With inclusive sizing going up to 4X on some garments (unfortunately, some top out at 3X) and including tall sizes, it’s pretty easy to find things that will fit your body no matter your body’s shape or gender presentation. Some of the pants do tend to have a higher crotch than you might expect, even on the larger sizes, so you might have to size up on those depending on your proportions—or get the tall size. I’m a huge fan of the high-waisted coverall. Not only do you get to wear a flight suit like an astronaut or space miner, but they’re fashionable, come in a variety of vibrant colors, and fit so well you’ll want to wear it all the time even if it’s way too warm out to be wearing a full-body coverall. Photograph: Wildfang Another mainstay of my wardrobe (and my partner’s) is the essential cropped button-up. As just an outer layer, it can turn a sports bra and a pair of pants into an outfit, and the fit hangs off your body rather than squeezing it or circus-tenting off of it like traditionally sized men’s button-ups can. Photograph: Thistle and Spire I’ve historically had a complicated relationship with lingerie. If it fits my bust, it doesn’t fit my shoulders; if it fits my waist it doesn’t fit my butt, and so on. I could write a dissertation on the lingerie brands that have failed me. Instead, I want to highlight my new favorite: Thistle and Spire. If you’re active in online sex worker (OnlyFans, Fansly, etc.) communities, you’ve seen some of these garments, for good reason. Thistle and Spire offers inclusive sizing and size details on its garments that tell you what you need to know about how each item fits. A part of the reason for that is its dedication to offering garments that will make you feel hot no matter your size, gender, or sexual orientation. And you’ll see that dedication reflected in the models wearing each garment. Finding lingerie modeled by someone with a body that looks like yours is an extremely affirming experience. Photograph: Thistle and Spire Thistle and Spire’s entire catalog is ornate, sexy, and creative, but my favorite is the Medusa set. The bralette fits my bust (and shoulders) perfectly and offers a high degree of adjustability to make sure it fits the body just right. The same goes for the matching bottoms. Here’s another thing Thistle and Spire does that feels like it should be impossible: the lingerie is comfortable. It supports my body where it needs to be supported, and it’s comfy to wear for long periods, so much so that you’ll want to wear it everywhere—you can! Just throw on some pasties (Thistle and Spire offers these too) and you can wear the bralette as an actual top. They even ship in a mesh bag you can use to wash them (in delicate mode). Photograph: Fluxion Shopping for a binder is hard. The best results you’ll get come from stores that take your measurements and custom-make you a binder made for your specific body, but that can take a long time, and it’s expensive. When shopping for binders for my partner, hearing about the wait filled them with dread. So I set out to find a middle option: a binder that fits them the way they want and ships in a shorter time frame. That’s how I found the Fluxion. The binders are durable and well-made, with sturdy stitching on every seam, and a comfortable cotton lining inside a Lycra shell. It feels like a tight swimsuit material, and during testing I found it does a great job of binding a large bust on a small frame, or a medium bust on a large frame. Because they're made from Lycra, they do stretch out and need to be washed to get the tautness back. That’s something you don’t have to worry about as much on binders made from non-stretch fabrics or custom-made binders like those offered by companies like Shapeshifters.

99,Nathaniel Peutherer,Ukrainian Sailors Are Using Telegram to Avoid Being Tricked Into Smuggling Oil for Russia,https://www.wired.com/story/shadow-fleet-shipping-russia-ukraine-climate-change/,Contract seafarers in Ukraine are turning to online whisper networks to keep themselves from being hired into Russia’s sanctions-busting shadow fleet.,2024-06-15T11:00:00Z,"By Nathaniel Peutherer This story originally appeared in Hakai Magazine and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. A new video appears on the social media network Telegram: footage of the smoking area aboard a large vessel. The curtains are ripped, the lights are broken, and ash and glass litter the floor. “This is how they drink on our ship,” says the young Ukrainian deck worker filming the scene, turning to show the furniture thrown to the corner of the room. “I’m freaked out.” A Telegram administrator asks the deck worker if he can share the vessel’s name. They change the ship’s name multiple times a year, replies Feliks Bondar, whose own name has been changed for this story. “I don’t even know what name to tell you,” he writes in Ukrainian. “Our ship was originally called Eagle, but in Venezuela, we were Matador and then Shoyo Maru.” A chorus of similar messages had flooded the chat in recent months: stories of dangerously rundown ships, operators withholding pay, abandoned crew members, and vessel owners changing ship names or manipulating their automatic identification systems (AIS)—the global network meant to help ships recognize each other. The Telegram group hosts over 8,000 sailors. Some are fresh out of maritime college, others are seasoned captains. All are drawn to the group by a desire to stay safe on the high seas. By telling their stories and naming names—when they can—these sailors have been gathering information about problematic vessels, detailing everything from those with low-quality food to ships where crews often experience pay delays. But in recent years, as more sailors are finding themselves unwittingly involved in the so-called shadow fleet—smuggling oil for Iran, Russia, or other clients that have been hit by strict sanctions to restrict their sales of oil—the social media whisper network has evolved. As well as a place to find a reputable employer, it’s become something else: a way for seafarers to avoid helping the other side of a war. Life as a contract seafarer has never been easy. Workers frequently hop from ship to ship, contract to contract, and country to country. But the rise of the shadow fleet—along with Russia’s war in Ukraine—poses a new kind of risk. About a year and a half ago, in early 2023, Bondar sought out the seafarers’ Telegram network after a particularly troubling gig. Booked to the job by an Ukraine-based crewing agency, Bondar found that the name of his assigned vessel had been painted over, and the AIS was, once again, unplugged. A note on top of the device warned seafarers not to turn it on. After a six-month voyage smuggling sanctioned oil to China, Bondar says the crew was told its next operation would begin in Koz’mino, Russia. Russia’s most recent invasion of Ukraine had begun while he was at sea and had already been underway for over four months. Bondar and the other Ukrainians on board refused to work smuggling Russian oil. The ship’s operator allegedly fired them all, ditching them at the nearest port in China. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams “Nothing will surprise me anymore,” Bondar wrote in the Telegram group. “I have accumulated enough ‘sea stories’ for the rest of my life.” The war in Ukraine is taking a huge toll, not only on the soldiers on the front lines but on Ukrainians worldwide. Earlier this year, Stella Maris, an English charity committed to seafarer well-being, reported that depression and anxiety are rising among Ukrainian seafarers. These Ukrainians are trying to provide for their families while worrying about the safety of their loved ones, the future of their homeland, tensions with Russian seafarers, and the fear of conscription if they return home. With Russian troops capitalizing on Ukraine’s temporary weapons shortage—caused by the delayed delivery of Western aid—the plight of Ukraine’s people, including its seafarers, shows little sign of letting up. Bondar’s was not an isolated incident. Recruitment for the shadow fleet is a complex web of crewing agencies, shell companies, and absentee ship owners. Crewing agencies, tasked with finding seafarers to fill contracts, often know very little about the ships, their cargo, or their owners, creating the ideal conditions for deception. But maritime recruitment data shows that at least six Ukrainian crewing agencies have been involved in sourcing seafarers for 10 Russian ships smuggling oil since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tracking vessels through their myriad identity changes is difficult, but possible. The names of vessels in the fleet change regularly, but their identification numbers do not. Mazhnuna Karaca, head of operations at Dese Crew Management, a Ukraine-based crewing agency, says she only found out after the fact that her company had been unintentionally trying to solicit seafarers for illegal Russian oil-smuggling operations. On February 8, 2023, an advertisement seeking crew for a large oil tanker appeared on maritime job forums. The ship’s official identification number along with anything else that might easily identify the vessel were conveniently absent. Karaca, however, confirmed the ship to be the Danica, a vessel that had been featured on a shadow fleet watch list compiled by United Against Nuclear Iran, a US-based nonprofit, since December 2022. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By Matt Kamen By Andrew Williams Ships such as the Danica that transport illegal oil violate sanctions meant to restrict the economic opportunities of nations that threaten global security. In so doing, the vessels’ owners enable those nations to fund their activities. Dese Crew Management tried to recruit seafarers for the Danica and two other ships that were later revealed to be part of the Russian shadow fleet. Fortunately, says Karaca, her company never succeeded in sending anyone to the Danica or any of the other known shadow fleet ships during their illicit operations. But only “because rumors spread quickly between sailors,” she says. Each time Dese found a suitable candidate for the Danica, the sailor would abruptly change their mind and refuse to board. That had puzzled Karaca and her staff—until she learned about a different online seafarer whisper network, where details were whirling. Among seafarers, the company that owns the Danica had a reputation. Digging in deeper, Karaca says the company was originally named Sand & Sea Marine—before it rebranded to Linda Shipping in an attempt to escape its reputation for unsafe conditions, withholding pay, and abandoning crew. Once aware of the Danica’s and the other ships’ involvement in the shadow fleet, Dese Crew Management promptly blacklisted the vessels. Other crewing agencies, however, have been less helpful. On Telegram, some seafarers even believe that crewing agencies have infiltrated the group to post fake positive reviews about the conditions aboard vessels for which they are trying to recruit crew. Fortunately, the seafarers aren’t so gullible: “This is automated bots or the manager has told everyone to write for them,” one sailor wrote below a suspiciously positive set of reviews. “They shout so much that they are not scammers that I think the opposite,” another adds with a laugh. During an assembly in December 2023, the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—the branch of the United Nations tasked with managing international maritime transport—urged member states to do more to derail the shadow fleet. The IMO has encouraged cooperation between coastal member states to help identify suspicious ship-to-ship transfer operations and AIS manipulation, citing risks to “the safety, well-being, and potential criminalization of the crew.” The European Union has called for similar actions while also announcing new sanctions that require the details of any tanker being sold to a Russian entity—including information about the buyer and seller—to be disclosed publicly, opening the door for governments to step in and block the sale if they think the ship might find its way into the shadow fleet. So far, international regulators have yet to comment on the role crewing agencies play in supplying workers to the shadow fleet. Future guidance could extend the Maritime Labour Convention, calling on member states to ensure that independent crewing agencies operating within their territory receive the IMO numbers of the vessels they work with before advertising positions to seafarers. Until the shadow fleet is brought under control, seafarers will continue whispering over the water and doing what they can to keep themselves—and each other—safe."
