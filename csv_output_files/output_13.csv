0,Victoria Bisset,Florida woman's Apple Watch traces lost luggage to airport worker's home,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/06/06/lost-luggage-tracking-apple-watch-florida-airport-worker/,The Spirit Airlines passenger showed up to a man’s home in Fort Lauderdale after her Apple Watch pinged from that address.,2024-06-07T01:15:57Z,"A shop worker at a South Florida airport was charged with stealing thousands of dollars in electronics and clothing after a woman showed up to his home looking for missing luggage that she tracked to his address by using a signal from her Apple Watch. An arrest affidavit for Junior Geneus Bazile, 29, was filed in March but did not name the woman. However, Paola Garcia told Local 10 News this week that she was the passenger involved in the incident at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. According to the affidavit, the pink suitcase contained an Apple MacBook, an iPad, an Apple Watch, jewelry and high-end women’s clothing, worth more than $5,000 in total. The affidavit from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office says Garcia’s flight was canceled and passengers were advised to retrieve their luggage from a carousel at the airport. She told the local news station she stood waiting for the bag, which contained a laptop she needed for her university studies, at a carousel for at least two hours. But it never arrived. Garcia told Local 10 News that she normally carries the bag on board with her, but on this occasion, Spirit Airlines employees forced her to check it. When she used an Apple feature to “ping” her electronic items, she discovered they were at a home in Fort Lauderdale. She traveled to the address the following day and was unable to make contact with the residents. She told police that she saw several pieces of luggage, but none were hers, according to the affidavit. A detective then searched for the address in internal employee databases from the airport, and discovered it was a match for Bazile, who was at work at a store in the airport on the day the luggage disappeared. CCTV footage showed Bazile entering the storage room of the shop he worked at with a pink hard-shell roller bag, matching the description of Garcia’s stolen luggage. After placing the suitcase underneath the desk, he took out a MacBook and other items, which he placed into separate bags. It is unclear how or when the suitcase was taken. According to Local 10 News, Garcia’s items were not recovered. Paradies Lagardère, where Bazile worked, said in an emailed statement Thursday that the company “takes this matter very seriously. Immediately upon learning of the incident, this employee was terminated.” Bazile was charged with grand theft and has a hearing set for August. Spirit Airlines said in an email that although it was “not aware of any evidence that any Spirit employee was involved,” it issued a reimbursement check to the passenger “as a courtesy.” A lawyer for Bazile did not immediately respond to overnight requests for comment. This is not the first time that passenger electronics have been used to uncover theft by airport workers: In 2022, an airline subcontractor in Florida was charged with two counts of grand theft after investigators cross-referenced the last location of an Apple AirTag in a missing suitcase with the addresses of nearby employees, leading them to a home containing more than $16,000 in stolen items. But the case has once again brought attention to the issue of missing and stolen luggage — and what to do if your own belongings go missing while you’re traveling. U.S. Department of Transportation figures for January to March of this year found that more than 650,000 bags on direct domestic flights were mishandled — or 0.58 per 100 of those placed on board. The figure represents a slight decrease from almost 700,000 over the same period last year. (The figures do not break down the number of lost or stolen items.) If your bag is lost, the airline is responsible for returning it, so the first step is to file a claim at the airline’s baggage desk. You may be entitled to compensation — or the cost of your checked-bag fee — but this can vary between airlines, and you’ll need to hold on to any receipts if you’re trying to recoup the costs of replacement items. Travel insurance is important to protect you if your luggage is lost or stolen, the experts say. Make sure your items are easily identifiable and take photos of them in case you need to file a report, and try to include your address on both the outside and the inside of the luggage. Try not to check your bags if at all possible — although this may not always be practical for travelers or, as Garcia’s case shows, even an option. You can also consider placing Apple AirTags or other location tracking devices inside your suitcase, though you’ll need to make sure they’re compatible with your phone. The Federal Aviation Administration says lithium-powered trackers are allowed in checked luggage, with some limits. And if you do find your item isn’t where it’s supposed to be, make sure to inform the police rather than trying to track it down in person. As Garcia told Local 10 News of police’s response when they heard she had gone to the address: “The first thing the police told me was like, ‘What are you doing here? This is so dangerous for you to be here.’” Natalie B. Compton contributed to this report. How we travel now: More people are taking booze-free trips — and airlines and hotels are taking note. Some couples are ditching the traditional honeymoon for a “buddymoon” with their pals. Interested? Here are the best tools for making a group trip work. Bad behavior: Entitled tourists are running amok, defacing the Colosseum, getting rowdy in Bali and messing with wild animals in national parks. Some destinations are fighting back with public awareness campaigns — or just by telling out-of-control visitors to stay away. Safety concerns: A door blew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jet, leaving passengers traumatized — but without serious injuries. The ordeal led to widespread flight cancellations after the jet was grounded, and some travelers have taken steps to avoid the plane in the future. The incident has also sparked a fresh discussion about whether it’s safe to fly with a baby on your lap."
1,Tim Carman,Champion barred from professional eating contest over Impossible Foods deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/06/11/joey-chestnut-nathans-hot-dog-contest-impossible-foods/,Competitive eater Joey Chestnut won’t be allowed to participate in Nathan’s hot dog eating contest after endorsing Impossible Foods’ plant-based dog.,2024-06-12T16:42:44Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. Joey “Jaws” Chestnut, widely considered the greatest professional eater in history, won’t be allowed to compete at the Nathan’s Famous hot dog eating contest after signing an endorsement deal with plant-based company Impossible Foods. The deal with Impossible, which is trying to attract more meat eaters with its new plant-based hot dog, does not prohibit Chestnut from entering eating competitions, including Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog-Eating Contest on July 4. “We love Joey and support him in any contest he chooses. It’s OK to experiment with a new dog. Meat eaters shouldn’t have to be exclusive to just one wiener,” the California-based company said in a statement. But Nathan’s demands loyalty from its competitors — at least when it comes to hot dog brands, said George Shea, chair and co-founder of Major League Eating, the governing body for numerous competitive eating contests, including Nathan’s. A key agreement for all competitors at the Nathan’s contest — where people ompete for the “Mustard Belt” and prize money in front of ESPN’s cameras — is to “not represent a rival hot dog brand,” Shea told The Washington Post. The latest contract between Chestnut and Nathan’s had expired, Shea said, and the two sides were negotiating a new one when Chestnut announced he had signed a deal with a “plant-based firm.” Nathan’s didn’t know then that it was with Impossible. Shea said Nathan’s had asked Chestnut for a potential carve-out: Could he represent all other products in the company’s line, except for its plant-based hot dogs? “And they said no, and that was where we got to an impasse,” Shea said. “We just got surprised by this.” It wouldn’t be the only surprise for Shea and Nathan’s. Chestnut also has a mano-a-mano eating contest with Takeru “Kobi” Kobayashi scheduled for Labor Day on Netflix, the streaming service announced Wednesday. Impossible Foods wouldn’t comment on its deal with Chestnut. But in signing with Impossible, Chestnut apparently walked away from a lucrative deal with Nathan’s, which was prepared to offer the 16-time winner an annual $300,000 appearance fee over four years, said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. “I was very disappointed to learn from the media today that after nearly 20 years I am banned from the Nathan’s 4th of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,” Chestnut said in an Instagram post. “I love competing in that event, I love celebrating America with my fans all over this great country on the 4th and I have been training to defend my title.” A post shared by Joey Chestnut (@joeychestnut) Chestnut could not immediately be reached for comment. Chestnut’s absence will mean that a new champion will be crowned on July 4, when 35,000 people are expected to gather at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island to watch the most advanced eaters in the world try to pound down more than 60 dogs in 10 minutes. Chestnut has not lost since 2015 when Matthew Stonie took home the trophy. Chestnut still holds the Nathan’s record: In 2021, he wolfed down 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. As part of its new brand campaign to attract more meat eaters into its fold, Impossible Foods may have landed the world’s most famous carnivore. “Listen up, America, meat has problems,” says one meathead in Impossible’s lead campaign commercial. “And it’s going to take us meat-eaters to solve them.” The solution, the ad suggests with tongue firmly planted against cheek, is to eat more meat — plant-based meat. One study suggests that plant-based meats have, on average, 50 percent lower environmental impacts than proteins raised with traditional animal agriculture. At age 40, Chestnut may be the ideal person to lead carnivores to a plant-based diet, at least some of the time. He’s ranked No. 1 in the world among competitive eaters. He holds 55 world records. Chestnut, along with his former rival Kobayashi, who had retired, has transformed a competition widely seen as a form of gluttony into a sport demanding discipline and training. (Chestnut has also probably shaved many months off his life.) But that mission — if it is indeed his mission — has cost Chestnut the chance to compete in the world’s most famous eating contest — at least for now. Major League Eating had agreed to let Chestnut compete in a rival hot-dog eating contest on Labor Day — one with “unbranded” dogs, Shea said. It was a sign the governing body wasn’t trying to restrict Chestnut’s opportunities, he added. That Sept. 2 contest, it turns out, is a live-steaming event on Netflix featuring just Chestnut and Kobayashi. Dubbed “Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef,” Netflix is pitching the contest as a “showdown [that] will settle a 15-year rivalry between the two competitive eaters.” And despite the new deal with Impossible Foods, Chestnut isn’t officially banned from ever appearing at the Nathan’s contest again, Shea said. “It might be a semantic issue, but to me, banning means, he’s out. We’re done. We’re done with Joey. That’s not the case. We love Joey. If he could resolve this issue of representing a rival brand, we’d love to have him on the Fourth. We’d love to have him next year,” Shea said. This wouldn’t be the first time that Major League Eating has had a contract dispute with one of its prized competitors. Kobayashi stopped appearing at the annual Nathan’s contest after he refused to sign a contract with MLE. Kobayashi felt the terms of the contract were too restrictive, preventing him from competing in contests not under the MLE banner. With Chestnut out, the leading candidate to win at Nathan’s this year is Geoffrey Esper, currently ranked No. 2 in the world among competitive eaters. Esper finished second last year, devouring 49 dogs in 10 minutes, 13 less than Chestnut."
2,Washington Post,Private Museum Employees Vote To Unionize After Pressure From Owners,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/06/07/glenstone-museum-union/,"There’s a wave of unionizing among museum employees, and “Glenstone is a relative newcomer. The museum opened in 2006 as a private center for the art collection of the Raleses, who live across a pond from the museum’s galleries.” – Washington Post",2024-06-10T11:00:00Z,"Employees at Glenstone, the private contemporary art museum in Potomac, Md., voted on Thursday and Friday to form a union with the Teamsters for hourly workers. The final vote came late Friday evening, following pressure from the museum’s billionaire founders Mitchell and Emily Wei Rales to oppose the move. Now the group of 89 eligible hourly-wage workers — among them guides and cafe employees as well as grounds, maintenance and housekeeping staff — will join Teamsters Local 639 and begin the bargaining process with museum management. “We have said from the beginning of this process that we respect the right of our associates to decide whether to join a union,” the museum said in a statement. “We accept the results of this election and intend to negotiate in good faith with the goal of achieving an equitable contract for the members of this new bargaining unit.” With the vote, Glenstone joins a host of art museums whose employees have formed unions over the past few years. According to a labor group called Museums Moving Forward, nearly three-quarters of all unionized private nonprofit art museums launched their campaigns in 2019 or later. “These workers defeated a sophisticated union-busting assault personally waged by some of the wealthiest people in America,” Local 639 President Bill Davis said in a statement. “I want to welcome them to our local union, and I look forward to helping them negotiate a first Teamsters contract.” Among peer institutions that have seen successful labor drives, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and Guggenheim Museum in New York, Glenstone is a relative newcomer. The museum opened in 2006 as a private center for the art collection of the Raleses, who live across a pond from the museum’s galleries. In 2015, it was one of several private museums whose tax-exempt status came under congressional scrutiny, led by then-Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). A 2018 expansion brought in a wider audience. Elizabeth Shaw, a union organizer who works as a grounds and visitor experience liaison, said the group is ready to put aside weeks of “animosity and hurt” leading to the election as the two sides negotiate a contract. “Far more important” than negotiation, the museum said in its statement, “we recommit ourselves to working in a spirit of direct and meaningful engagement, in keeping with Glenstone’s core values, to strengthen and continually improve our community, union and non-union associates alike. Our main goal is for us to draw together and move forward as one Glenstone.” Shaw, an outspoken organizer at the museum, says that the vote is proof of the power of collective action. But she may not be around to reap the fruits of her labor. Shaw is a full-time contract employee whose term is up in September; at that time she is eligible to apply for a permanent position. Shaw hopes to support her colleagues for as long as she’s with the museum. “We have a long, difficult road ahead of us.”"
3,"Daniel Gilbert and David Ovalle, (c) 2024 , The Washington Post","After FDA setback, psychedelic drugmakers distance themselves from a pioneer",https://washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/08/psychedelic-drugs-mdma-fda-therapy/,"CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the position of Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies...",2024-06-09T22:14:37Z,"Developers of mind-bending drugs for medical use are distancing themselves from the first company to seek regulatory approval for a psychedelic compound, after its application encountered strong opposition from a government panel. A resoundingly negative vote by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday — though not binding — has diminished the chances of the sponsor, Lykos Therapeutics, winning full approval for MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, industry observers said. But biotech executives, investors and researchers said in interviews that their enthusiasm for psychedelics to treat mental health disorders remains undimmed. They are betting that a by-the-books clinical trial design run by a more conventional drugmaker will ultimately succeed. In making this case, other potential applicants described the approach by Lykos, and its nonprofit parent, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, as an outlier in its clinical trial design and execution. They said that made it a weak candidate for the first test of whether the FDA will permit such drugs to go mainstream. MAPS and Lykos combined the drug — better known by its street name, ecstasy — with psychotherapy, adding complexity to the design of an already challenging trial. Investigators didn’t collect certain lab tests or data on the potential for abuse that the FDA specifically requested. And the push has been dogged by a perception that MAPS’s evangelism for psychedelics has seeped into Lykos’s work of scientifically proving the therapy’s benefits, along with allegations of misconduct in clinical trials. Kabir Nath, chief executive of Compass Pathways, said the vote was an opportunity to “pivot away from some of the, shall we say, psychedelic baggage,” referring to misconduct allegations. Compass is developing a synthetic form of psilocybin, a chemical found in hallucinogenic mushrooms, for severe depression. After Lykos, Compass Pathways is the next closest psychedelic developer to seeking FDA approval.

Wrong. Unlike Lykos, the company is not pairing its drug with psychotherapy. It is testing a low, medium and higher dose to mask which version patients get and mitigate the risk of bias. Investors saw the advisory panel vote as potentially negative for the whole category of drugs, however. Compass saw its stock drop by 15 percent the day after the vote, before rebounding to close down 2.6 percent. Shares of Mind Medicine, which is testing a form of LSD, and Atai Life Sciences, which is investing in psilocybin and DMT, fell 10 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively. Some hope that the advisory committee’s strong recommendations against the Lykos application will provide a dose of reality to the psychedelics-as-medicine movement. The committee voted 9-2 that the Lykos trial did not prove effectiveness and 10-1 that its benefits did not outweigh the risks. “My hope is that we will start to get a more balanced and nuanced picture of the real risks and benefits of psychedelics,” said David Yaden, a psychedelics researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who has written about the psychedelics “hype bubble” driven by industry and media. “Maybe the committee hearings will help adjust some people’s understanding of the state of the evidence.” Representatives of Lykos provided a statement from chief executive Amy Emerson, in which she pledged to continue working with the FDA and acknowledged the advisory committee meeting was “unprecedented in many ways,” including reviewing an application “that combines a drug and psychological intervention.” Lykos delivered two studies to the FDA showing powerful reductions in PTSD symptoms, displaying the kind of statistical significance that is usually persuasive to regulators. Its work has won over many academics, clinicians and veterans groups, which have expressed profound disappointment with the advisory committee vote. Following that vote, Amber Capone, co-founder of Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, urged the FDA to “carefully consider the compelling testimony from PTSD sufferers who have found relief through MDMA-assisted therapy.” Discussion in the committee Tuesday quickly focused on how much to trust the positive study outcomes. One key concern was that 40 percent of the participants in the MDMA trials had previous experience with the drug, raising the prospect that such patients were predisposed to believe that it would help them and potentially biasing the results. “If you had a prior positive experience, you’re probably going to have a positive experience again,” said Ritu Baral, a TD Cowen analyst. She called the trial conduct “subpar,” referring to the lack of data on lab tests for patient safety and that Lykos did not collect information the FDA had requested on euphoric reactions that could lead to abuse. Then there was the design of the trial itself, in which patients were supposed to be blind to whether they had received actual MDMA or a placebo, but — owing to the drug’s mind-altering affect — the vast majority could tell what group they were in. That challenge was well known to the FDA and isn’t unique to psychedelics. The lack of effective blinding came up during a 2019 advisory committee for Spravato, a nasal spray derived from ketamine, but members overwhelmingly endorsed it and the FDA approved it. But for Lykos, adding therapy to the mix appeared to compound concerns for some committee members: If therapists could also tell whether trial participants received the drug, they could treat them differently and affect the results. “This is unusual. This is not something the FDA has seen before,” Srinivas Rao, chief executive of Atai Life Sciences, said of the potential for therapists to treat patients differently based on knowing what treatment group they were in. Alia Lilienstein, senior medical director for Lykos, acknowledged the complicated design in Tuesday’s meeting, saying that the company is “creating a new field of medicine.” MAPS’s founder, Rick Doblin, has pitched MDMA as a humanity-changing force for good that could reduce the world’s trauma. While many in the industry respect Doblin’s success in ushering psychedelics into serious research, some have chafed at how the organization’s evangelism has colored perceptions of their work. And not everyone involved in the clinical trials endorses such grandiose goals, said Ingmar Gorman, a psychologist and clinical investigator at a MAPS trial site. “A lot of us clinicians aren’t taking up that kind of rhetoric.” Within the psychedelic community, “many of us are feeling shocked, surprised, confused and bewildered,” said Raquel Bennett, a ketamine specialist and founder of the KRIYA Institute, questioning why concerns about trial design hadn’t been addressed before. “If FDA had concerns about any aspect of the methodology, they could have addressed it with MAPS at any point during the past several years,” she said. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an influential nonprofit, in March published a draft report on MDMA-assisted therapy that raised concerns that participants felt “pressured to report good outcomes and suppress bad outcomes.” During public comment on Tuesday, some raised allegations of misconduct, including a case of sexual abuse. Though the FDA advised the committee that it considered reports of misconduct to be unverified, some members raised it in discussing their votes. Those allegations carried weight alongside concerns about the study data and the therapy, said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a committee member who serves as a patient representative and voted against approval. “Especially when you’re talking about sexual misconduct — it seems a bit impossible to ignore,” Joniak-Grant, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in an interview. A previous version of this article misstated the position of Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. Doblin has said MDMA could help reduce the world's trauma, not eliminate it. The article has been corrected."
4,"Scott Sowers, Special to The Washington Post",The U.S. wants to crack down on payday loans. Here’s what you need to know.,https://washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/10/payday-loans-rules-states/,An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of former GOP congressman Mick Mulvaney. The article has been corrected. - - -Subscribe to The...,2024-06-13T17:18:20Z,"Following a Supreme Court ruling in May, the federal government is expected to get tougher on regulating payday lenders and other firms that offer high-interest, short-term loans. This type of lending — which often targets low-income borrowers — has long drawn fire from consumer groups on grounds that these small-dollar loans quickly balloon when they’re not repaid, accruing exorbitant fees and interest. The Supreme Court ruling resolved a challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s authority to act — meaning that the agency can come off the sidelines and get back in the game of fighting predatory lending. Here’s what you need to know if you owe money to a payday lender. The CFPB will now be able to restart its implementation of long-delayed rules to crack down on predatory lending. These regulations had first been blocked during the Trump administration and then remained mired in lawsuits, including those that led to the Supreme Court case. The CFPB has attracted controversy since it was created in July 2010, when Congress passed the Dodd-Frank overhaul as a safeguard against future financial crises. As the would-be chief regulator of payday loans, the agency became a prime target for Republicans and the financial industry and was hobbled during the Trump administration under its acting director, former GOP congressman Mick  Mulvaney. Among his actions,  Mulvaney put new cases on hold, instituted a hiring freeze and cut the agency’s budget request to zero. Stories to keep you informed New documents show unreported trips by Justice Clarence Thomas Boeing discloses new quality problem on 787 Dreamliner jets  DNA reveals surprise about the children ancient Mayans chose to sacrifice Think you’re cleaning your water bottle enough? Wrong. Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the CFPB has tried to restart work tightening controls on payday loans, but it still faces fierce industry pushback. Even though the Supreme Court clarified its status as an independently funded agency, at least 14 lawsuits are still meandering through the courts. In the absence of major change at the federal level, some states have acted on their own. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, six states and the District of Columbia now ban payday lending outright, while other states have kept it legal but instituted some protections for borrowers. It will likely take awhile before changes at the federal level kick in, but if the CFPB does succeed, some borrowers could get relief from spiraling fees and interest. The CFPB’s main objective is to restrict payday lenders’ access to their customers’ bank accounts and prevent them from withdrawing money the customers don’t have. When these lenders try to extract funds from an empty account, banks  slap on overdraft charges and deepen the cycle of debt for the borrower. Whether the agency succeeds depends largely on how it resolves the remaining legal challenges. If the CFPB prevails in the courts, the industry could face tighter regulation. The outcome of November’s election will also determine whether the CFPB could once again be neutralized by political appointees. For now, an array of lenders continue to fight the tougher rules, including ACE Cash Express, Populus Financial Group, Advance America, Advance Financial and Check ’n Go. In total, their lobbies spent roughly $5 million per year from 2021 through 2023, according to the watchdog group Open Secrets. And although they contribute predominantly to Republicans, they still have some Democratic allies. From 2023 to 2024, the top two recipients of contributions were Democrats, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.) and Jared Moskowitz (Fla.). The first recourse is to check what rules your state has, because many states require lenders to provide installment remedies for late borrowers, said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The majority of states where payday loans are legal require licensed payday lenders to offer these arrangements,” he said. Citing regulations imposed by Colorado, Hawaii, Ohio and Virginia, a 2022 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that such rules allowed lenders to still post a profit while providing credit to borrowers under greater protections. Paying off debt in smaller installments can help consumers save on fees and reduce the chance of re-borrowing on more expensive terms, cutting borrowing costs by as much as fourfold compared with requiring one lump-sum payment, the Pew report said. In many of the states where payday lending remains legal, lawmakers have passed regulations that govern principal amounts, interest rates, fees, rollover terms and alternative repayment plans. In Virginia, for example, a borrower has a minimum of four months to pay off the loan, while annual interest is capped at 36 percent and late charges at $20, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other examples of state-level regulations include limits on rollovers, guidelines on when repayment plans can kick in and credit counseling requirements, Rust said. States have also imposed restrictions on the maximum loan amount, with many setting an upper limit at or around $500. There are exceptions, however: In California and Montana, the most you can borrow is $300. At the other end of the scale is Oregon, which has a maximum of $50,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other state regulations impose limits on the term of the loan, which vary widely. In Alaska, it’s 14 days, while it’s up to 60 days in Delaware and 90 days in Wisconsin.

5,,WNBA's Next Media Rights Deal Could More Than Triple To $200M Per Season,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/11/wnba-tv-deal-nba/,"The WNBA could triple its media rights fees to $200 million per season. The current package is valued at approximately $60 million and expires next season.
The NBA owns approximately 60 percent of the WNBA and is negotiating that deal alongside its more than …",2024-06-15T01:49:28Z,"The good news for the WNBA can’t stop. The league’s TV ratings are setting records seemingly every night. Players, long shunted to the background of popular sports culture, have shoe deals and starring roles in commercials. Caitlin Clark is the most-talked-about athlete in America (for better or worse, but mostly better). And there’s more to come. The league is set to receive a windfall for its broadcast rights, which expire next season and are valued at around $60 million per year, according to people familiar with the figures. The NBA, which owns roughly 60 percent of the women’s league, is in the process of negotiating that deal, which Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported will be worth more than $7 billion per year for both leagues, up from the roughly $2.7 billion the NBA gets per year in its current deal. The WNBA’s share could be transformative, with several media executives predicting the league could triple its annual rights revenue to somewhere between $180 million and $200 million or more. But there’s a quirk: Media companies won’t decide how much the WNBA’s media rights are worth. The NBA will. The NBA is soliciting one total bid from media companies that does not separate the values of the NBA and the WNBA rights, according to people familiar with the process, and some media companies involved in the bidding are not assigning a specific figure to the WNBA rights. That means the NBA’s massive deal could be rocket fuel for the WNBA — or that the WNBA’s increased popularity is more of an afterthought. It also could be a bit of both. “If you’re not getting a number from the media companies, then you are hanging on to the NBA,” said Laura Gentile, an industry consultant and ESPN’s former chief marketing officer. “You’re saying it’s a rounding error in the grand scheme of business. Maybe that’s the case, but it doesn’t help the ecosystem grow. Women’s sports wants accountability; they want their growth projections to matter.” The concern is not necessarily that the NBA will undervalue the WNBA’s rights. One media executive with knowledge of the talks suggested media companies recognize the increasing value of the WNBA regardless of whether they ascribe a specific figure to its rights. But some wonder what that strategy potentially says about the league’s future growth. “Even if the money is less, I would rather have independent money,” said David Samson, the former president of MLB’s Miami Marlins and host of the “Nothing Personal” podcast, “because then you have a real business. … If a media company says we value the WNBA at X, that’s a real value of what the WNBA’s rights are. Otherwise, it’s like buying social media followers: perceived value but not real.” In interviews, several WNBA executives said they did not share those concerns. As long as the money arrives, they said, it’s not important how it gets there. And regardless of the accounting, there are other reasons the leagues should partner, many of those people said. The leagues share resources and cross-promote, and the NBA can leverage its larger fan base to demand more exposure, better time slots and other support for the WNBA. “It’s a huge advantage to us to go to market with the NBA,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told The Washington Post. “Especially with streaming services who rely on a 12-month subscription model. If we’re only there for 4½ months … how attractive is that? But we and the NBA are maybe the only sports properties that can give 330 days of live programming — almost the entire year. That’s hugely valuable to a subscription platform.” Added William Mao, senior vice president in the media rights consulting division at the Octagon agency: “There is value to the leagues and the media companies to have this overall halo effect around pro basketball.” He added that he expected the WNBA would “get the same multiple” of its current deal whether negotiating alone or with the NBA. Independent of the media deals, the new burst of attention has plenty of stakeholders around the WNBA hoping to make sure its governing and business structures are ready to capitalize. Some of that has to do with how much to lean on the NBA, the benefits of which can be obvious. Joe Lacob, owner of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, recently paid a $50 million expansion fee to secure the rights to a Bay Area WNBA team, which has used the Warriors’ existing infrastructure to launch. The Golden State Valkyries, a reference to a female warrior of Norse mythology, start play next season. That investment is also crucial when WNBA revenue still lags far behind that of other American sports leagues. It was between $180 million and $200 million, Bloomberg reported last year — a fraction of the more than $10 billion the NBA earns. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in 2018 that the WNBA had lost an average of more than $10 million per year since its founding, which means the NBA has invested hundreds of millions in the league since its inception. This year, the WNBA and its teams still are expected to lose around $50 million, according to two people with knowledge of the figures, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the league’s finances. “The truth is, this league would be hard-pressed to exist without the NBA,” said one WNBA team executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the executive wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the league’s finances. What remains confusing, even to some around the league, is how the ownership structure of the WNBA works. The NBA’s stake in the league includes its original investment in 1996, in addition to the owners who jointly own NBA and WNBA franchises. It also includes an additional percentage from a $75 million capital raise in 2022 by the WNBA — investors included Nike, some NBA team owners and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. The amount of equity the WNBA sold, which not all league owners supported, was around 15 percent, people familiar with the figures said. That suggests the league was valued at around $500 million. (Teams were not included in the valuation. The money, Engelbert said at the time, was used for player marketing and fan engagement.) Now, the league is in line for more cash infusions in addition to the media rights deal. Toronto is also set to get an expansion team, and another city — possibly Portland, Ore. — could soon follow, with each new team paying the league a hefty expansion fee. Engelbert has said she wants the league to have 16 teams. Multiple people connected to the WNBA, however, cautioned that only around 40 percent of WNBA revenue actually reaches the league’s teams and players. The NBA gets around 40 percent, and the outside investors get a percentage, too. That, the people said, affects franchise valuations and the financial windfall from the new TV deal. (That’s a different setup from the NBA, where revenue is distributed equally among its 30 teams. The disbursements in both leagues come after league office expenses are covered.) The WNBA currently has a salary cap of around $1.4 million for each team, which puts the average salary for each player at a little more than $100,000. Also hanging over the league: the expectation that the players will opt out of the collective bargaining agreement next year. In the past, the players have been frustrated by what they view as a lack of transparency about the league’s finances. Another lingering question in WNBA circles is how league decisions are made. When Engelbert announced the league would pay for charter flights ahead of this season, plenty were pleased but didn’t understand what had changed or who ultimately signed off on the expense, which Engelbert said would cost $25 million per year for the 12 teams. Others around the league believed it was Engelbert’s call. The same questions arise around expansion, with some around the league unsure who approves expansion groups: the WNBA or the NBA. Engelbert reports to Silver, and the marketing and communications departments for the WNBA report to the NBA as well. (A WNBA spokesman referred all questions for this story to the NBA. An NBA spokesman declined to comment.) The point, these people said, wasn’t that the relationship doesn’t work but that building an infrastructure to support the WNBA’s growth remains critical. The WNBA has taken some of those steps, such as appointing a chief growth officer. Ultimately, the WNBA’s growth is plain to see. And person after person who spoke with The Post had another prediction: The WNBA is likely to have its own media rights deals whenever they are next negotiated.

6,washington post,U.S. military plans 'Hellscape' to deter China from attacking Taiwan...,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/10/taiwan-china-hellscape-military-plan/,But a top U.S. military commander for Asia says time is running out to put the plan in place.,2024-06-10T15:00:03Z,"SINGAPORE — President Xi Jinping has called on China’s People’s Liberation Army to be ready to take Taiwan by force by 2027. The United States, together with regional partners, must ensure a Chinese invasion can’t succeed. That plan hinges on quickly building and deploying thousands of new drones that would swarm the Taiwan Strait and keep China’s military busy until more help can arrive, according to the top U.S. military official in the Pacific. But time is running out to turn these plans into a reality. Under its long-standing policy of “strategic ambiguity,” the United States has never committed to coming to Taiwan’s defense if China attacks. President Biden has repeatedly said he would send the U.S. military to defend Taiwan, although he added a new caveat in his latest interview with Time, saying, “It would depend on the circumstances.” President Donald  Trump seems less likely to intervene on Taiwan’s behalf, having told a GOP senator while in office that if China attacks, “there isn’t a f------ thing we can do about it.” For any U.S. president, to send American men and women to defend a small democracy on the other side of the world would be a very tough call. That’s why Plan A is to deter Xi from ever attempting an invasion, by making sure that he never looks across the Taiwan Strait and sees an easy victory, Adm. Samuel Paparo, the new head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told me in an interview. “They want to offer the world a short, sharp war so that it is a fait accompli before the world can get their act together,” Paparo told me on the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “My job is to ensure that between now and 2027 and beyond, the U.S. military and the allies are capable of prevailing.” China’s likely strategy is to overwhelm Taiwan with a massive attack with little warning, Paparo said. Xi doesn’t want to repeat Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mistake in Ukraine in 2022, when Russia’s initial full-scale invasion failed and devolved into a long war of attrition. The key to thwarting Xi’s assumed strategy is a U.S. strategy called “Hellscape,” Paparo told me. The idea is that as soon as China’s invasion fleet begins moving across the 100-mile waterway that separates China and Taiwan, the U.S. military would deploy thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships and aerial drones to flood the area and give Taiwanese, U.S. and partner forces time to mount a full response. “I want to turn the Taiwan Strait into an unmanned hellscape using a number of classified capabilities,” Paparo said. “So that I can make their lives utterly miserable for a month, which buys me the time for the rest of everything.” “I can’t tell you what’s in it,” he replied when pressed about details. “But it’s real and it’s deliverable.” There are some public signs the Hellscape plan is making progress. In March, the Defense Department announced it would spend $1 billion on a program called “Replicator” to build swarms of unmanned surface ships and aerial drones for this very mission. Paparo said the Replicator program shows that the United States is also learning lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, where Ukraine has innovated with drone technology. The timeline for delivery of these systems is unclear. If the drone swarms aren’t ready when the attack comes, that could raise the prospects of a protracted conflict that would incur heavy losses for U.S. Naval and Air Force assets and would likely expand to include allies such as Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, according to most war game exercises conducted at U.S. think tanks. Even if “Hellscape” comes together in time, drone swarms alone will not match Beijing’s massive military buildup on its side of the Strait. The PLA is expanding its nuclear, naval, air force, cyber, intelligence and electronic warfare capabilities at record speeds. According to Paparo, China’s military budget is likely three times what Beijing publicly claims, which would put it at about $700 billion annually. Meanwhile, Indo-Pacific Command’s budget is short $11 billion of what it needs this year alone, according to a letter sent to Congress in March by Paparo’s predecessor. Financing the defense plan is not the only problem. The U.S. military currently has no reliable way to stop China’s hypersonic “carrier killer” cruise missiles. U.S. space assets are also vulnerable to Chinese attack. U.S. military deliveries to Taiwan are way behind schedule. Japanese officials told me the Biden administration is dragging its feet on Tokyo’s request to establish a new joint task force to help prepare for a conflict over Taiwan or in the South China Sea, where China is also getting more aggressive. Also complicating planning is that a full-scale invasion isn’t Xi’s only option. China might stop short of attacking and simply blockade the island, as it seemed to practice last month after Taiwan inaugurated President Lai Ching-te, who is also referred to as William Lai. Beijing is also using economic coercion, political interference and disinformation to pressure the Taiwanese people into reunification and mess with their minds. Countering these threats falls outside of Indo-Pacific Command’s remit. As a military official, Paparo has no official role in international diplomacy, but he does have strong opinions on what he calls China’s “revanchist, revisionist and expansionist” government. He believes that four decades of the West trying to convince China to liberalize politically has failed, giving way to a new, more dangerous era for Asia. “The region has got two choices. The first is that they can submit, and as an end result give up some of their freedoms … or they can arm to the teeth,” he told me. “Both cases have direct implications to the security, the freedom and the well-being of the citizens of the United States of America.” Paparo is right. Nobody thinks an arms race in Asia is an ideal outcome. But if Beijing insists on an arms race, the U.S. and its partners can’t afford to lose it. As George Washington said, “To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.” Absent more action by Washington, Xi may soon conclude Taiwan is his for the taking."
7,washington post,Red states strike deals to show controversial conservative videos in schools...,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/06/13/prageru-conservative-education-videos/,Educational material from PragerU is now offered to public schools in six states. Opponents call it indoctrination and inaccurate.,2024-06-13T13:00:03Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. A privately funded effort to use disputed videos to teach conservative values in public schools is gaining traction, as Louisiana recently became the sixth state to endorse educational materials produced by Prager University. PragerU is not a university but a nonprofit that produces short videos that push patriotism and conservative views of history, race, sex and gender, among other topics. Since last year, Florida, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Montana and Arizona have also announced partnerships with PragerU under which the nonprofit’s lessons become state-sanctioned, optional teaching materials for public schools. PragerU is neither paying nor receiving money from state partners, the nonprofit and state officials said. The company and its supporters hail the moves as countering what they call left-leaning ideas in education. The half-dozen partner states, said PragerU Chief Executive Marissa Streit, are just the beginning. “We are pursuing every state in America,” she said. Opponents say materials produced by PragerU amount to right-wing indoctrination. “PragerU’s materials are hyperpartisan to the point of propaganda, inaccurate and incredibly substandard,” said Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, a statewide teachers group. Arizona launched a PragerU partnership in January. PragerU, founded in 2009 by conservative talk show host Dennis Prager and screenwriter Allen Estrin, began by producing videos aimed at college students and expanded its offerings in 2021 to reach younger students. Its website says its goal is to counter “the dominant left-wing ideology in culture, media, and education” by promoting “American values.” Two of the most-watched videos on the “PragerU Kids” YouTube channel are a lesson on “Student Loans 101” and a cartoon-style retelling of the biblical story of David and Goliath that instructs children, “when God is on your side, you have nothing to fear.” Some of PragerU’s videos have drawn criticism for factual inaccuracies, especially for a fictionalized animated clip that portrays famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass defending the nation’s Founding Fathers’ support of slavery. Streit disputes that PragerU’s materials are inaccurate. She said the nonprofit is providing a patriotic viewpoint missing from public schools nationwide. “American students are basically given a very one-sided perspective of American history and civics,” Streit said. “We don’t teach that America is perfect. But we teach that America is the greatest experiment on planet Earth.” Supporters of the PragerU partnerships note that teachers are not being required to deploy the materials. They say the introduction of PragerU to public school classrooms is a much-needed course correction after years in which schools adopted implicitly or explicitly left-leaning lessons based on materials like the New York Times’s 1619 Project, which positions slavery at the heart of the nation’s founding. In Oklahoma, which debuted a PragerU partnership in September, state Superintendent Ryan Walters framed the need for the nonprofit’s videos in overtly political terms. “There is no better example of a curriculum that rips the soul out of the liberal takeover of our schools than providing PragerU to every Oklahoma student,” Walters said in an emailed statement. In Louisiana, which approved the PragerU materials last month, Superintendent Cade Brumley said the nonprofit’s videos represent an important optional addition to the state’s new “Freedom Framework” social studies standards. The standards, adopted in 2022, are “based in American exceptionalism and our ongoing quest for a more perfect union,” Brumley said in a statement. “Students should understand and appreciate their role in sustaining and improving our constitutional republic” — and the PragerU videos “could be very helpful,” he said. The PragerU partnerships are among the latest attempts by state officials to shape what school districts teach about hot-button topics. After the coronavirus pandemic prompted widespread remote learning, many conservatives began complaining that instruction was left-leaning, spurring lawmakers in mostly red states to pass more than 70 laws restricting what teachers can say about race, racism, history, sexual orientation and gender identity, a Washington Post analysis found. PragerU’s reach and funding exploded alongside these political battles over education. Today, the nonprofit counts more than 11.3 million followers across its social media profiles on sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X, according to a Post tally. PragerU’s website says it draws 5 million views each day. Its revenue catapulted from $36 million in 2020 to $68.7 million in 2023, tax records show. Streit, the CEO, said the nonprofit is funded by about 350,000 donors from a variety of backgrounds “who give a wide range of amounts.” She declined to name or confirm donors, but previous major givers — each donating more than a million dollars — have included the conservative Bradley Foundation, the National Christian Foundation and Texas fracking billionaires Farris and Dan Wilks, according to the Guardian and SourceWatch.org. It is unclear how frequently PragerU materials will be used. In states that have debuted collaborations with PragerU, education officials contacted by The Post either did not respond to questions or said they are not tracking how many school districts have implemented PragerU content. It is likely that decisions on whether to use PragerU materials will come down to the views of individual teachers, and that nobody will track how many educators show the videos. “My guess is it will be a lot of political sound and fury, signifying very little educationally,” said Jonathan Zimmerman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies the history of education. A spokesman for the Louisiana Education Department noted that “supplemental resources and curriculum are local decisions,” adding that the department does not gather data from school districts on what supplemental materials they choose to use. Education association heads in Montana and Arizona said they are unaware of any school districts formally choosing to use PragerU materials since their states opened partnerships with the nonprofit — and that it would be difficult to determine. “We have over 400 school districts in Montana — each with their own school board and administration,” said Rob Watson, executive director of the School Administrators of Montana. “There could be at least one of those districts that have adopted PragerU, [but] I do not know of any who have.” In Florida, which became the first state to partner with PragerU nearly a year ago, at least five school districts reportedly instructed their staffs not to use the videos. In most cases, the Florida districts cited policies requiring that all supplemental materials be approved by local school officials first. In Oklahoma, at least eight school districts have also declined to use PragerU materials for the same reason. PragerU lessons cover topics from “government-run health care” to the U.S. Constitution to how to open and maintain a savings account. Under the PragerU partnership with New Hampshire, launched in September, state officials approved a PragerU online financial literacy course for use in public schools. The nonprofit’s online material is free for teachers to use and available to the public through YouTube and its website. Its books and workbooks are also free online, although hard copies of some magazines and workbooks must be purchased, Streit said. PragerU also publishes free guides meant to help teachers figure out how best to deploy its content. In Louisiana, for instance, PragerU created a nearly 100-page document, available online, that matches its videos to state standards. Critics say PragerU lessons distort history and facts to serve a conservative worldview. Some scientists have said PragerU videos lack context and downplay climate change as climate alarmism, while the Council on American-Islamic Relations alleges some videos are anti-Muslim. Other complaints center on the nonprofit’s portrayal of slavery. In many PragerU videos that deal with the topic, various historical figures assert that people in the 21st century should not view those in the past by the light of modern-day values. For instance, one animated video depicts Christopher Columbus speaking with two children from the 21st century. Defending the practice of slavery, he says “slavery is as old as time” and asks: “How can you come here to the 15th century and judge me by your standards? … You must ask yourself, ‘What did the culture and society at the time treat as no big deal?’” The clip is one of several videos in which speakers describe slavery as an accepted practice in its time. PragerU videos also emphasize that White people worked to abolish slavery, while minimizing the fact that other White people were working to continue it. In the video featuring Douglass, an animated version of the famed abolitionist says the nation’s Founding Fathers forged compromises on slavery because they were trying to unify the nation. The video mentions that some Founding Fathers owned enslaved people and says they knew slavery was “evil and wrong” but prioritized compromise and unifying the colonies. But Douglass was better known for his strident opposition to compromises over slavery in the 1840s and ’50s, when the video is set, and the video conflates events of very different time periods, experts say. “There’s a constant effort to spin atrocities in the past as not so bad,” said Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University, who has examined many of the company’s videos. When Adrienne McCarthy, a researcher at Kansas State University, published an analysis of PragerU’s college-level materials in 2022, she found prominent themes included small government, opposition to the welfare state and pushback against movements such as Black Lives Matter. She concluded PragerU “mimics much of the extreme right-wing ideology in a way that is more readily digestible.” Asked about criticism of PragerU’s offerings including the Douglass video, Streit said that whether people agree with PragerU’s portrayal of Douglass, “no one can fairly argue that PragerU denies the horrors of slavery.” Generally, Streit said, the nonprofit is simply providing a counterbalance and offering a perspective that differs from what PragerU alleges children are hearing 90 percent of the time in school. “Isn’t that what America is about?” she said. “We are not claiming people should only use PragerU.”"

That’s not too unusual for June but this year they’ve been hard to come by. That’s on its way toward changing and today was just a small preview. Tomorrow offers a clearer picture of what’s ahead — even then it may be a bit tame. A cold front headed this way promises that this pulse of high heat will be short lived.

Clearer into tonight, but only down into the upper 60s and low 70s for lows. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Friday): Feeling like summer. Lots of morning and midday sun help temperatures reach the low 90s most spots, with some mid-90s possible in the typically hotter locations. Showers and storms may crash the party late afternoon or evening. Depending on when they arrive, there is potential for a few to be strong or severe. See David Streit’s forecast through the weekend.

Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options Through Tonight: Showers and storms work this way from the north and west during the evening. While a storm or two could turn intense, with a small risk for isolated wind damage, most of the severe weather should stay to our north. An isolated storm is possible early evening, but odds of rain are better near and after sunset. It probably won’t be a lot in most spots. Lows will range across the 60s. Drier air begins to noticeably move in during the pre-dawn. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Saturday): Near wall-to-wall sun greets the day. It should stay that way throughout. Temperatures mainly reach the mid-80s for highs. Winds blowing from the north around 5 to 10 mph keep humidity at bay. Sunday: Mostly sunny skies prevail, with maybe a few more clouds than Saturday. Again, we’re looking at mostly mid-80s for highs, but some upper 80s might trickle in.

Well above-average heat and an approaching cold front may collaborate on some thunderstorms later in the day, a couple of which could turn severe. We’ll see a good deal of morning and midday sunshine. That gives way to a chance of scattered showers and storms popping up this afternoon and tonight. While many will see some rain, it shouldn’t be a whole lot, and other locations may stay dry. A few storms could turn strong to severe, with primarily an isolated damaging wind gust risk. After today — a great weekend! Then temperatures and humidity climb as we face a long heat wave next week and say goodbye to spring. Get our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Today (Friday): Storms are possible this afternoon, but odds ramp up toward early evening. The main severe storm threat is from damaging wind gusts over 57 mph. Perhaps a little bit of hail. Widespread damage is not expected, by any means. Summerlike high temperatures around 90 degrees to mid-90s feel a bit hotter thanks to moderate humidity (dew points well into the 60s). Enjoy the calmer, sunnier morning hours. Confidence: Medium-High Tonight: As this troublemaking cold front continues to pass through the region, showers and storms remain possible.

Confidence: Medium-High Tomorrow night: Temperatures bottom out near 60 to mid-60s around sunrise. Perhaps a windows-open night with dew points still hanging out in the comfortable 50s. Skies should hold just a few high clouds, at most. Confidence: Medium-High Sunday: It should be a great Father’s Day with just a few clouds at times — mainly bright and sunny. Any breezes should stay a bit lower than Saturday. Temperatures may end up a degree or two warmer than Saturday. Still within a few degrees of 85 for most of the region. Comfort remains for one last day, soak up dew points in the 50s. Confidence: Medium-High Sunday night: Low temperatures should bottom out in the increasingly humid feeling 60s. Perhaps our last night below 70 degrees for a while? A tiny rain chance, and we’ll update you as we get closer if any overnight showers or storms become likely. Confidence: Medium Summer may catapult back on Monday with high temperatures near 90 to perhaps as hot as the mid-90s. Strong June sunshine likely beats down on us as humidity rises a into less-comfortable levels (dew points above 60). There should be a breeze at times, hopefully. A quick shower or storm can’t be ruled out. Confidence: Medium Possibly the “brutal” start of the heatwave Tuesday with some chance that combined heat and humidity results in heat indices above 100. Thermometer readings top out in the low-to-mid 90s with moderately humid dew points in the 60s.

A couple may turn severe, with locally damaging winds and hail. Storms remain possible Friday evening, as a cold front takes its time moving through the region. Thunderstorm intensity and coverage area should fade pretty quickly by late evening. Temperatures cool a little into the low-to-mid 60s. Confidence: Medium Still warm but more comfortable weekend weather comes behind the strong Friday cold front. While a tiny chance of a stray shower and just a few clouds are around, it’s the dry, comfortable air with high temperatures in the mid- to upper 80s that should win you over.

20,Ian Livingston,"D.C. faces hottest weather so far this year Friday, and just wait until next week",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/11/dc-extreme-heat-wave-forecast/,An extended period of extreme heat is possible and even the chance to hit 100 for the first time since 2016.,2024-06-11T16:14:35Z,"This spring has been warmer than normal in the D.C. area, but we’ve largely avoided big heat. Not since a record hot day in early May have highs reached 90 degrees. That’s about to change and potentially in a big way. We should be back to 90 degrees Thursday. Then we could top 95 degrees Friday, the highest so far this year. But those two days may only be an appetizer. Next week looks brutally hot, and the District could hit 100 degrees for the first time since 2016. It could also mark the beginning of a prolonged period of unseasonably hot weather similar to what we’ve experienced in some of our more brutal summers. Once we hit mid-June, stretches of comfortable weather last only so long in the D.C. area, especially in this era of human-caused climate change. Enjoy the rather mild weather we’re experiencing early this week while it lasts. The National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center is highlighting the potential for excessive heat along much of the Interstate 95 corridor from Richmond to Boston next week, starting around Tuesday and continuing through at least June 24. A blend of numerous computer model projections shows the pair of 90 degree days Thursday and Friday this week, and then an extended stretch of highs in the mid-90s starting next week. These projections could be conservative. Some of the more reliable individual computer models are forecasting highs near and above 100 by the middle of next week — although they sometimes overestimate the magnitude of the heat. For the burst of heat this Thursday and Friday, humidity will rise but shouldn’t reach oppressive levels. But that might not be the case next week. The weather pattern may pump in not only heat but also very high levels of humidity. Heat indexes — a measure of how hot it feels factoring in humidity — could approach or even surpass 105. That would trigger heat advisories or even excessive-heat warnings for the area. Models project that the heat dome poised to build over the Washington region will reach an intensity that has been associated with highs of around 100 degrees in the past. In the second half of June, such highs reach record territory. Heat this extreme would pose risks for vulnerable groups such as outdoor workers, the homeless, older adults and anyone without adequate ways of staying cool and hydrated. Overnight low temperatures will probably also remain very warm, exacerbating risks for anyone without access to air conditioning. Once next week’s heat wave begins, there’s no obvious end to it in model forecasts. Projections beyond next week show a continuation of hotter-than-normal weather for much of the Lower 48 states. The summer of 2016, the last one to feature triple-digit highs in D.C., started off with relatively pleasant weather and only one 90 degree day as of this date — similar to this year. It end up ranking as the third-hottest on record. Like this year, it also followed an El Niño winter. Highs reached at least 90 degrees on 58 days, including on the highest number of days on record between July and August. It hit at least 100 on four days, once in late July and three times in mid-August. Our own Capital Weather Gang summer outlook identified 2016 as a summer that may share characteristics with this one. Jason Samenow contributed to this report."

22,Ian Livingston,"With extreme heat set to roar in, we declare spring over in the D.C. area",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/13/dc-heat-wave-records-md-va/,We’re likely to begin a prolonged stretch of 90-degree weather next week.,2024-06-13T15:23:20Z,"So far, it has been a relatively pleasant warm season in Washington. Despite above-average temperatures, only one day has reached 90 degrees. But spring weather is out and summer weather is charging in. We declare spring over and summer here. Highs near or above 90 are expected through Friday. Next week, we need to brace for a lengthy spell of punishing heat with highs in the 90s that could threaten records as soon as Monday. It will get hotter as the week wears on, with highs in the upper 90s or low 100s not out of the question during the second half. If some of the more aggressive model forecasts are accurate, it could be the hottest week in at least eight years. The heat will mark the onset of true summer conditions in the region and a sudden change from a comfortably warm spring. Despite a lot of rainy weekends, the weather was frequently favorable for outdoor fun as the landscape burst to life. Thursday’s highs could clip 90 in the area, although some spots may only top out in the upper 80s; that’s still above the norm of 85. Friday is more of a sure thing to reach at least 90, and some spots could hit 95, the hottest so far this year. A cool front coming in late Friday will bring some weekend relief. Humidity levels will drop and highs both days are probably in the mid- to upper 80s. Instead of rain so common in recent weekends, sunshine will rule. By Monday, afternoon highs rebound into the low or even mid-90s with a smattering of record highs possible. Tuesday and Wednesday appear to be headed for the mid-90s, bringing the chance of more records. The worst of the heat will probably arrive late next workweek and continue into the weekend and even beyond. That’s when highs could reach at least the mid- to upper 90s. And while humidity levels may start off modest, they will rise as next week progresses. By later next week, a wide swath of the area may see heat indexes — a measure of how hot it feels factoring in the humidity — of at least 105 degrees. That will probably trigger heat advisories or even excessive heat warnings if heat indexes flirt with 110. So far this year, we’ve actually seen a below average number of hot days. We’ve posted only one 90-degree day so far, three below the norm. Not since 2005 has there been only one as of this date. But we’re expecting to make up for lost time. We could easily pick up 10 or more in the back half of this month, which ranks among the top-five most. We’re also likely to begin racking up the count of 95-degree days. On average, we don’t post our first 95 until June 19, but have a strong chance to do so next week, if not Friday this week. The European modeling system projects highs could reach at least 95 every day between June 20 and 27. A streak that long would be significant historically, ranking among the top 10. Even nonconsecutively, the record for the most 95-degree days in June is just seven, set in 2010 and 1991. It’s not out of the question highs reach 100 some time during the second half of next week for the first time in any month since 2016 and the first time in June since 2012. It reached 100-plus at least once in June 2010, 2011 and 2012. We consider the start of summer in Washington when the forecast calls for most days to reach at least the 80s. Like our declaration for the end of winter this year, we may have been somewhat tardy in our call for spring’s closing. To our credit, there have been no 90s since a record high in early May and Tuesday’s high was only 76. This year’s declaration of the end of spring ties for the latest we’ve made this call over the past decade. On average, we’ve done so around late May. By this time next week, it should be increasingly apparent that a long spring does not foreshadow a tame summer."
23,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: Teen brother moved in for his safety but puts their budget at risk,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/07/carolyn-hax-teen-brother-moves-in-food/,A young adult brother is living with them to escape his dad’s abuse — with painful consequences for their food supply.,2024-06-07T04:00:00Z,"Dear Carolyn: Last year, my husband and I took in my younger brother, 19. After our mom died two years ago, his dad became emotionally and physically abusive to him. I noticed some bruises on him, and when he told me what was going on, I said he should come stay with us. He’s been with us about six months and is now going to community college part time and working part time. He’s a good kid except for what he wants to eat. It’s not only unhealthy, which worries me, it’s expensive. He won’t eat most vegetables, definitely nothing green, no beans or lentils, no potatoes except fries or chips, no cheese except on pizza, no milk or yogurt, only white bread, rolls/buns. Nothing homemade (bread, cookies, cakes, etc.). No fruit except cut-up apples with peanut butter. This leaves few options for dinner, no affordable ones, and it’s starting to bust our food budget. My husband gets annoyed when my brother’s eating hamburgers and we’re having chili stretched out with a lot of beans and rice. Or last night, we had chicken legs and he ate nothing but the chicken so ate more of them than me and my husband together. I don’t blame my husband for being a little put out, since my brother’s board barely covers the extra utilities. He does pay for his own lunch supplies. Asking him to leave is out of the question; he’s still recovering from the trauma his dad laid on him. What can I do? — Going Broke Going Broke: I wouldn’t even consider his moving out as an option, just to be clear. What you’re doing is right and necessary and pretty great. The food issue is unfortunate, of course. But it’s also a chance to do even more to help your brother. He is old enough to be part of the solution. So please, present him both with the problem and with all the options you have available to you as a family; spread the parameters out on the table, basically, and say, “Okay, we’re feeding for three but spending for four, so let’s crack this together.” (I will never not think of the air-filter scene in “Apollo 13” when it comes to group problem-solving like this.) The pieces are: one budget, three appetites, three adults capable of shopping for and preparing food, and three different palates. Right? So find out what each of you is able to contribute — be it Googling recipes or tracking grocery bargains — and where each of you is willing to bend, to make everyone feel included, welcome and well-fed. That is the twin message you want to convey every time you deliver the budget message: welcome. He is welcome. Your brother is not only your brother, but also only 19, and traumatized. He is welcome in your home and in the discussion about running the household better. Anything within the parameters could work, from making your own pizza to cheaper and slower-cooked cuts of meat to crowdsourcing (readers, please drop suggestions in the comments) to a different part-time job that gives him access to food to — wait, why no mention of pasta? What won’t work is counting chicken legs. Or tut-tutting your brother’s nutritional deficits. Or shaming of any kind: If you think he’ll react with self-loathing, then say nothing, shop extra-frugally and be patient. The impulse to correct a young person is normal, but respectful, age- and stage-appropriate inclusion is healthier. It honors both the brave adult he already is, and the sensitive one you’re giving him room to become.

24,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: Battle with teen stepson gets physical over posting cruel photos,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/09/carolyn-hax-stepson-photos-post-altercation/,"Her stepson wouldn’t stop posting unflattering photos of her online, and things got physical when she wrested his phone away.",2024-06-09T04:00:00Z,"Dear Carolyn: I have a 14-year-old stepson, “Paul.” Paul’s dad and I have been married for eight years. Paul stays with us every other week, and I feel like we have a pretty good relationship. Last year, Paul started taking unflattering photos of me and sharing them on social media. Think post-yard-work grubby, just woke up, eating, etc. Annoying. I asked him to stop. When he didn’t, I asked my husband to talk to him. It felt really intrusive, and I hated having to be on guard when Paul was here. My husband made Paul apologize to me. The apology was along the lines of, “I’m sorry you look so bad in every picture I take.” And he didn’t stop. At this point I asked my husband to give him some consequences, but he acted like I was making too big a deal of it and if I stopped reacting, then Paul would stop. Last weekend, I was prescribed medicine that gave me a rash. I was in my bathrobe, hair a mess, hideous rash all over my face, and Paul took a photo of me. I grabbed the phone out of his hand and deleted the photo, plus other photos he had taken of me without me knowing. Paul started wrestling me to get his phone back, and hit me several times, so I threw his phone. It broke. Paul started screaming at me, and my husband came running and yelled at both of us. Paul went to his mom’s and refuses to come back here. His mom sent me nasty texts and threatened to sue me for the replacement cost of the phone. My husband is angry at me for not just “being an adult and letting it go” and demanding I apologize to Paul for breaking his phone. Lost in all of this is the fact that my stepson assaulted me (I have bruises) and no one has addressed his behavior. I am sick of all of them, and I really don’t know what to do. Apologize? Divorce? Restraining order? Help? — Paparazzi Are Inside the House Paparazzi Are Inside the House: Paul’s behavior is antisocial, cruel, defiant and dangerous. And creepy. And possibly illegal. And he’s not the biggest issue here. That distinction belongs to his parents. All the adults here have failed Paul. You let your emotions build to (a possibly illegal) outburst level, which is on you, even though your outrage is 100 percent valid. You all missed opportunities to approach Paul from a compassionate parenting angle. I’ll frame it this way: How would he feel if you all turned the sanctuary of home against him — just to publicly humiliate him? That’s what he did to you, so it would have been a good empathy exercise to ask him. And did anyone note the underlying anger in the mean photos, prodding Paul about its source? Or ask a relevant teacher/adviser/coach whether Paul’s behavior has changed? Did anyone ask Paul if he was okay? Did anyone plan some dedicated, parental, recreational one-on-one time with Paul to see if he’d open up? It appears everyone missed a cry for help. But your husband’s failure tops all, since he shares primary authority (with Paul’s mom) and has the closest view — yet did the least about it. Parents simply must act once their kids show flagrant disregard for someone’s humanity or dignity. It’s a parent’s sacred responsibility — to the kids, to the rest of their families, to society. And to themselves, since the recoil from a child’s bad acts can be as devastating to the parents as it is to the child. Your husband blew multiple opportunities to stop Paul’s progression down this path. The forced apology was the first misstep; those encourage insincerity and teach nothing besides the low price to keep doing whatever one wants. Accepting the insincerity was the second misstep. It was his dad’s job to tell Paul: “‘I’m sorry I hurt you’ is an apology. ‘I’m sorry you look bad’ is an insult.” Further defiance? Bye, phone. It’s a privilege. The third misstep was letting Paul off the hook for recidivism (bye, phone!); the fourth was, wow, blaming the victim. Does your husband think his son didn’t watch him do that, and take notes? Husband, too, needs the empathy quiz. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth missteps were: failing to confer with you about a proper, unified adult response to the incident toward your dignity and Paul’s ultimate well-being; choosing the wrong side; ignoring his son’s violence; and not saying, “Focus, please,” to his ex because an out-of-control adolescent costs way, way more than a busted phone. The mother’s behavior is a horror I won’t parse because who knows what she was told. But, wow. Assuming your husband’s disrespect wasn’t fatal to the marriage: Everything here points to professional intervention. Paul needs help. I don’t see him getting it, though, with these parents. Mercifully, you don’t need their cooperation to call or text the National Parent & Youth Helpline, 855-427-2736. It’s only a start, but it’s free, 24-7, expert guidance for you and Paul, the two most at risk in this mess.

28,Carolyn Hax,"Carolyn Hax: Abusive ex got therapy, but their son still won’t give him a chance",https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/15/carolyn-hax-son-abusive-ex-forgiveness/,"Now that abusive ex-husband has had therapy, this letter writer wonders how much to advocate on his behalf with their son.",2024-06-15T04:00:00Z,"Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: When my son, “Barry,” turned 14, my husband became emotionally abusive to him. Nothing Barry could do was good enough or right, according to his dad. I suspected this was somehow connected to my husband’s father dying by suicide when he was 14. I asked my husband to consider therapy, but he refused. His behavior got so bad, I gave him an ultimatum — get therapy or we divorce. We broke up, and Barry told me how much it meant that I stood up for him. I said I always would but he needed to understand that his dad wasn’t a bad person, but a good man who lost his way. My ex’s anger problems continued to escalate until he was fired for punching his boss. He was forced to enter therapy. Barry is now 19 and a fine young man except for the fact that he won’t give his dad another chance. My ex has done a lot of work on himself these past two-plus years and deserves enormous credit. I feel so bad for my ex and admire how he won’t give up on Barry no matter how much he is rejected. Barry gets really upset when I advocate for his dad, so I wonder if I’m doing more harm than good. Should I stay out of the way or continue to try to mediate? — Anonymous Anonymous: Oh, my goodness, yes, stop pressuring your son to forgive the man who abused him. That’s his process to go through, not yours. You may be right that your ex is “a good man who lost his way” — you’re entitled to that opinion regardless — but your son gets to have his opinion, too, and he may think his dad is a bad person. He also may be right. By pushing your narrative on him as if no other could be true, you’re negating your son — telling him his experience, his judgment, his conclusions are wrong and don’t matter. That is the exact opposite of standing up for him. When Barry thanked you for doing that back when he was 14, you actually undermined your gesture right away with your response, indicating that he “needed” to think about his abusive dad the way you told him to. I’m guessing he was too young at the time to articulate this to you, but I also don’t doubt he internalized the dissonance. Here he was thanking you for respecting and believing (in) him, and your response was to take an abusive-dad-first, not abused-kid-first perspective. I do understand your compassion, and trashing a parent is always fraught. But Barry is the one you are morally bound to protect. Even now — you “admire” your ex, and you’re wringing your hands over your son. How do you think Barry hears that? So consider also apologizing to Barry for the overreach into his emotional business. If Barry wants to hate his dad to the moon and back, then that’s Barry’s prerogative. Even if you don’t like it, even if Barry’s wrong, and even if it’s ultimately not good for him. Because Barry gets to decide now what’s good for Barry. And the best thing his parents can do for him now is respect that. I urge you to get counseling yourself, for what I guess would be called “codependency” with your ex that survived his abuse of your child and the demise of your marriage — but in I’m-not-a-therapist terms, it’s what I’d call backing the wrong damn horse.

29,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: Boyfriend’s big sister will ‘throw a fit’ if he gets engaged first,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/16/carolyn-hax-boyfriend-sister-engagement-fit/,His big sister promises to throw a fit if he gets engaged before she does. Do he and his partner proceed with their plans anyway?,2024-06-16T04:00:00Z,"Dear Carolyn: My boyfriend and I want to get engaged in the coming months, but his older sister has indicated she will throw a fit if he is engaged before she is. We plan on getting engaged anyway and agree that upsetting his sister is a risk we must take. Any tips on dealing with the inevitable fallout? — Anonymous Anonymous: First thoughts: Correct, don’t negotiate with terrorists — I mean, what if she never marries? And what is this, 1955? What does anyone gain by tacitly endorsing the idea that for an older sister, being single is a bad thing? I want to shake her (figuratively, of course) just for accepting that sexist albatross from prior generations. Some members of which I’d also like to shake, hard. Figuratively. But these don’t help. The answer here is compassion, and the words “terrorist,” “albatross” and “advice columnist responds to legacy sexism with thoughts of violence” tend not to bring that out in people. So. New thought: The older sister is going through some stuff. Her stuff has nothing to do with you, your boyfriend or your pending engagement, so maintaining your own schedule for your own reasons is the only right thing to do. But a loved one in pain does involve you, or at least it involves your boyfriend, if only to the extent that she might welcome the support of the people who love her when she feels bad about herself. So instead of going in with autonomy guns blazing, he might accomplish more by asking if she’s okay — because she is a [list of her best attributes] person who is asking something of him that is none of these things. And, meanwhile, her being paired or unpaired has zero bearing on her worth. This advice is for him, not you, sorry, but you can coach him up. Think: blunt meeting of equal minds, with no trace of condescension or pity or “there, there”-isms. She may still throw her fit, especially if that’s her signature style. But still, a loving, thoughtful bluff-call to get ahead of it — followed by patience and no further explaining if she makes good on her threat — is the best way to deal with any fallout. Congratulations in the coming months. Dear Carolyn: Our adult daughter is a heavy user of social media. While it’s not our business if she decides to post her own issues, she has in the past posted about family, occasionally in a less-than-flattering light. It’s gotten to the point that we often have to preface our conversations with her with, “This is not something to be discussed online.” When we share photos with her, we’ll indicate they are for her only. It’s not as if she’s using social media to attack us, but rather that her filters about what is appropriate for posting are pretty loose. And she tends to be impulsive. We want to be able to confide in her and keep her informed about family affairs but find ourselves often holding back. It’s not that we have a lot to hide, but we’re of a generation where some things are best left unpublicized. How do we maintain an open and honest dialogue with her while protecting our privacy? — Old Fogey Old Fogey: You’re already doing that, by telling her in advance when the information or a photograph you’re giving her is not intended for social publication. That may be annoying to you, both to do this and to feel you have to, but it is absolutely appropriate for these circumstances. If she doesn’t respect your wishes and posts it all anyway, then you call her on the breach of trust and stop sharing with her — or, if you prefer, stop reacting when she shares. It’s pretty binary stuff. Not reacting gets a lot easier, by the way, when you unfollow her. I highly recommend it. If she does respect your wishes, then what is the problem? Specifically, what is wrong with her living her way, and your living yours, and anticipating the gap? If you were my parent, asking me not to post certain things, and if I complied — and if you still indicated you wanted to do more about our social media differences, then I would begin to think it wasn’t about keeping your information private according to your preference, but instead changing me according to your preference. And that’s a line few kids of any age fail to recognize. It hums like an electrified fence. That’s why my advice is to handle your differences entirely from your side of the line — meaning, manage your information based on what you anticipate your daughter will do with it, vs. trying to manage your daughter. That will have the added benefit of handing your daughter fewer grievances against her family to complain about online.

30,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: Stay-at-home mom worries about the example she’s setting for kids,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/08/carolyn-hax-stay-at-home-mom-example/,Do kids develop harmful gender expectations when they have a stay-at-home mom and a working dad?,2024-06-08T04:00:00Z,"Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: I stopped working when I had kids. This was a decision I didn’t take lightly. I have family money of my own that I knew would allow me to support myself if anything ever happened between me and my husband. If that weren’t the case, I would have made different choices. My kids are 9 and 6 now and have a slew of questions/observations/beliefs about the fact that Dad works and Mom stays home and takes care of them. How and when do I introduce the financial calculus that went into that? The last thing I would want is for them to draw gendered, simple conclusions — which would be very easy for them to do since there are a lot of stay-at-home moms in our community. — Stay-at-Home Parent Stay-at-Home Parent: As you know, explaining things to kids, especially while they’re young, is a process of a thousand conversations, observations, explanations. One reason is they’re not always ready for a whole history or analysis of something — you feed them only the pieces they can handle. Another reason: They bring their own observations to whatever you say — like those other families, and of course they’re also observing you up close, so their understanding is an unpredictable work in progress. Another reason is that life is dynamic and the thing you’re narrating, and they’re processing, will change. So you take all of that as the answer to “When do I …” When something is important to you, refer to it, and be repetitive. “Yes, your dad works outside the home and I focus on taking care of you. We could have switched that around, but this made more sense for us.” Or, “Yes, I know you see mostly moms doing this — but dads can, too. It’s up to every family to make these decisions.” Where you slip in the enduring legacy of centuries of patriarchy is mama’s choice. This approach stakes out your position for future conversation. If they’re ready for it now, then they’ll probably follow up with, “Why?” Then you go ahead, say that choosing not to work means not having money coming in for now or for retirement, and that was okay for you because you have enough money saved. If your situation were different and involved a financial risk, then you could say that, too — that you and their dad decided one of you would stay home anyway, and you did X, Y and Z to protect yourself and the family. Kids’ eyes glaze over pretty fast if your info is over their heads, so if it is, then let it go for a while and wait for next opportunities. The fun part of this is that your kids are guaranteed to take their partial — and partially conjured — understanding to the playground and share loudly with everyone on Earth. So there’s that. But that’s inevitable, so, whatever. (Ask any first- or second-grade teacher to share things the kids blurt out.) Just build their understanding of your values with all those little daily pieces. One thing to keep in mind: You don’t want to build judging into that structure. We used a “some people do X, others Y, and we chose Z” construction for so many things, to establish there wasn’t just One Way to live. That plants the seeds for their agency, too, and can even get them thinking of people who make different choices. If they can’t find any in their orbit, then, well, there’s your next social-emotional-educational conversation prompt.

31,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: Spouse feels blindsided after overhearing husband’s therapy session,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/10/carolyn-hax-husband-therapy-overheard/,"A letter writer accidentally overheard husband’s therapy session, and can’t unhear the “really negative, hurtful things.”",2024-06-10T04:00:00Z,"Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: Earlier this week, I overheard my husband say some really negative, hurtful things about me. I thought he was on a work call but realized he was actually talking with his therapist. I was so surprised, it took me a little while to understand what I was hearing and high-tail it to another area of the house. Now I can’t unhear what he said and am not sure how to move forward. I know what I heard wasn’t meant for me and was just a snippet of a much larger conversation, but how do I move on since it’s not something I can address with him directly? We have young kids, and life is busy and stressful, but I thought we were okay, relationship-wise. Apparently not, and I’m not sure how much longer I can act like we’re fine with his words in my head. — Blindsided Blindsided: What a gut-punch, I’m sorry. I don’t agree, though, that you can’t address it with him. You may not want to, but “can’t” doesn’t apply. You were not eavesdropping and did not choose to violate his privacy. Plus, your knowing something and feeling bad about it, while he doesn’t know you know, mirrors the gut-punch you just got from him. One of you is withholding and putting on an act as it is; you don’t need both of you doing it. That’s the opposite of intimacy. So admit you accidentally caught some stray words that were hurtful to you, before you pieced it together and high-tailed it elsewhere. Then say you’re mentioning it for two reasons: You don’t want to lie to him by omission, about the overhearing or about your feelings, and you do want him to take soundproofing precautions before his next appointment. Tell him if he’s not ready, you and he don’t have to discuss the substance of what you overheard. You’re both still better off coming clean to the extent you feel able. Re: Blindsided: I was seeing a therapist to deal with frustrations in my marriage over little things that I knew did not affect the big important things, but nevertheless left me resentful. I just needed a safe space to sort the wheat from the chaff and decide what issues were worth raising with my spouse. I would have died if my spouse heard me, because these sometimes-petty frustrations did not reflect how much I love him. But I needed a place to unload it all, and with a therapist, I could just say it bluntly and unveil ugly, momentary thoughts. Hope this helps you process what you heard. — Anonymous Hi, Carolyn: I have a daughter, 27, who has a long-term boyfriend I like very much. Recently, they moved in together, and my daughter is having doubts about their future. He is a real introvert and uncomfortable in any social situation, and she describes him as emotionally unavailable. My daughter confides in me often, and I try to be supportive but not make recommendations other than that couples therapy might help. Can you suggest how I can best do this? — Not That Mom Not That Mom: Listening and giving her room to figure this out for herself is totally appropriate, as is. If you sense she wants more from you, then resist the urge to unleash the opinions — because they could marry, and your “Ugh, you can do so much better!” will become eternal. Instead, escalate to leading questions: “What answer do you wish someone would give you?” Or: “What epiphany are you waiting for?” Prompt her to make the stronger recommendations she needs.

32,Carolyn Hax,"Carolyn Hax: Now that she’s the mother-in-law, she sees no need for boundaries",https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/11/carolyn-hax-mother-in-law-no-boundaries/,She set firm boundaries with her mother-in-law but can’t understand her son and his wife’s boundaries with her.,2024-06-11T04:00:00Z,"Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: My wife put up significant boundaries with my mother right after we got married. She had good reasons. Our son and his wife have been married for several years, and have apparently put up boundaries with my wife — limiting contact, contacting her on their schedule, etc. My wife does not understand WHY. She complains incessantly to me that she does not hear from our son and daughter-in-law as often as she’d like, which would be multiple times a day. We do hear from them every week or so. I’ve said on more than one occasion that perhaps they’ve put up boundaries similar to the ones we set for my mom. My wife just won’t hear it. Any ideas? She does go to therapy. — Bearing the Brunt Bearing the Brunt: Doesn’t sound like therapy’s hitting the mark. I’m not sure your counsel is, either; connecting this to the boundaries your wife set for your mom encourages such a negative association. And it doesn’t sound justified: The kids are in touch regularly and often — well within a range of normal, at least, for people who get along just fine. Within the range of envy, even. Now, it could still be true that your son and daughter-in-law keep you at arm’s length on purpose and have negative reasons for it. You certainly know the situation better than I. But if you are on the cold side of a boundary, then there’s no better argument for your wife to Back! Off! If what she wants is a better relationship with this couple than you two had with your mom, then respect for the couple’s space is the only answer. It’s always the answer, which is why I mused that your wife’s therapy hasn’t gotten real traction. If it had, then your wife would be working from the respect-and-acceptance playbook vs. the Mobius-strip-of-need playbook. Butanyway … you have an opportunity to say to your wife that of course she’s hurt, since she has such a negative association with boundaries. She used them, though, because your mom forced her hand — while this couple is in regular, frequent, voluntary contact. So it’s an almost 100 percent possibility these are apples and oranges: You’re all in good standing, they simply prefer contact on their terms. Again, frequent terms! Yay! Right?

33,"Carolyn Hax, Haben Kelati",Dad insists on lectures that drive teens away. Hax readers give advice.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/12/carolyn-hax-lecturing-kids-dad/,Husband is so adamant about his duty to lecture their teens into adulthood that the kids are now “avoiding him completely.”,2024-06-12T19:00:00Z,"We asked readers to channel their inner Carolyn Hax and answer this question. Some of the best responses are below. Dear Carolyn: My husband and I have two teens. They’re great kids with good heads on their shoulders (so far!). My husband has taken to giving them long-winded unsolicited advice, and the kids have gone from politely listening to glazing over to now directly telling him they aren’t looking for advice to getting mad when he persists to avoiding him completely. He gets mad and says he’s obligated as a parent to provide “guidance,” and if the kids need to get mad at him in order to be “motivated,” then he’s fine with that. I only give advice to the kids when asked or when they are thinking of doing something that has serious negative consequences — hence they tend to talk to me about their lives. I’ve told my husband he’s pushing the kids away, but he justifies it as good parenting. I’m so tired of this cycle. What can I do? — Tired Parent Tired Parent: There isn’t a lot you can do. But step one is to sit your husband down at a happy time and tell him you have something important to discuss. Ask him to stretch himself to listen with an open mind. Then spell out the cycle as simply as you did in your letter. Ask him to reflect on what you’ve said, if there is any part he can relate to. If he is open to the idea of accepting your influence, you could come up with a lighthearted code word (Polonius!) to let him know he’s doing it. That’s it. You’re done. One of the axioms of life is that we can’t control other people. He may continue to offer copious guidance and the kids may avoid him. It’s frustrating, but families survive worse. And to moderate your frustration, you can always remind yourself that your teens are all likely tolerating annoying and predictable behaviors from you, too! — Hilary Tired Parent: You can accept that you can’t change him and focus on your own relationship with your kids. Stop worrying about his relationship with them. Make up your mind to let the consequences fall where they may. Although you may be affected by those consequences, they are between him and the kids. Once you accept that, you can step back, take a breather and stop worrying. That’s what your kids need from you — someone who’s focused on them, not on what your husband should or shouldn’t do. You probably aren’t doing your kids any favors by letting your husband’s behavior upset you.  — Focus Tired Parent: When my kids were teens, my husband began a group text thread with them he called Life Lessons. They were general guidance texts. They included things like the lesson of compound interest, or why never to lie, or how to speak up for yourself, together with a quick related story from his life. He sent one every few weeks. Occasionally he got a response from them, usually just a “thumbs up,” but he never asked for or expected one. Years later, the kids told us how much they loved that thread, that they read every single text (maybe not right away), often shared the advice with friends, and still reread it now that they are adults. I believe they especially loved the personal stories he’d attach to them. He still does it, although much less frequently. — Write it Down? Tired Parent: Parents tend to be overbearing when they’re scared of something. I know I am! It’s tempting to go into long explanations about something, but I’ve realized that’s more about making myself feel better that I’ve explained something to them versus knowing what the actual best way is to share information with them. So one thing to ask your husband: What is he scared of? Or worried about? As a parent, most of the job is worrying. We have to figure out if what we’re doing to address these fears is for us, or for our kids. And addressing your husband’s fears can help him be less overbearing — and you’ll learn something helpful, too! — Parent/Therapist in CO Tired Parent: You can try to keep a good relationship between father and kids by encouraging family events that don’t involve lectures. All of you could go to a professional sporting event, a rock concert or the movies — anywhere talking is virtually impossible. Get your kids involved in planning and ask them what they would like to do with their dad. Then, when they are past the lecture stage, your kids will also have some happy memories with their dad. — Momjill Every week, we ask readers to answer a question submitted to Carolyn Hax’s live chat or email.

34,Carolyn Hax,Carolyn Hax: How to curb a ‘growing dislike’ of nephew’s new wife?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/12/carolyn-hax-dislike-nephew-wife/,"The letter writer’s nephew recently wed his pregnant girlfriend. After four or five etiquette strikes, is it wrong to call her “out”?",2024-06-12T04:00:00Z,"Dear Carolyn: Three months ago, our nephew married his girlfriend. They had planned to marry later, but she became pregnant, and they moved the date up. Our invitation came via email from the groom’s mother after the bride-to-be “lost” my email address, then after I re-sent the address, she “forgot” to send the invitation. We gave the couple a generous check at the wedding, and have had no acknowledgment of the gift. Now a baby shower is planned. I’ve knitted a lovely baby blanket as a gift, but the bride wants only gifts from the registry that she has “researched.” I want to like this girl, and I’m truly excited about the baby. However, she hasn’t made a very good impression. I’ve decided not to give her the blanket since I don’t think she wants a homemade gift. I’m conflicted on whether to spend even more money on a registry gift. How do I get over my growing dislike? Please help. — To Give or Not to Give To Give or Not to Give: Don’t you just hate it when people upended by simultaneous unexpected life changes don’t cross their T’s the way you want them to? Yeah, that was a little mean. And I’m in a good mood today! But, holy counted beans, Uncle/Auntie. You’ve been invited to everything. You’ve got a chance to blame various micro-offenses on this couple’s whirlwind and let them go. So what’s the real affront here? And no, I won’t ever be cheerful enough to flatten my rage spike from seeing a bride/mom held accountable for wedding or baby choices for which the groom/dad is equally freaking responsible. Men can write notes, too. How ’bout you grind this into a lens: “Times have changed, and the sexist crappiness of my times might be why.” Then view your niece-in-law only through that lens from now on. Even if some changes were for the worse, you all benefit — you especially — from the rosiest possible tint. Whooh. This, too: The hand-knit blankie is a gorgeous thought and effort. Maybe save it for the birth and work on your bond until then. Dear Carolyn: My daughter is in her 50s and very successful in her career. Since covid or a little before, she has gained a lot of weight. She works mostly from home and gets little exercise. I don’t know how to talk to her about this problem. How can I help her take better care of herself and keep her weight down? — Concerned Mother Concerned Mother: You don’t! That’s how you talk to her about this. Unless she asks you what you think, you don’t say a thing. (And yes, I will keep answering this question, because it apparently won’t go away. I’ll just work toward shorter answers each time until a final “!”.) A successful adult woman knows more about her own body than her mother does. An unsuccessful one does, too. Plus you haven’t been responsible for her eating or exercise habits in 40 years, give or take — or “parenting” her for over 30, except upon her invitation or in an emergency, which this isn’t. Even if it were, moms’ words don’t burn fat. If you fed your family according to sound nutritional advice (whatever that was at the time), and if you didn’t then, haven’t since and never intend to shame your daughter for how she manages her body, then you’ve done great. Truly. So love her as is. That’s it. If she needs more, then she’ll find ways to ask you for more. You don’t talk to her for those, though. You listen.

35,Carolyn Hax,"Carolyn Hax: She’s in her 40s and thriving, yet craves her parents’ approval",https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/06/14/carolyn-hax-daughter-craves-parent-approval/,She’s in her 40s and has the trappings of success. So why is she scrambling to hide a new tattoo from her judgy parents?,2024-06-14T04:00:00Z,"Dear Carolyn: I’m a woman in my early 40s and adulting pretty well. I have a prestigious job and wonderful children, and I’m financially independent. My marriage could use some work; that’s a different issue. Here’s my problem: I still feel like a child around my parents. I have always cared deeply about their opinion — first-child personality flaw, perhaps. But I expected that would wane over time — and it hasn’t. When I make big life decisions and even some small ones, I wonder, will they be impressed or disappointed? And I often feel hurt when they don’t offer praise when I’m expecting it. They are extremely judgmental. But I’m a competent adult; I should be able to handle it. Right? I’m now facing a ridiculous — but real — problem. I recently got my first visible tattoo, and I know my parents will be very upset. I’ve wanted one for a while, and wanted not to let my parents’ opinions shape my whole life. First step toward not caring, hurray! Yet here I am, shopping for long-sleeve rash guards for our annual beach vacation. Why am I like this, and how can I stop? Is it good to avoid the tattoo confrontation, or do I have to face the music? — Tattooed Disappointment Tattooed Disappointment: You’re like this because your parents apparently taught you to chase their approval. They did this by: 1. Withholding it most of the time, establishing hunger. 2. Praising you just enough to instill cravings for that sweet relief from their harsh judgments. 3. Giving approval unpredictably enough for you never to be sure you’d get it — so you always had hopes it was coming. If you were a lab rat, you’d be mashing the reward button all day for two? zero? random cubes of cheese. So what you describe is not a “first-child” flaw, it’s a parents-abusing-their-power flaw. A person can both be competent and struggle with the self-doubt that grows out of a childhood like that — because, fundamentally, the training denies you a sense of control over outcomes. How are you supposed to develop confidence without a meaningful connection between work and reward? Your parents taught you the connection was erratic and out of your hands. Think about it: They’re “extremely judgmental” parents who (still!) “don’t offer praise” for something good. Kind of mean, right? And why — is there a “congratulations” tax they’re avoiding? Yet you flog yourself six or seven times in a short letter for still feeling the effects of their meanness. No matter how our parents raise us, to be fair, it’s our responsibility as adults to find our own way to health — because who else will do it for us? But your heaping all the blame on yourself looks more like a symptom of emotional injury than proof of recovery. Enter the tattoo. You want to feel judgment-proof; you want to be the rat who walks away from the maybe-cheese! button. Great. But you don’t trust yourself. So you chose a statement in a secure moment that will force your hand in an insecure one (i.e., around your parents). Yet you’re doubting that plan as the insecurity creeps in. You ask whether to hide or own the tattoo. I say this in the warmest way: I don’t care. Because the more productive work is to see your struggle (shaky marriage included?) as the current expression of your past training to doubt yourself and crave external assurance. Sometimes counseling is the answer. Sometimes the “aha” is all you need to spot the lab-rattery before it hurts you. Either way — knowing where the chip was implanted is Step 1 for digging it out.

36,Glenn Kessler,"Trump’s claim that Biden lost 88,000 children, with many now ‘dead’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/10/trumps-claim-that-biden-lost-88000-children-with-many-now-dead/,"The federal government has not been able to reach these children, but this was an issue under Trump as well.",2024-06-10T10:00:35Z,"“Millions and millions of children have been separated from their families and pushed into the hands of the coyotes and the cartels. … 88,000 children are missing. … And unfortunately, many of those children are dead, just like many of the hostages held by Hamas.” — Former president Donald Trump, at a town hall in Phoenix, June 6 “You know, we have 88,000 missing children now. Can you imagine if that were Trump that had 88,000 missing children, 88,000? That’s a holocaust. That’s as bad as, I mean, think of it.” — Trump, in an interview with Dr. Phil, June 6 One of Trump’s signature moves is to turn a criticism of him into an attack on his opponents. When Trump was president, he implemented a “zero tolerance” policy at the border that resulted in children being separated from their families. The policy was widely condemned before Trump reversed course. President Biden, calling it “a moral failure,” made it a major issue in the 2020 presidential campaign. After Biden took office, he formed a task force to identify about 5,000 children who had been separated from their families. So it’s no surprise that Trump would accuse Biden of doing something similar. It’s also no surprise that he would wildly exaggerate the meaning of a number based on fact. The children aren’t missing — and they aren’t dead. In effect, they haven’t responded to phone calls from a government agency. But Trump has a point that there might be more outrage if he were president. When a similar statistic emerged during his presidency — though a much lower number of 1,475 — Democrats in 2018 such as Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) decried “1,500 lost children,” and The Washington Post published an article about the uproar, which included reference to a #WhereAreTheChildren campaign. Both the number cited by Trump and the one by Kaine refer to children who crossed the border without an adult guardian and whom the federal government is supposed to assist. But, confusingly, they are calculated with different metrics and reflect much different time periods. Let’s dig into these figures and explore what they really mean. A complicated system of laws and court cases govern the treatment of children who arrive at the border without an accompanying adult. A legal agreement known as the “Flores settlement,” struck by President Bill Clinton’s administration in 1997, requires the federal government to release, rather than detain, undocumented immigrant children — first to their parents if possible, to other adult relatives if not and to licensed programs willing to accept custody if no relatives are available. Then, a law signed by President George W. Bush, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, said unaccompanied children are exempt from prompt return to their home country, unless they come from Mexico or Canada. The fear was that otherwise the children might be stuck across the border, where they could be trafficked. Separately, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service was dismantled and the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002, responsibility for the care and placement of those children was given to an arm of the Health and Human Services Department — the Office of Refugee Resettlement. That means Homeland Security, which encountered the children, must refer them to HHS within 72 hours after border agents detain and process them at the border. As part of the refugee office’s protocol, case managers are supposed to try three times to check on the status of a child between 30 and 37 days after release to a sponsor, preferably by having a conversation with the child in addition to the sponsor. But it’s not a legal requirement for HHS to make the calls — and it’s not required that children or the sponsor answer. Trump administration officials made that point when they came under fire for the 1,500 “lost” children. “We are not in custody of the children at that point,” Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families at HHS, told reporters in 2018. “If you call a friend and they don’t answer the phone, you don’t assume that they’ve been kidnapped.” The refugee agency was especially overwhelmed when a surge of unaccompanied children flooded across the border early in the Biden presidency. The number of referrals of undocumented children from DHS to HHS averaged just over 50,000 annually in the three fiscal years before the pandemic, compared to nearly 125,000 annually in the first three years of the Biden administration, though the numbers have decreased in the past six months. An HHS inspector general report released in February said that in 22 percent of cases in March and April 2021, the refugee agency failed to make the phone calls within 38 days after a child was resettled. “For calls that occurred late, the median length of time before a call was placed was 122 days,” the report said. “The latest call that occurred for a child in our sample took place 324 days after this child was released.” Now let’s unpack the numbers used in this debate. The 1,500 figure used in Trump’s term came from a report that studied a three-month period, October to December 2017, when 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. The report found that HHS staff reached a sponsor 81 percent of the time. That meant 19 percent — or 1,475 — were not reached. That number was rounded up to 1,500 in news reports. The 88,000 figure used by Trump comes from a harrowing 2023 New York Times investigation (which won a Pulitzer Prize) about how the flood of undocumented children across the border has led to sponsors forcing underage children to work in brutal conditions, with many missing school. (The Biden administration pledged to fix the problems in response to the articles.) The New York Times figure, which actually was 85,000, reflects how many children could not be reached over a two-year calendar period (2021-2022). So the period of time is longer, but the number also uses a different standard — under the protocol HHS is supposed to reach both sponsor and child because a sponsor might mislead HHS about whether the child is working rather than attending school. Data obtained by the Times showed that in roughly 34 percent of calls, HHS was not able to reach the child. The Times article was carefully written — “the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children” — but that has not stopped Republicans from weaponizing its number as “lost,” just as Democrats did under Trump. In response to the Times report, the Biden administration has stressed that in 81 percent of cases, either the child or the sponsor (or both) has been reached — the same percentage as under Trump. That figure is a subset of the Times figure, which does not count speaking to a sponsor on behalf of a child as having reached the child. The administration has not addressed the metric used by the New York Times, but there’s no indication it has improved in the past year. From Biden’s inauguration through last month, roughly 400,000 unaccompanied children (who are not from Mexico) have come across the border and been referred to HHS. Using the percentages shown above, that roughly calculates into: Applying the same metrics to the first three years of Trump, when about 160,000 unaccompanied children were referred to HHS, calculates into: In other words, HHS’s ability to reach children or their sponsors isn’t any better under Biden than it was under Trump. The main difference is that the numbers coming across the border are so much higher under Biden, so the number of children who can’t be reached is almost three times as large. As for Trump’s rhetoric that many of the children are probably dead and that it’s a “holocaust,” that’s ridiculous. The New York Times tracked down many children and had interviews with them. By his own logic, Trump could be accused of losing 54,000 children. A campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for an explanation. “Congressional Republicans and others continue to misuse the data or blatantly lie,” HHS spokesman Jeff Nesbit said in a statement. “HHS and several other federal agencies assist and provide services to unaccompanied children who arrive in the United States. HHS takes custody of a child from DHS and provides care until the child is released to a vetted sponsor. Following the [child’s] release to a vetted sponsor, HHS voluntarily places an initial wellbeing call. In addition, HHS offers post-release services including counseling and support to help children enroll in schools, as well as facilitating legal assistance at court hearings. It is erroneous and dangerous for anyone to misrepresent data to fear monger.” As usual, Trump takes a fact and twists it into an absurdity. The Biden administration’s inability to reach undocumented children in the United States — especially in light of the Times reporting — is a serious issue. Indeed, the 85,000 figure in the New York Times is now out of date. Our calculations suggest it’s now about 135,000. But the Trump administration’s performance in reaching children appears to be not any better — and no one is claiming that the 54,000 children who were “lost” under Trump are now dead. Trump’s over-the-top rhetoric is in the Four Pinocchio realm, but unusually, he’s relying on a legitimate news report for his figure. And his “missing” rhetoric is little different from the way Democrats framed lower numbers during his administration. So we will award him Three Pinocchios for the number.

37,"Adriana Usero, Glenn Kessler","‘Cheapfake’ Biden videos enrapture right-wing media, but deeply mislead",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/14/cheapfake-biden-videos-enrapture-right-wing-media-deeply-mislead/,"No, the president didn’t wander off. He didn’t freeze either.",2024-06-14T21:17:40Z,"“What is Biden doing?” — Republican National Committee social media post, 1:01 p.m., June 13 “Biden wanders away at G-7 summit before being pulled back by Italian PM” — headline of New York Post article, posted less than two hours later “Meander in Chief: Biden embarrasses U.S. with confused wanderings at world conference.” — front page of New York Post, posted June 14 A particularly effective attack on a political candidate can come in the form of a video snippet that appears to reinforce an existing stereotype. The social media feed of the RNC regularly churns out misleading clips of President Biden, 81, intended to show that he is too old for the job. Biden’s Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, turned 78 on Friday, but polls show there is less concern about his physical and mental fitness for office. In a recent Pew Research poll released in April, fewer than a quarter of voters expressed a high degree of confidence in Biden’s mental fitness (21 percent) and physical fitness (15 percent). By contrast, about four in ten voters were extremely or very confident about Trump’s mental and physical fitness. So there is an incentive for the Republicans to keep hammering away at a perceived vulnerability for Biden. This past week, the RNC feed has misleadingly called attention to two video clips of Biden. One was so distorted that it resulted in a “community note” on the X platform calling out its dishonesty. But the RNC’s dismal track record — which we have highlighted on multiple occasions — has not stopped right-leaning outfits from echoing the RNC’s framing and reinforcing its narrative that Biden has lost a step. On June 13, at about 1 p.m., the RNC posted a clip it captioned, “What is Biden doing?” The post has been viewed more than 3 million times. Biden is seen with other Group of Seven leaders watching skydivers in Italy, carrying the flags of the nations. Biden turns and walks a few steps to chat with one of the parachutists, the only leader to do so. Then Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni turns him back to the other leaders. In one feed distributed by news services — the one used by the RNC — it’s not entirely clear who Biden is talking to, but an alternative feed, also distributed by news services, makes it clear that Biden is having a conversation. The New York Post jumped on the RNC clip, posting a story less than two hours later and embedding the RNC post. When the White House cried foul, saying the video had been taken out of context, the newspaper buried that comment in the bottom of the story, while noting that the video feed had been distributed by news services. (None characterized it as the RNC did. C-SPAN, for instance, titled its video: “President Biden & G-7 Leaders Watch Skydiving Demonstration.”) The New York Post went on to make the fake story the cover of its print edition. The New York Post video on social media was a vertical edit, which further removed the context of Biden’s conversation — nothing of the panoramic view to the right and left can be seen. This is a good example of how cutting a viral “moment” vertically, without taking into account what’s going on in the rest of the frame, can alter perception. An X community note was added to the video clip, saying: “Biden didn’t ‘wander off’. After viewing a skydiving demo with the other G-7 leaders, Biden stepped aside to speak with one of the other skydivers who is kneeling on the ground packing away his chute. The video in the above post has been digitally altered to remove the skydiver.” A few hours later, for undisclosed reasons, the community note was changed to simply say “the video was cropped,” with a link to a 14-minute clip on the YouTube channel of Sinclair Broadcasting, another conservative outlet. The new note does little to combat the framing of the post: “President Biden appeared to wander off at the G-7 summit in Italy, with officials needing to pull him back to focus.” Another news organization that regularly follows the signals of the RNC feed is the Telegraph newspaper in Britain. It published an article that accepted the RNC’s framing even as it quoted the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, as saying the story was bunk. “Sunak defends Biden after he ‘wandered off’ at G-7 event: Video shows U.S. president drifting away from leaders during a photo op with parachutists,” the headline said. The Telegraph’s YouTube channel framed the clip this way: “Joe Biden appears to walk off during G-7 flag ceremony.” Jake Schneider, the RNC’s rapid response director, defended the use of the clip, saying it “came straight from the official G-7 feed.” He added: “Joe Biden is not only lost and confused, but he is also weak, failed, and dishonest.” Representatives of the New York Post and the Telegraph did not respond to requests for comment. (Robert Winnett, a deputy editor of the Telegraph, will become editor of The Washington Post in November.) Earlier in the week, the Telegraph ran another article based on a misleading RNC clip: “Watch: Biden appears to freeze at White House concert.” The article was based entirely on speculation, advanced by the RNC, that Biden had some sort of episode that caused him to freeze. The article suggested that the person next to him “seemed to notice something was amiss, putting his arm around Mr. Biden before the pair bumped fists.” In a post on June 10 that had 3.3 million views, the RNC asked: “Why isn’t Biden moving?” In the clip, Biden is standing still while people around him are dancing at a Juneteenth celebration. The full video, when it pans, shows other people similarly standing still at the right end of the screen. Biden, as he did in this 2009 Associated Press interview, has often said he doesn’t dance. “Joe Biden wants to make one thing clear: He can’t dance,” the article said, quoting him as saying “the reason I want to keep talking is because I can’t dance.” The article noted that at an inaugural ball he danced “stiffly” with his wife, Jill. “I may not be able to dance, but I sure like holding her,” Biden said. “Unfortunately, some of President Biden’s right-wing critics don’t respect their readers or themselves and resort to misinformation and cheap fakes because his performance in office — fueling the strongest economic growth in the world, bringing violent crime to historic lows, and advancing our national security in the world — is so threatening to them that they feel a need to make things up,” deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement. “It’s also telling that President Biden’s critics believe that giving a thumbs up to a skydiver or taking the time to thank veterans in Normandy is somehow negative.” The use of these clips is an especially pernicious couple of examples of manipulated video — what we label “isolation” under our guide to manipulated video — because it’s intended to create a false narrative that doesn’t reflect the event as it occurred.

38,Glenn Kessler,Unpacking the story of Fauci and painful experiments involving dogs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/07/unpacking-story-fauci-painful-experiments-involving-dogs/,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) confronted the former top NIH official about what she called a “disgusting and evil” study.,2024-06-07T10:00:04Z,"“As director of NIH, you did sign off on these so-called scientific experiments. And as a dog lover, I want to tell you this is disgusting and evil. What you signed off on and these experiments that happened to beagles paid for by the American taxpayer. And I want you to know Americans don’t pay their taxes for animals to be tortured like this.” — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), questioning Anthony S. Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), during a House hearing on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, June 3 “What does dogs have to do with anything that we’re talking about today?” — Fauci, in response. During the coronavirus hearing this week, Greene attacked Fauci as she held up a photo of two sedated puppies, their heads placed in mesh cages, as they lie on a table while being swarmed by sand flies. Outside the hearing, an ad truck commissioned by a group opposed to taxpayer-funded animal experiments circled Capitol Hill with billboards that showed Fauci together with this photo and directed people to a website called BeagleGate.org. The group, the White Coat Waste Project, is founded and run by people with links to conservative-leaning organizations, The Washington Post has reported. When we first saw Greene hold up the photo, we figured this would be easy to debunk — another in a string of misleading attacks against Fauci, who became the public face of the government’s response to the pandemic. After all, when this first became an issue in 2021 — unrelated to covid then as it is now but part of a general effort among conservatives to discredit Fauci in any way possible — a raft of fact checks noted that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said the study in question, conducted in Tunisia, had been attributed in error to the agency that Fauci ran, a division of NIH. The scientific journal that published the study issued a correction. NIH said that it did fund a study in Tunisia involving dogs and sand flies, but NIH suggested that study was a more benign one that allowed the dogs to roam. But it’s more complicated than that, a review of NIH emails and documents obtained by the group since 2021 under the Freedom of Information Act suggests. Some of the documents call into question NIH’s statements at the time, part of what appears to be a bungled public relations response. What’s less complicated is that it’s silly to personally blame Fauci for the design of research studies — about 5,500 were approved by NIAID just in 2023 — endorsed many levels below the director. “The experiments that NIH funded go through strict regulatory processes of the treatment of animals, the humane treatment of animals,” Fauci said in response to another lawmaker who raised the issue in the hearing this week. “I signed off on them because they were approved by a peer review.” Female sand flies carry a parasite that produces zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL), an often-neglected tropical disease in humans. Domestic dogs are the main reservoir host and sand flies are the main vector. The problem is especially acute in Tunisia, where a 1996 study of 50 cases in one hospital found a mortality rate of about 6 percent in children under the age of 5. Animals are often used in research, where they serve as “models” that allow for investigation of a problem. NIH, on its website, notes that fish, frogs, fruit flies and roundworms are used to understand biological processes that could affect humans. But there is something about using dogs — especially common household pets such as beagles — that make many people squeamish. According to the most recent annual animal usage report by the U.S. Agriculture Department, nearly 16,000 dogs in 2019 were subjected to pain in the United States during research experiments — and nearly 400 received no pain medication. The White Coat Waste Project hit a nerve when it publicized the Tunisia sand fly study in 2021, emphasizing the dramatic photo that Greene waved at Fauci. The Post reported that Fauci’s office got 3,600 phone calls in 36 hours. A bipartisan letter signed by 24 members of Congress, citing the group’s reports on animal studies, said that lawmakers had “grave concerns about reports of costly, cruel, and unnecessary taxpayer-funded experiments on dogs.” The Tunisian sand fly study pictured in the photo was published on July 27, 2021, in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The study described how the beagles, between 6 and 8 months old, and obtained from the kennels of the Pasteur Institute of Tunis, were sedated and then exposed to hundreds of sand flies that had been deprived of food for 24 hours. That August, the study caught the attention of White Coat Waste, where the story was quickly picked up by right-leaning websites. In late October 2021, CNN asked Fauci to appear for an interview, and one of his staff members suggested late on Oct. 24 that Fauci pause any TV interviews “until we get a handle on this.” Early the next morning, Fauci emailed 12 officials and asked them to “tell me what grant or contract they are referring to.” Within two hours, one replied that they might have identified the grant. (Most staff members’ names are redacted.) “Let us find out for sure if it is that grant, and then let us take a look at what the experimental design is, and importantly whether it has received the appropriate ethical and animal care consideration,” Fauci replied in an email. “I want this done right away since we are getting bombarded by protests.” Within two hours, one of the researchers involved, Abhay Satoskar, a professor of pathology and microbiology at Ohio State University, emailed to say that NIAID had been mistakenly cited as a funder of the study and that he would seek a correction from the journal. One NIAID official wrote in an email that Satoskar “stated that it was mistakenly cited because he was not clear of the true purpose of US funding acknowledgment” and that the program in question had been funded only by the Pasteur Institute. NIAID issued a public statement on Oct. 26 saying it had funded a separate sand flies project involving the study of a vaccine to prevent leishmaniasis. In this study, 12 dogs were given the vaccine and then put in “an enclosed open space” outside during high sand fly season, NIAID said, to see whether the dogs still became infected. The emails obtained by White Coat Waste show that NIAID officials were relying on Satoskar’s statement and had no independent knowledge of whether it was correct. When an Associated Press reporter doing a fact check asked for proof that NIAID did not fund the project, one NIH official on Oct. 28 internally admitted it had none. “Our evidence is simply the statement of the PI, Dr. Satoskar,” the official wrote to another NIAID official, using an abbreviation for principal investigator, according to the emails. The official added: “It is not uncommon for investigators to give very wide attribution to grants and contracts that supported a given project, so it is not surprising that they went too broad in acknowledging support of the publication.” Matthew Fenton, director of NIAID’s Division of Extramural Activities, replied as part of the email chain: “It seems to me that the only way to prove that the grant funds weren’t used for other projects is to do an audit of those grant expenditures and invoices. This would not be something that could be done quickly.” NIH declined to answer whether an audit was ever undertaken and whether NIAID confirmed what Satoskar said. Meanwhile, the emails show that when Satoskar asked Shaden Kamhawi, the editor of the journal, to correct the article, she agreed immediately but noted internally that she might have a conflict of interest because she was an employee of NIAID. (Her bio on the NIAID website also listed Satoskar as one of her “main collaborators.”) “As I am an NIAID employee, I am not sure if there is a COi here so please let me know,” she wrote in an email to colleagues that was written just six hours after Fauci first asked for information. NIH also declined to answer questions about her potential conflict, but the emails obtained by White Coat Waste contain a draft statement to be given to reporters if the question arose. “The request for a correction of the funding statement came from the authors of the study,” the statement said. “It is a standard policy of the journal of PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and its responsibility as a publisher to correct publication errors when made aware of them. None of Dr. Kamhawi’s supervisors at NIAID were involved with the journal’s decision to make this correction.” The press guidance said Kamhawi became aware of the issue only in November, though the internal emails show she learned of it on Oct. 25, the same day Fauci asked about it. When The Post reported on the controversy in November 2021, the article noted: “The trapped-beagles study does not appear in a database of NIH-funded projects.” The emails show that, while it was removed before the publication of The Post article, the study had been listed in the database for months and was still listed as of the previous month, when Fauci first asked about the controversy. “We need that to be corrected too, ASAP please,” one NIH staffer wrote on Oct. 27. The anxiety level rose as officials realized it would take several days, until Nov. 1, before the project would be removed from the database — where reporters could not then find it. NIH also declined to answer questions about the removal of the study from the database. Finally, other documents obtained by White Coat Waste suggest the Tunisia study funded by NIH was not as benign as the agency suggested. Instead of an “enclosed open space,” the study’s grant application shows a photograph that indicated that the dogs were kept in a cage as they were “exposed to sand fly bites each night through the sand fly season to ensure transmission.” The grant application also described how, separately, dogs would be sedated and placed in cages for two hours while they were exposed to 15 to 30 female sand flies. In a statement, NIH said: “The two studies began at different times and involved different animals. The study in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases used symptomatic animals from previous studies approved by that grantee institution’s animal care and use committee in 2012. NIAID funds were used for an R21 study [Exploratory/Developmental Grant] that started in August 2018 and ended in July 2021. Information from the principal investigator shows 12 healthy dogs were vaccinated and sent into the field in 2019 for natural exposure during Sand fly season (August to November) to test a candidate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) vaccine. According to the study’s principal investigator, the 12 dogs were healthy and did not have symptoms of VL at the conclusion of the NIAID-funded grant period.” Satoskar referred questions to Benjamin Johnson, an Ohio State University spokesman. “We have nothing more to add,” Johnson said. The emails show that NIH was not fully transparent as it tried to handle a public-relations nightmare. Perhaps there was little reason to doubt Satoskar, but officials embraced his explanation without confirming as they rushed out a statement. They made no acknowledgment that they had removed the study from the NIH grant database or that the editor of the journal that quickly issued the correction had a potential conflict of interest. Moreover, the NIH study in Tunisia that the agency said it funded was cast in a positive light that is undermined by the grant application that has since been made public.

Michael Rafidi took home the award for outstanding chef for his Michelin-starred Levantine restaurant Albi, beloved by The Washington Post’s food critic Tom Sietsema for its pita bread, baba ganoush and steamed manti, among many other dishes. Palestinian American chef Rafidi, who dedicated the award to the Palestinian people, is also the owner of Yellow, a cafe and restaurant in Georgetown that recently announced the planned opening of a Union Market location later this year. He was handed his medal by 2023 outstanding chef Rob Rubba, of plant-based D.C. favorite Oyster Oyster. D.C.-area restaurants took home two more awards at this year’s Beard Awards, held Monday at Chicago’s Lyric Opera. The awards are among the highest honors that chefs, restaurants and their operators can receive nationally, and they recognize excellence in the kitchen and in restaurant operations. Awards are also given for cookbooks, literature and journalism about food. Masako Morishita, of storied and colorful Adams Morgan Japanese fusion spot Perry’s, opened the night with the award for emerging chef, one of the event’s most prestigious awards. Morishita, originally from Kobe and the first Japanese woman to hold the role at Perry’s, emphasizes creativity in her cooking. “This is my wildest American Dream come true,” she exclaimed as she accepted the medal, and repeated to The Post. “The cuisine I cook is Japanese comfort food, which has been overshadowed by other types of Japanese cuisine. I hope I made all the Japanese moms proud.” In another major win, Harley Peet won best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. His restaurant, Bas Rouge in Easton, Md., dishes out international fusion flavors including beef tataki with dehydrated kimchi and grilled shrimp stuffed with jalapeños. “It’s still sinking in,” he said to The Post. “To bring [the award] home to the Eastern Shore — to be the first to do it — is super special. We don’t have the luxury of an endless stream of customers. Our dining rooms aren’t always full. So hopefully, that will help [the Eastern Shore].” D.C. also took home an honor in the media categories, announced Saturday: “The World Central Kitchen Cookbook” by José Andrés, his nonprofit World Central Kitchen and Sam Chapple-Sokol won the award for best international cookbook, which recognizes books that are “focused on food or cooking traditions of countries, regions, or communities outside of the United States.” Also honored at the awards were several other finalists from the D.C. area: Susan Bae and Kevin Tien of Moon Rabbit, nominated for outstanding pastry chef or baker and best chef Mid-Atlantic, respectively; Tony Conte of Inferno Pizzeria Napoletana in Darnestown, Md., nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic; Baltimore Mexican restaurant Clavel Mezcaleria, nominated for outstanding bar; Tail Up Goat, nominated for outstanding wine and other beverage program; and Hollis Wells Silverman of Eastern Point Collective, nominated for outstanding restaurateur."
42,Chris Kelly,Pro wrestler Bryan Danielson on trading the ring for time with his kids,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/11/bryan-danielson-dc/,Danielson will take part in an AEW match at EagleBank Arena on June 19.,2024-06-11T14:00:47Z,"After a life in the ring, All Elite Wrestling star Bryan Danielson is ready to go home. The pro wrestling legend is ending his full-time career to spend more time with his kids. Despite being a pro wrestler for nearly 25 years, Danielson is still at the peak of his powers. In the last year alone, he’s wrestled global legends and the next generation’s stars, traveled to the Tokyo Dome and Arena México, and, most recently, taken part in a true-to-its-title “Anarchy in the Arena” match that included not only folding chairs and garbage cans but thumbtacks and a flamethrower. The 43-year-old is massively popular, performs at a high level and is considered by many to be the greatest technical wrestler of all time. So why is the “American Dragon” hanging up his boots? “I’m going to end my full-time career here this year so I can be more present and more at home with my kids,” Danielson says. “They’re at an age where they want me around, and that’s not going to exist forever. There’s that magic before you get a little bit older that I want to be around for.” Pro wrestling, especially at Danielson’s level, demands an itinerant lifestyle with plenty of time on the road or in the air. Recently, the AEW star has been featured on the company’s two main shows, “Dynamite” on Wednesdays and “Collision” on Saturdays, and he’s constantly traveling away from his home on the West Coast for runs of shows. The schedule is tough on everyone. “It’s not only hard for the kids, it’s hard on my wife, too, because she’s not even a stay-at-home mom — which is a hard job as it is — she runs three companies, and she’s got her own wine tasting thing in Napa,” he says. His wife, Brie Garcia, understands the grueling life of a pro wrestler, because she was one, too. She performed for World Wrestling Entertainment for more than a decade under the name Brie Bella. As part of the Bella Twins, alongside sister Nikki, Brie was a key part of the women’s division and anchored a pair of reality shows about the real lives of female wrestlers (or, at least, as “real” as pro wrestlers on a reality show can be). Garcia met Danielson when he also wrestled for WWE, under the name Daniel Bryan, and they married in 2014. He spent the majority of his career at WWE and became a global icon as a fan-favorite underdog who took over pop culture with his “Yes!” chant and eventually became world champion. But his time at the top was cut short: Danielson was forced to retire in 2016 due to concussion-related issues. After several years on the bench, and countless tests and evaluations, he was cleared to return to the ring in 2018 and remained a top star in WWE for three more years. When his contract expired in 2021, he jumped ship to AEW, an upstart founded in 2019 that delivers more authentic “pro wrestling” than the “sports entertainment” favored by WWE. Since then, Danielson has relished the opportunity to wrestle different styles, from technical showcases to bloody brawls, and revels in the fact that he gets to wrestle at all, considering the health issues that led to his hiatus. “Since I’ve come back from that retirement, I don’t take it for granted that I get to do this,” he says. When he steps away from the ring full time this year, it probably won’t be because of his injuries (although it always could: In the last year, he’s broken an arm and an orbital bone). It will be because of a promise he made to his daughter Birdie, who was born in 2017, that he would wind down his career when she turned 7. Birdie doesn’t watch too much wrestling; her brother Buddy, who was born in 2020, can get a “little aggressive” as it is. However, Garcia did let the kids watch a pay-per-view last year where Danielson had a “strap match” in which he was attached by the wrist to his opponent with a length of leather. During the no-disqualification contest, both men were “bleeding buckets.” Birdie was “horrified,” and Garcia covered by saying the blood was ketchup. Buddy didn’t buy it. “When I got home after that, he had scraped his shin and it was bleeding and he goes, ‘Look, Daddy, it’s ketchup, just like yours,’” he says, imitating the toddler’s sarcastic tone. Explaining why Daddy is fighting on TV while bleeding profusely isn’t the weirdest thing about being a wrestler and a father. Danielson’s children have his action figure, and it took Birdie a while to understand why that wasn’t the case with her friends and their parents. As his days as a full-time wrestler wind down, Danielson is focused on making memories. During every match, he takes a moment to close his eyes and absorb the experience in the ring, from the physical contact to the crowd reactions. “There’s just this energy that you can feel inside your body. To me, it’s unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced,” he says. He’s hoping that the exercise will allow him to tap into those sensations down the line, when he’s at home, wrestling only once or twice a year, and missing the activity that he has done for nearly 25 years. Maybe that will be enough. “The hard part of letting go,” he says, “is that I still love it so much.” “AEW Presents Dynamite & Rampage,” June 19 at 7:30 p.m. at EagleBank Arena, 4500 Patriot Cir., Fairfax. eaglebankarena.com. $25-$95."
43,Michael O'Sullivan,DC/DOX returns to downtown with a bursting slate of documentaries,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/12/dc-documentary-film-fest/,"The festival includes films about Christopher Reeve, NYC psychics, hummingbirds, Ani DiFranco, the opioid crisis and more.",2024-06-12T14:00:06Z,"Any documentary festival is, according to Sky Sitney, “literally an invitation for transformation.” She ought to know: Sitney was director of Washington’s premiere showcase of documentary film, AFI Docs (formerly Silverdocs), for eight years, before stepping down in 2014. The following year, she went on to co-found Double Exposure, co-directing that Washington-based festival of investigative nonfiction film through 2022. When AFI Docs paused operations indefinitely that year, Sitney and PR executive Jamie Shor stepped into the vacuum created by AFI Docs’ absence, throwing together an entirely new festival. After a “skinny” one-day showcase of documentaries in 2022 and a fuller festival last year, DC/DOX returns June 13-16 with a fat slate of 51 features and 47 shorts at venues throughout the city. We caught up with Sitney and Shor over Zoom to find out what to expect from the festival and how to navigate it. Where is it? Although most screenings take place at Landmark’s E Street Cinema (555 11th St. NW), the festival hub and hospitality headquarters is at the Eaton hotel (1201 K St. NW), which also has an in-house cinema. Other venues include the National Archives, the National Gallery of Art, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of American History, and the U.S. Navy Memorial’s Burke Theater. Sitney calls the festival’s themes “expansive” but the screening locations’ footprint “tight.” With the exception of the Eaton — and the nearby Planet Word, where the fest’s panels and workshops take place — the screening venues are all within a few blocks of one another. How much are tickets? Most individual screenings are $15, plus tax. All-access passes are available for $195. Panels and workshops are $10, and events at Smithsonian museums are always free. Is there a unifying theme? In short, no. If there’s any synergy between films — multiple works address Ukraine and the opioid crisis, for example — it’s entirely accidental, says Sitney, “and it should be.” As for the opening night film, “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” (June 13 at 7 p.m. at the National Museum of American History), Sitney says the profile of the late actor “kind of lays some unexpected kernels for things that are going to be happening” through the festival: notions of “transformation, resilience, hope and advocacy, an investment in the future.” Shor adds that the Reeve film shares a theme of universality with the fest’s other marquee offerings: “Luther: Never Too Much,” about the late R&B singer Luther Vandross (June 14 and 16); “Look Into My Eyes,” an intimate study of New York City psychics (June 15); and the closing night offering, about hummingbird rehabilitation, “Every Little Thing” (June 16). Shor says these four stories are where “we invite the totality of our audience in, and then invite them to look behind the curtain at other issue areas that may not be commonly shared.” This is D.C. Is it mostly policy wonk stuff? Relax, says Shor. “Because of living in this environment, we all talk about government and politics all the time, but we also talk about art and music and sports and true crime and all of those other things.” There are films about the photography giants of the 20th century, singer Ani DiFranco, daredevil Russian climbers and an expert on serial killers with a dark secret. How can I find my jam? Go to dcdoxfest.com, select “Films” from the drop-down “Program” menu, and refine your search from a menu of 42 interests including DC[Frame], which includes two features and two shorts programs made by filmmakers from the area on themes of significance to locals. What’s the most intriguing non-screening event? Most of the “Reality Check” panels and workshops aim to foster networking and community-building among filmmaking professionals, but there’s one program that may offer wider appeal. On June 14 at 4 p.m. at Planet Word, filmmaker Keith Moore will present a live documentary performance featuring a talk paired with film footage from an abortive project of his — never finished, it was a victim of creative blockage and funding problems — about controversial Berkeley-based performance artist, public access TV host, shaman and commune leader Frank Moore (no relation). Film festivals are normally about the completed product. “We rarely get a look at what is actually a much more common experience for many people in this creative space,” Sitney says, “which is the messy middle.” Sitney calls the hybrid work “almost a performance of the failure to succeed. It’s self-deprecating, but it also reveals some of the systemic problems of the industry.”"
44,Chris Kelly,"Dresden Dolls’ new album has old punk cabaret vibes, fresh vulnerability",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/12/dresden-dolls-concert-dc/,The band will play Friday and Saturday night at 9:30 Club.,2024-06-12T15:00:09Z,"There’s never been an act quite like the Dresden Dolls. The duo of singer-songwriter-pianist Amanda Palmer and drummer Brian Viglione built a cult following in the 2000s with melodramatic tunes and a theatrical aesthetic, beating critics to the punch by calling their style “Brechtian punk cabaret.” Onstage, in black velvet, bowler hats and mime makeup, the pair looked like a bar band in a Tim Burton movie, drawing from street performance traditions, putting a premium on crowd participation, and unspooling piano-and-drum-fueled crescendos. The Dolls toured constantly and released three albums before going on an extended hiatus in 2008. Since then, Viglione drummed for Nine Inch Nails, the Violent Femmes and countless side projects, while Palmer embarked on a solo career that brought notoriety (and internet infamy) via a TED Talk, a best-selling memoir and pioneering crowdfunding work. During this time, the Dolls never broke up; they played a few special shows a year and never said “never” about recording new music. “It wasn’t that the Dresden Dolls didn’t work,” Palmer says. “That’s not why we separated as a band. Mostly we were just burned out and tired, sick of the grind and kind of sick of each other. But there was no way we could look at our body of work and our fan base and say that anything within it was broken.” The band first started talking seriously about working on a new album almost a decade ago, but Palmer gave birth to a son in 2015 and was “bumbling [her] way back to normal” when the pandemic hit. Compounding the disruption, she had been on tour in New Zealand when the country went on lockdown, where she remained for 2½ years. “It was one thing after another knocking us — to be fair to Brian, knocking me — off track, because my life just kept getting sideswiped,” she says. But during the band’s last few tours, they’ve finally been able to get on the same page, convening at a barn turned rehearsal space near Palmer’s home in Woodstock, N.Y. Recently, they’ve been playing about eight or nine new songs right in the middle of their sets. “Here is everything we have for the new record, so we hope you’re with us,” Viglione says of what they’ve told audiences. “Sing along like you’ve heard it a million times before.” Not only have the Dolls been blown away by the reception to the new material, but it is passing muster of their committee of two. The pair are bringing the new tools they’ve picked up in the intervening years — around improvisation, collaboration, songwriting, self-care — and applying them to their old dynamic. “This new record is scary for me to play; the songs scare me,” Palmer says. “That’s how I know they’re good.” Amid the new material are old favorites like “Coin-Operated Boy” and “Girl Anachronism,” songs the duo has played hundreds of times. But instead of feeling like the nostalgia fests that have increasingly become a staple of venue and festival stages, the Dolls have never gone through the motions. “Every molecule of our bodies is focused on the creation of that music in that time,” Viglione says. “It’s such a purity of emotion in what’s being put across.” Palmer adds, “You can’t phone these songs in, because then they don’t work.” The Dresden Dolls have always faced fear and tangoed with life’s fraught topics. Palmer has never shied away from vulnerability, even if that means singing lyrics about mental health, abortion and rape, and the Dolls’ two-person unit was the core that made that possible. “I desperately wanted to find and create a community where I felt safe enough to sing these songs, because singing these songs was scary. They were so personal; they still are,” Palmer says. “I was only able to do it with someone like Brian who was absolutely there to hold the space. … That was kind of a radical act.” The safety of that act flowed outward from the duo and gained greater strength in numbers as the Dolls found an audience marked by “a certain type of humanity [with] a certain type of kookiness, awkwardness, and a desire to play and be creative,” as Viglione says. Not that the Dresden Dolls were deliberate about trying to reach particular groups of outsiders, be they queer kids or musical theater kids: They just worked to be radically inclusive and hoped like-minded listeners would find the band and join the fun. That aim is still true, nearly a quarter century after Palmer and Viglione met, appropriately enough, at a Halloween party, setting down the path that would lead them to become the Dresden Dolls. “Bring everybody, bring your friends, bring your kids, bring your old people, come dress up, celebrate life, be queer, don’t be queer, be whoever you want to be — the Dresden Dolls will take you in,” Palmer says. Or, as Viglione sees it, “I’m getting visions of the Statue of Liberty with a black umbrella and stripy tights.” June 14 and 15 at 8 p.m. at 9:30 Club, 815 V St. NW. 930.com.

She’s the same woman who appeared on the Scottish band’s 2001 debut album cover, and for those in the know, it’s a nod to the band’s journey and the resilience that led to its most recent stop. As its name and imagery allude, the record, released last month, finds its writers at a crossroads. “I wrote [the title track] in the middle of the pandemic, wondering what was going on, but also the bigger picture of what was going on with me and what I was going to do,” singer Tracyanne Campbell says on a recent Zoom call from her band’s tour bus. “What’s the band’s future, and what direction are we going to go in? It’s a song about trying to be optimistic and aware of choices in life.” For nearly two decades, Camera Obscura delivered a delightful Americana-infused brand of Glaswegian indie pop to twee fans long before Tumblr (or, God forbid, TikTok) got ahold of the term. But in 2015, that run was cut short by the death of keyboardist Carey Lander of bone cancer, and for years, the band went dark. During that hiatus, Campbell had a child and made an album under the name Tracyanne & Danny, with English singer-songwriter Danny Coughlan. In 2019, she was asked by fellow Scottish soft rockers Belle & Sebastian — including singer Stuart Murdoch, who produced Camera Obscura’s first album — to join them and others on a nostalgic concert cruise and play some of the band’s songs. “I said, ‘Absolutely not, because this is Tracyanne & Danny,’” she says. “‘If you want the band, you can ask them to play.’ People up until that point were maybe, respectfully, trying to be sensitive to the fact that we’d lost [Lander]. Maybe we just weren’t in the shop window anymore. It had never occurred to me that we would play shows or not play shows.” But for Campbell, preparing for a 2019 reunion at the Boaty Weekender (“like Glasgow in the middle of the Mezze,” Campbell recalls) set in motion a period of newfound inspiration. The band found a new keyboardist in Donna Maciocia and started making music again; the lyrics came easily. “The band had a new lease on life. … [There was] something very fresh about what was going on,” Campbell says. “When you start going in a room again after such a long time, especially after what happened, it just provokes lots of emotion.” After a pandemic-shaped delay, the resulting album is “Look to the East, Look to the West,” produced by two-time collaborator Jari Haapalainen and containing all of the quippy lyricism, floaty earworms and subtle twang (now courtesy of Campbell’s husband Tim Davidson’s pedal steel guitar) that fans have long adored. It lacks the string arrangements and “bells and whistles,” Campbell says, to opt for something more intimate, more in line with the musical talents the band flaunts today. It’s their first album in 11 years, but it’s not nostalgia-core. “We weren’t interested in coming back and playing a greatest hits set,” Campbell says. “Not having something new to say, there’s no point to it, as far as I’m concerned.” June 19 at 7 p.m. at 9:30 Club, 815 V St. NW. 9:30.com. $32."
47,Ty Burr,‘Tuesday’ is a dark flight of fancy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/06/13/tuesday-julia-louis-dreyfus-movie-review/,Death is the thing with feathers in a strange Julia Louis-Dreyfus drama titled “Tuesday.”,2024-06-13T10:00:01Z,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The personification of death is not the grim reaper, nor a pale horseman, nor an Irish banshee, but a parrot. The parrot — all right, a macaw, if we’re being specific — can hear the voices of the dying and flies in to ease their pain, raising its wing over their faces the way a priest lowers the eyelids of the dead. It can also grow to the size of a dinosaur or shrink to the size of a tick. The victims see this as perfectly normal, if a little alarming. This is the dramatic setup for a movie called “Tuesday,” and it’s to the credit of writer-director Daina O. Pusić, a Croatian filmmaker making her feature debut, that she establishes the reality of this fantastical concept in the space of three eerie, elegant opening minutes. But then the rest of the movie happens, and it’s a bumpy ride indeed. The other thing you should know is that Tuesday is not a day in “Tuesday” but a girl: a terminally ill 15-year-old Londoner (Lola Petticrew) who hasn’t left her bedroom in weeks, if not months, and who is visited by the Macaw of Death early in the movie. What’s unusual is that Tuesday doesn’t immediately recoil in fear but talks calmly to Death. Death, relieved to be able to have a conversation for once, talks back. The Nigerian-born, London-raised actor Arinzé Kene provides the bird’s voice, a guttural croak that seems to carry the wisdom and weariness of the ages. There’s a third point to the dramatic triangle in “Tuesday,” and it’s the dying girl’s mother, Zora, who is played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a change-of-pace performance that some will call brave and others will call foolhardy. They’re both right. Zora has put up a tough and cheerful front for her daughter, but behind the bravura, she’s a wreck who has quit her job and sold half her household to pay for Tuesday’s care. (Why hasn’t the girl noticed the movers coming to cart the furniture away? What exactly is Tuesday dying of? Where’s her father? Why is Zora American and her daughter British? If you find yourself asking these questions, you’re obviously an insensitive lout.) “Tuesday” is a parable about grieving, and accepting the inevitability of death, that keeps getting sidetracked by the startling literalness of its conceit. The visual effects teams headed by Mike Stillwell and Andrew Simmonds renders Death as a bewitching feathered creation, mysterious and powerful yet oddly sympathetic — half animal consciousness, half angel. The creature gets so caught up in its relationship with Tuesday that it forgets to do its job, and in classic Death Takes a Holiday tradition, an apocalypse slowly envelops London and the world as the dying simply aren’t able to die. Pusić plays these vignettes for horror-movie gore, even as the tenderness of the Tuesday/macaw connection gets drowned out by the mother’s increasingly frenzied attempts to keep Death from her daughter’s bedside. Well, what would you do if it were your child? Is it possible to kill Death? Is it worth a try? Louis-Dreyfus’s performance is a curio, rigid with intensity, trembling with fury and sadness, and finally burning with a zeal that results in some of the movie’s more indelible scenes. I can say no more other than to note that the mother herself goes through a few changes that evoke Lewis Carroll at his most extreme. (By contrast, Petticrew anchors the movie with pale, assured intelligence as the daughter.) Aside from a few appearances by a bewildered young hospice nurse (Leah Harvey), “Tuesday” is effectively a three-hander of mother/daughter/bird that grows increasingly serious and strange as it goes. Unlike in similar metaphysical fantasy-dramas of recent years — I’m thinking of George Miller’s “Three Thousand Years of Longing” (2022), with Tilda Swinton and a genie in the shape of Idris Elba locked in a hotel room, or the lovely, limbo-set “Nine Days” (2020) — the strangeness and tonal shifts clutter the foreground in “Tuesday” to the point that they block out the difficult and delicate emotions that Pusić is intent on addressing. Because the death of one’s child is pretty much the worst thing most people can imagine, the director and her star are to be commended for taking a creative core sample of the pitch-black emotions surrounding this fact. At its intermittent best, “Tuesday” pulls a rough and breathtaking beauty from the cataclysm. At its worst, it’s for the birds. R. At area theaters. Contains strong language. 111 minutes.

50,Mark Jenkins,How a network of D.C. schools produced giants of American art,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/12/dc-black-arts-education/,"“A Bold and Beautiful Vision,” an exhibition at Anacostia Community Museum, traces the educators who made D.C. a thriving national home for Black artists.",2024-06-12T13:00:00Z,"The art room at Armstrong, one of D.C.’s first high schools for African American students, was “a beautiful place, just where I belonged.” So recalled a former student whose comment is placed at the opening of the Anacostia Community Museum’s “A Bold and Beautiful Vision: A Century of Black Arts Education in Washington, D.C., 1900-2000.” This particular memory belonged to Alma Thomas, who ultimately became a major artist and one of the city’s best-known Black painters. The 1911 Armstrong graduate is the ideal person to introduce this celebratory exhibition, since she was both an artist and an arts educator who taught for decades at Shaw Junior High School. The range of these schools and the talent they cultivated is striking. Such aspiring artists and performers as pianist Billy Taylor, sculptor and graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett, and flutist and printmaker Lloyd McNeill were nurtured by Dunbar High School, established in 1870, the nation’s first public high school for African American students. After the D.C. school system’s racial integration in 1954, Black students also attended McKinley Tech, which was originally the White equivalent to Armstrong. The Duke Ellington School of the Arts, named for an Armstrong alumnus, was established in 1974 and continues today. Considerably more ad hoc was the storefront school called the New Thing Art and Architecture Center, whose brief but prominent existence from 1966 to 1972 was the subject of a recent American University exhibition. At the college level, Howard University developed an influential art department, founded in 1921 as the first such unit at a historically Black college or university. Among the significant artists who taught at Howard were Loïs Mailou Jones and David C. Driskell. Miner Teachers College, later absorbed into the University of the District of Columbia, educated Alma Thomas (who also attended Howard) and poet Dolores Kendrick. All these institutions are spotlighted in “A Bold and Beautiful Vision,” which features photographs, artworks, posters, videos and a few artifacts. On display are Thomas’s brushes and watercolor-paint blocks, as well as a piano custom-built for operatic soprano Lillian Evanti, who graduated from Armstrong a few years before Thomas and studied at both Miner and Howard. The earliest figure in the narrative is Thomas W. Hunster, described by the show’s catalogue as the “forgotten founder of arts education in Washington.” The Ohio native stopped in D.C. in 1875 to earn some money before embarking on a planned trip to Paris. The superintendent of the city’s Black schools asked him to teach art here, and he ended up staying 50 years. Hunster taught at Dunbar and Miner, and Thomas was among his students. Three of his paintings, all from 1915, are included in the show. They’re extremely skillful and utterly traditional landscape oils that depict wild American scenes in a European style already outdated in Europe at the time. Hunster was clearly keen on being accepted by the mainstream art world, not in challenging it. That’s characteristic of the artworks in this show, nearly all of which are representational. The selection does include one significant modernist piece, a large wooden assemblage by Sam Gilliam, who didn’t attend D.C. schools but did work in them, teaching at McKinley from 1962 to 1967. “Daily Red” is a 1998 sculpture that furthers Gilliam’s project of expanding color-field painting to three dimensions, originally pursued with draped canvases. The sculpture’s brightly painted plywood components are punctuated by oval and circular cutouts that call attention to the way the piece occupies space — and to the open areas that remain unoccupied. The title, a play on “daily bread,” asserts that art is essential to human existence. Aside from Gilliam’s work, the show’s most memorable pictures chronicle everyday Black life and family connections, elementary subjects yet ones often threatened by White racism. Among the elegant Catlett prints are examples of the series “The Black Woman” and her “Two Generations,” which appears to depict a grandmother and child. James A. Porter, an Armstrong graduate, depicts the nation’s first Black YMCA in a large circa-1934 painting of the 12th Street NW facility. The show’s exemplary picture is by John N. Robinson, a D.C. native and junior high school dropout whose talents were later discovered, leading to lessons from Howard art professor James V. Herring. The painting, made circa 1980, neatly encapsulates the themes of family, art and education. Nine kids, the artist’s grandchildren, sit around a table, drawing and painting. Three hold up their artwork for Grandad’s inspection, and most are smiling. Perhaps none of the kids will grow up to be an acclaimed artist like Sam Gilliam, but they seem to share his sense that art is as fundamental as food. Anacostia Community Museum, 1901 Fort Pl.

51,Ty Burr,‘Brats’ sees the Brat Pack from the other side of the looking glass,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/06/13/brats-andrew-mccarthy-demi-moore-review/,Andrew McCarthy’s documentary is a star’s troubled reminiscence.,2024-06-13T10:00:59Z,"You know that one guy at the high school reunion who just won’t go home? Who’s still sitting there at the table under the tent at 1 a.m. hashing out old dramas and resentments? That’s Andrew McCarthy in “Brats,” a documentary he wrote and directed in which the actor rounds up his co-stars from 1980s teen movies to ask them if they were as upset as he was — is — about the Brat Pack label. And if not, well, why not? The movie, airing on Hulu, is a strange but worthy watch: cringey here, unexpectedly revelatory there, sincere and blinkered and articulate and dumb. McCarthy, now 61, is a slightly more wizened and concentrated version of his teenage self, his pale blue eyes still searching for reassurance. The cameras follow him with at times uncomfortable frankness as he dials up Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson, Rob Lowe and Jon Cryer, and asks them if he can come over and chat. I know many of us think these people all hang out at the same country club, but the truth is that McCarthy hasn’t seen most of them in 30 years. So, yes, he’s that guy, too, calling long-ago friends out of the blue to talk over the bad old days. It goes about as well as can be imagined. We hear that Ringwald would “rather look forward” and won’t be participating, and Nelson proves impossible to geolocate, but Estevez, Lowe, Cryer, Sheedy and Demi Moore welcome McCarthy into their homes and engage with him on the subject of being famous and too young to process it. (Who does and doesn’t qualify as a member gets a thorough chewing over at one point, and you’re forgiven if you think, say, Anthony Michael Hall has been done wrong.) What’s really chafing the filmmaker’s biscuits is the June 10, 1985, issue of New York magazine that introduced “the Brat Pack” — the actors, the phrase, the cultural meme — to a world that wholeheartedly adopted it and, in McCarthy’s view (and he’s not alone), diminished the individual talents and career options of every actor involved. “I suddenly felt that I wasn’t being seen,” he says of auditions in the immediate post-“Pretty in Pink” era. His former co-stars have adjusted better, and the conversations range from the therapeutic to sharp cultural analysis about why the Brat Pack happened and mattered. Estevez acknowledges that the phrase — journalist David Blum’s riff on the “Rat Pack” of Frank Sinatra’s Vegas era — “made us seem like lightweights” but also advises McCarthy that a label has only as much power as one is willing to give it. Sheedy recalls how her “Breakfast Club” character allowed her to come to terms with her own lonely adolescence but admits to feeling a “weird vibe” in auditions after the New York magazine article ran. Lea Thompson (who correctly identifies as “Brat Pack-adjacent”) points out that the new medium of VHS let teenagers watch movies like “Some Kind of Wonderful” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” over and over, giving them and their stars immense cultural power. Lowe is his unflappable self — “I get why it happened; there were just too many of us,” he says — and in the process reveals the truth of personality behind a given pop persona. And Moore, bless her, is that one friend who keeps talking sensibly and empathetically with McCarthy until she’s talked him off the ledge. For a while. The director also buttonholes “Pretty in Pink” director (and Thompson’s husband) Howard Deutch, “St. Elmo’s Fire” producer Lauren Shuler Donner, novelist Bret Easton Ellis, a film critic, a screenwriter, a casting agent, the author of a book on the Brat Pack and others, and he layers in a wealth of 1980s interview footage of the actors gamely trying to talk their way out of the corner into which the era painted them. It makes for intriguing if scattershot viewing, and when author and cultural critic Malcolm Gladwell tells McCarthy that he was always on Team Ducky — it’s a reference to “Pretty in Pink”; if you know, you know — you kind of feel the actor has it coming. And Gladwell’s point holds: The Brat Pack movies are still a rite of passage because they let young viewers identify with aspects of the characters in a way that helps them make sense of who they’re becoming. Still, “Brats” may not land the way its maker thinks, if only because people tend to not have a lot of sympathy for the complaints of perceived celebrities. They probably should. As someone who has interviewed a great many actors and directors over the years, I’ve been witness to the infinite variety, individuality, insecurity and common human decency of the so-called movie star. The yutzes — the actual brats — are exceptions to the rule. Actors are people who are very good at inventing other selves, and sometimes they’re less skilled at feeling comfortable in their own skins. In its earnest, haphazard way, “Brats” testifies to this. The Brat Pack remains a surprisingly rich cultural concept — Would “Friends” exist without it? Why is Tom Cruise not considered a member? Discuss. — but it eroded at least one actor’s sense of self in a way that’s still eating at him four decades on. Unrated. Available on Hulu. Contains language and substance use. 93 minutes.

With the onset of puberty, Riley’s five original emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger — are joined by Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment and Ennui. Things get messy fast, and Joy (Amy Poehler) and company embark on another adventure through Riley’s mind featuring scenes of suspense and peril (storms, falls from heights, dynamite blasts, chases, etc.). Now that Anxiety (Maya Hawke) is in control, Riley’s fears as a teen are more about saying or doing the wrong thing. Which she does, often. But learning from your mistakes is one of the movie’s key messages, along with the idea that loving someone means loving all of them — including their imperfections — and that you can’t always prevent hard times. Language is limited to a couple of uses of words like “jerk” and “moron” (plus Joy’s frustrated exclamation of “Jiminy mother-loving toaster strudel”). Most of the content is appropriate for elementary-schoolers and up, but younger kids may need a bit more explanation. (96 minutes) Available in theaters. Streaming Beloved animated character learns life lessons, faces danger. “Ultraman: Rising” is a Tokyo-set animated movie about a Japanese American baseball star and reluctant superhero named Ken Sato (voiced by Christopher Sean), who learns humility, teamwork and gratitude while caring for a creature. Other — mostly male — characters display similar traits while caring for their families. Ken regularly does battle as Ultraman in scenes involving falls, crashes, weapons, fire, broken bones and destruction. Characters (including a baby and an elderly man) end up in harm’s way, a mother goes missing, a child is bullied for being different, and at least one character is killed. The film includes some of the local customs, sights and cultural products of Tokyo. Mild language includes “hell,” “crap,” “suck,” “heck,” “fart” and “poopy.” (117 minutes) Available on Netflix. Magic school sequel adds tween romance and bullying. “School of Magical Animals 2” is a German fantasy adventure film based on a book series. The sequel is skewed toward a slightly older audience, with a focus on the romance of tween protagonists Ida (Emilia Maier) and Jo (Loris Sichrovsky). Jo’s talking penguin has a macho attitude and calls girls “chicks” and “hot.” A key storyline focuses on the bully Helene (Emilia Pieske) and her gang of “Mean Girls”-like characters (the 2004 movie is directly referenced). But most of the characters are kind, encouraging and fair. A mystery with a cloaked figure digging up the street at night adds some adventure, with very mild peril. The movie was filmed in German, and an English-dubbed version is available. (103 minutes) Available in theaters. Streaming Peanuts gang has summer fun and some Lucy and Snoopy snark. “Camp Snoopy” is a series that follows the Peanuts gang to summer camp. As in other Peanuts tales, expect some meanness from Lucy (voiced by Isabella Leo), anger from Snoopy (Terry McGurrin) and lack of self-esteem from Charlie Brown (Etienne Kellici). There are also slapstick bumps and bruises, plus arguments and mild insults (“ridiculous,” etc.). Some storylines touch on slightly more mature topics, such as a crush between characters and a camper’s homesickness. (10 episodes) Available on Apple TV Plus.

It’s more of the same, so if you were a fan of the other movies, you’ll probably like this one. It has all the violence you’d expect and more, including gunshots, blood spurts, slicing, stabbing, chases, crashes, fires, alligator attacks and a brief image of torture. Near-constant language includes “f---,” “s---,” “motherf----r,” “bulls---,” “son of a b----,” “a--” and “damn.” The movie also features sex-related dialogue, sexual gestures, scantily clad men and women, a brief glimpse of a man’s bare buttocks, and kissing. Ecstasy and cocaine are mentioned, and a character drinks whiskey. (115 minutes) Available in theaters. Streaming Star Wars murder mystery has violence and some language. “The Acolyte” is a Star Wars show that’s loosely structured around a murder mystery. This series, which takes place about 100 years before the prequel movies, features elaborate, martial arts-inspired fight scenes. Violence and profanity are a notch above what’s typical for the Star Wars franchise, but the series is fairly restrained in their usage: There are violent deaths but no gore, and language is limited to “damn,” “a--” and the like. Characters appear to drink in cantinas. Expect themes about compassion, integrity and teamwork. (Eight episodes) Available on Disney Plus. Streaming Twisty thriller-comedy has sex, language and violence. Director Richard Linklater’s thriller-comedy “Hit Man” centers on a police contractor named Gary (Glen Powell) who is posing as an assassin. People — including a teen — hire him to commit murder. There is lots of discussion about bodily harm, but little is shown beyond one death by poison and suffocation. One character pulls a gun, and archive footage includes scenes of violence from old movies and TV shows. Gary invents descriptions of how he kills, dismembers and disposes of people’s bodies, and he describes specific methods people might use to die via suicide. Two characters kiss and have sex. Adults drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes. A police officer drinks from a flask while on duty, and a person is drugged into unconsciousness. Language includes “f---,” “s---,” “a--hole,” “goddamn,” “hell,” “b----,” “sucks” and more. The female lead (played by Puerto Rico native Adria Arjona) could be considered a stereotype of the intense, sexy Latina; her character isn’t given many interests or much purpose outside of the men in her life. There are also stereotypes of lower-income White Southerners, including one gun rights advocate. (115 minutes) Available on Netflix. Streaming Light scares as quirky Green family takes cosmic road trip. “Big City Greens the Movie: Spacecation” is a comedic musical movie in which characters from the show “Big City Greens” (voiced by veteran cast members Chris Houghton, Marieve Herington and Bob Joles) take an unexpectedly cosmic “road trip.” It’s jam-packed with all the elements that the series’s fans love: quirky family dynamics, mischief, adventure and a unique sense of humor. There are also moments of danger, including confinement and sharp weapons. But it’s definitely all on the mild side, and themes include space adventure, teamwork and quality family time.

54,Mark Jenkins,Sarah Shook and the Disarmers came all this way on their own,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/12/sarah-shook-concert-dc/,The alt-country band will perform on June 15 at 8 p.m. at Songbyrd Music House.,2024-06-12T14:00:30Z,"Naming is complicated for Sarah Shook and the Disarmers. “I wanted to pick a name that didn’t really seem like it would be a country band,” says Shook of adopting the tag “Disarmers” in 2014. “I liked the irony of that.” As for the name Sarah, Shook has actually been called River since late 2020 but hasn’t definitively decided to update the group’s handle. A nonbinary bisexual who uses they/them pronouns, the alt-country singer, songwriter and guitarist expects to be billed professionally as River “at some point,” they say by phone from North Carolina. Almost two decades ago, a 19-year-old Shook moved from Upstate New York to North Carolina with their parents, who had limited their children to only Christian and classical music. “When I started writing songs, I didn’t even really have words for what genres I was working in,” the musician recalls. “In my early 20s, I heard country music for the first time. And I had this feeling of recognition. I was like, ‘What is this? Because this is something that I’m doing.’” The new “Revelations” is the most acclaimed of Shook and the Disarmers’ four albums. Joined by guitarist Blake J. Tallent and drummer Jack Foster — bassist Mason Thomas and pedal-steel player Evan Phillips enlisted after the album was recorded — Shook sweetens “Give You All My Love” with a pretty chorus but bashes out defiant broadsides such as “You Don’t Get to Tell Me.” As Shook proclaims in the latter song, “I came all this way on my own.” The song “is pretty layered and came from a lot of different feelings about Christianity and religion and gender identity,” they say. Shook quit a lot of things along the way: meat and dairy, their parents’ fundamentalist creed, and alcohol. “I’ll be sober five years in July,” they say. “It’s incredible.” “I used alcohol for well over a decade to run from myself and aspects of myself I didn’t understand. And to run from the past and religious trauma and abusive relationships.” “For me, it was never enough to say that sobriety isn’t drinking,” they continue. “Sobriety is about facing all of my demons, getting my [stuff] together, figuring out who I am and then approaching life from this more poised and organized place.” Before “Revelations,” Shook’s most recent project was a 2022 alt-rock album, credited to Mightmare, on which the musician played everything but a few bass parts. “That was my first foray into production. Obviously a very different animal. It was just me,” they note. “It showed me I was able to make good decisions in the studio.” That project led Shook to tackle the production duties for the latest Disarmers release. Rejecting the high-tech strategies of a previous producer, Shook recorded the band live and didn’t Auto-Tune the vocals. “I didn’t want to work with someone who didn’t know how to interpret or mix my voice,” they explain. “Making sure that I sounded like me was really important.” “One of things I really like about my voice is that it’s not perfect. It can be scratchy. There are times that I’m flat; there are times that I’m sharp. “But I never set out to be a great singer, just like I never set out to be a great guitar player,” Shook says. “Songwriting is everything, and I just happen to have to do those other things to get my songs out into the world.”  June 15 at 8 p.m. at Songbyrd Music House, 540 Penn St. NE. songbyrddc.com. $15-$18."

Bands such as No Doubt, the Violent Femmes and the Ramones filled RFK Stadium with electric sounds and screaming fans. By the mid-’90s, attendance was over 50,000, with tickets selling out in less than two hours. Now, I.M.P., the parent company of 9:30 Club, is bringing the nostalgia-laced bands of yore (the ’90s and 2000s) to Nationals Park. When it staged revived HFStivals at Merriweather Post Pavilion in 2010 and 2011, it leaned heavily on ’90s-era lineups, and this year’s is no different. Here’s who is coming to HFStival 2024: HFStival veterans will note that this is the first time that the festival has had a single stage since 1993 — after which it featured as many as four, including a dance tent — and the first time since 1990 that no local bands have featured on the announced lineup. (Was Jimmie’s Chicken Shack unavailable?) In a statement to The Washington Post, Jen Hass, I.M.P.’s co-director of booking, said that “HFStival represents such a nostalgic moment in time for so many people. The fest was always known for leaning heavily into rock, … but then you’d see Coldplay or Jewel or Tony Bennett grace the lineup as well. … We wanted to bring together bands that were a part of the original HFStival, as well as ones that never got the chance to play but have gone on to build legacy careers — all for one day on one stage.” As with last year’s initial lineup of concerts at the Atlantis, tickets will be sold through a lottery system in which hopeful headbangers will request tickets, enter their payment information (which will be charged only if their request is successful), and find out whether they are lucky enough to secure tickets. Be prepared for sticker shock: Standing room in the pit in front of the stage costs $250 plus service charges. Reserved seats on the field or in the lower stands cost $250 plus fees; seats in the upper levels or the side of the stage are $150 plus fees. VIP tickets, which cost $475 each and must be requested in pairs, include complimentary draft beer and “ballpark fare,” plus access to exclusive areas, including VIP restrooms, air conditioning and the “Dugout Lounge,” located in the baseball dugouts, as well as a T-shirt and other swag. (For comparison, in 2004, the final year at RFK Stadium, tickets sold through Ticketmaster for $40 plus fees.) Ticket requests must be submitted by June 16 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern, with confirmation emails to be sent out on the evening of June 21. Fritz Hahn contributed to this report."
56,Amy Nicholson,"‘Inside Out 2’: Once more, with more feelings",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/06/12/inside-out-2-amy-poehler-review/,It’s puberty blues as Anxiety (that’s Maya Hawke) threatens to eclipse Joy (Amy Poehler) in Pixar’s “Inside Out 2.”,2024-06-12T19:05:00Z,"Anxiety is the dominant emotion in Pixar’s “Inside Out 2,” and one can empathize with director Kelsey Mann for having it on the brain. Being in charge of following up the beloved 2015 Oscar winner would give anyone a panic attack. The kids who grew up with the original cartoon about a young girl named Riley (then voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), whose ponytailed body is an exoskeleton for psychological spelunking, are now getting their mental health advice from influencers on TikTok. Anxiety is the dominant emotion there, too — a catchall for the pressures of modern life — although the idea of personifying anxiety goes back to the ancient Greeks, who deemed her the deadly daughter of night. In this clever if inessential sequel, Anxiety (Maya Hawke) is a frazzled thing with a mouth wide enough to chug five energy drinks in one gulp. The pretext for her arrival is that Riley (now voiced by Kensington Tallman) has started puberty, triggering panic among her core emotions Joy (Amy Poehler), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Tony Hale), Disgust (Liza Lapira) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith), the simplistic feelings that adults tend to suppress until they’re dredged up in therapy. Disappointingly, the film’s PG rating keeps the two sensations we’d be most curious to see get a dusting of Disney magic — PMS and Libido — from crashing Riley’s hormonal rager. (We do get a glimpse of the girl’s Mount Crushmore, which stars a video game character with a pixelated six-pack — i.e., a hunk without dangerous hormones of his own.) Instead, screenwriters Meg LeFauve (who co-wrote the original movie with Josh Cooley and Pete Docter) and Dave Holstein clutter the screen with redundant feelings — Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) — who don’t add much to the saga of Riley’s three disastrous days at an all-girls hockey camp. As the painfully self-conscious 13-year-old claws out of her newly pimpled skin in her desperation to impress her coach (Yvette Nicole Brown) and older, cooler teammates, Anxiety exiles Joy and the gang and declares that she alone can save things with her advanced simulators that project increasingly disastrous future scenarios, one of which results in Riley dying alone, like, forever. Only Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), lounging about with a snooty French accent, cuts through the noise by acting uninterested in the whole thing. Design-wise, the “Inside Out” characters are Pixar’s crudest work, with the blocky colors and stiff hair of a creature in a TV commercial for insecticide. Blown up to the big screen, they just look worse. Narratively, however, the film’s portrait of Joy is beautifully complex. A zealot for bliss, she’s the embodiment of self-help books that scold readers to get over their miseries and just lean in until they plop onto the CEO’s chair, and of the nine out of 10 family films that patronize children with wax maxims to simply believe in themselves. So it felt like kiddie Joan Didion when the first “Inside Out” got Joy to concede that life is allowed to feel both happy and sad. (My own therapist and I are still working on that.) The sequel can’t offer any wisdom that profound, but it bolsters its warts-and-all humanism with Joy’s challenge to accept that Riley can be both good and bad, a compassionate pal who’s also a puck-hogging, status-seeking snob. The film is on its own quest for an identity. If it can’t be innovative, it’ll settle for being relatable. Riley’s attempt to vault from one friend group to another is agonizingly well-sketched, particularly for audiences who remember the Romanov-level palace intrigue about where to sit at lunch. As the story skips from one tenuous pun to another, representing the gulf between what one says and what one means as a yawning sar-chasm, it takes care to serve up a few scene-stealing merchandising opp — er, I mean, bit players — found in the recesses of Riley’s memory vault. These include Pouchy (James Austin Johnson), a talking fanny pack, and Nostalgia (June Squibb), an elderly lady who, in a fun runner, keeps doddering into Riley’s brain ahead of schedule. Nostalgia might not sell many of her own toys, but if our own neurons are willing to get honest, she’s the main thing this sequel flogs. PG. At area theaters. Contains some thematic elements. 96 minutes."
57,Michael O'Sullivan,‘Firebrand’: Revisionist feminist take on the last wife of Henry VIII,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/06/14/firebrand-movie-henry-viii-review/,Alicia Vikander and Jude Law star in the counterfactual Tudor drama “Firebrand.”,2024-06-14T10:00:03Z,"Set in 1546, “Firebrand” opens with a fairy-tale-like intro delivered by a teenage Princess Elizabeth (Junia Rees): “In a rotten, blood-soaked island kingdom, cursed by plague and riven by religious unrest, there once was a queen by the name of Katherine Parr.” That much is true, if perhaps hyperbolic in its grim assessment of 16th-century England. Throughout the film, this queen to be, daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, the beheaded Anne Boleyn, seems to watch and wait in the wings for her own ascendancy to the throne 13 years later. This is no origin story, however. The virgin queen is not the subject of this ahistoric Tudor drama, which plays so fast and loose with the facts at times that the narrator should be taken only as the most unreliable of witnesses. Katherine, the sixth and last wife of King Henry (Jude Law), who survived her notoriously fickle — even violently mercurial — husband, is the putative firebrand. The choice of title is a strange one. Played by an equally watchful and waiting — almost inert — Alicia Vikander, Katherine is, for much of the film, something of a fizzling cipher as she patiently endures indignities at the hands of her husband. Fire does figure prominently elsewhere: in the burning of plague-infected garments, banned books and, at times, Protestants accused of heresy against the Church of England. But the only traditional incendiaries in the story are the radical Protestant preacher Anne Askew (Erin Doherty), a friend of Katherine’s, and Henry’s minion, Bishop Stephen Gardiner, played by an inquisitorial Simon Russell Beale. “I know what you are capable of,” Anne tells Katherine, after the queen has secretly visited her against the wishes of Henry, head of the Church of England, and Gardiner, who keeps a gimlet eye on those who would go too far in challenging orthodoxy in Reformation-era Britain. Anne may know what Katherine is capable of. We, on the other hand, are made to wait until the end to learn just what the character is all about. Her emergence as a heroine worthy of a 21st-century audience is a doozy, one you won’t find in any history book. It is, however, the premise of Elizabeth Fremantle’s 2013 novel, “Queen’s Gambit,” from which this revisionist feminist take on Tudor court drama has been adapted by screenwriting sisters Henrietta and Jessica Ashworth (with additional writing by Rosanne Flynn) and directed by Karim Ainouz (“Invisible Life”). Ainouz captures the look and feel of the time, with sumptuous costumes by Michael O’Connor and handsome production design by Helen Scott. The central, quasi-Shakespearean intrigue — which revolves around Katherine’s potential exposure as a co-conspirator of Askew — is also handled adroitly, even if many of the scenes simply feature Henry’s gratuitously cruel efforts to humiliate Katherine. He forces her to taste his food at a public dinner, presumably for poison. Other scenes show him sticking his fingers lasciviously deep into Katherine’s mouth; openly flirting with a prospective mistress; and accusing Katherine of infidelity with Thomas Seymour (Sam Riley), a former lover as Fremantle’s book has it, whom Katherine would in fact go on to marry after Henry’s death. There’s also a scene that borders on sexual assault, and another in which Katherine is made to change the pus-soaked bandages on her husband’s ulcerating leg wound, the result of a 10-year-old jousting injury. At times like these, and when we watch Henry’s bare bum writhing atop Katherine during joyless sex, Ainouz seems to enjoy torturing us almost as much as Henry does Katherine. But at least Law fills the screen with energy, reveling in Henry’s malignant narcissism with a mesmerizing, maniacal sadism. One wishes to see the titular firebrand stand up to his suppurating cruelty much sooner than she eventually does. “There is more than one way to scorch the earth,” Elizabeth cautions us late in the film, presumably by way of explaining why we’ve been made to bide so much time without an emotional payoff. A kind of satisfaction ultimately arrives, but it is not one for purists, or even lovers of speculative history. It feels tacked on: too little, too late, too ludicrous — the past rewritten as a form of wishful thinking. R. At AMC’s Hoffman Center 22 and Rio Cinemas 18. Contains violence, brief gory images and shots of ugly wounds, sexuality, nudity, and mature thematic elements. 120 minutes."
58,George F. Will,Questions for the Biden-Trump ‘debate’ that might be useful,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/14/questions-biden-trump-debate/,"Let’s find out where the candidates stand on entitlements, protectionism, the Constitution and other matters.",2024-06-14T20:49:28Z,"The Joe Biden-Donald Trump collisions, although dignified as “debates,” are dark alleys where the remnants of America’s political dignity are mugged by both participants. Voters might, however, glean useful information if certain questions are asked on June 27. The Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted by 2033. Under current law, benefits then will be reduced 21 percent. The Biden-Trump consensus includes vowing not to diminish the entitlements (Social Security, Medicare) that are producing deficits that just added $1 trillion to the national debt in eight months. Would you favor a multitrillion-dollar tweak: infusing Social Security with more borrowing, meaning debt? (Tax revenue is insufficient to cover the other government expenditures.) If not that solution, what? The Biden-Trump consensus encompasses protectionism (you, President Biden, have intensified Mr. Trump’s), which is industrial policy — government management of the economy, picking economic winners and losers. Because communities and industries become dependent on protection, is it forever? The Biden-Trump consensus includes impatience with the Constitution. Mr. Trump, when Congress refused to fund your border wall, you “repurposed” money Congress had appropriated for other uses. And you reportedly plan to claim a presidential power to impound appropriated funds when you dislike Congress’s choices. President Biden, you tried to spend, unilaterally, more than $400 billion on student debt forgiveness, and when the Supreme Court said this violated Congress’s constitutional prerogatives under the appropriations clause, you said, “The Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt, but they didn’t stop me.” What other constitutional requirements do you two consider flimsy legal cobwebs? President Biden, twice you have expressed a U.S. commitment to the military defense of an attacked Taiwan. Twice your underlings “clarified” your remarks to restore ambiguity. Should not a commitment so momentous be made by Congress? Would either of you favor a congressional declaration making the commitment explicit? Mr. Trump, you say that if you are elected, Russia’s war against Ukraine will be “solved” in “24 hours.” How, without validating George Orwell’s axiom that the quickest way to end a war is to lose it? Would you, President Biden, agree that the minimal criterion of not losing is restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty over all territory it controlled before Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion? President Biden, during your 36 Senate years, both parties embraced the filibuster as now practiced, requiring 60 votes to pass significant legislation. If you are reelected and Democrats control the Senate, would you favor abolishing the filibuster? Mr. Trump, if you are elected and Republicans control the Senate, will you use their canine loyalty to speed enactment of your agenda by abolishing the filibuster? Mr. Trump, there are 10.5 million (down from 12.2 million in 2007) illegal immigrants. According to the Migration Policy Institute, 62 percent have been here at least 10 years, 22 percent at least 20 years, 21 percent for less than five years. Twenty-eight percent own their homes. Do you favor deporting them? Might this reduction of the workforce, during full employment, injure America? Describe the police measures necessary for expelling a cohort larger than Michigan’s population. President Biden, are nine Supreme Court justices enough? You favor statehood for the District of Columbia. Do you agree that, given the 23rd Amendment, statehood would require a constitutional amendment? Do you know that only 16 states ratified (38 are required) such an amendment proposed in 1978? In World War II, the United States pursued “unconditional surrender” of the Axis powers by, among other measures, “dehousing” Germans and Japanese — bombing urban residential areas. Do either of you think Israel’s goal of destroying Hamas less defensible than was “unconditional surrender”? Are Israel’s military measures more disproportionate or indiscriminate than U.S. tactics were? President Biden, the armed services are experiencing serious enlistment shortfalls. Could this be a consequence of schools teaching that the nation is systemically racist, hostile to “equity” and not worth defending? Mr. Trump, the 2017 tax cuts you signed will expire next year. Extending them would, the Congressional Budget Office says, have a 10-year lost-revenue cost of $3.9 trillion ($4.5 trillion including servicing the debt increase). Worrisome? But, President Biden, expiration of the $10,000 per filer cap on deducting state and local taxes, disproportionately paid by blue-state and Biden voters, would raise $1.2 trillion. Copacetic? President Biden, you say our democracy hangs by a thread, that you are the thread, and that Mr. Trump is a pair of scissors in human form. How exactly do you envision Mr. Trump destroying democracy — canceling elections, scrapping the Constitution, neutering the judiciary? See you again on Sept. 10."
59,Aaron Blake,"GOP overwhelmingly supports a Trump conspiracy theory, yet again",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/10/gop-overwhelmingly-supports-trump-conspiracy-theory-yet-again/,"There remains no evidence that Biden was behind the Manhattan prosecution of the former president, but 80 percent of Republicans say otherwise.",2024-06-10T15:17:32Z,"Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Donald Trump is unhappy about the outcome of a proceeding. So despite a complete lack of evidence, he spends months claiming a concerted conspiracy against him, masterminded by his nefarious political opponents. He says this many dozens of times, despite firm denials from key figures and even some Trump allies. And by the end of it, 4 in 10 Americans come to believe in the vast left-wing conspiracy. It happened with the idea that the 2020 election was stolen. It’s now apparently happened with the idea that President Biden was behind Trump’s recent conviction in Manhattan. A new CBS News-YouGov poll gets at a question I’ve been hoping someone would ask for a while. It gauged just how many Americans buy into the baseless idea that Biden had something to do with the successful charges against Trump in Manhattan. Turns out, it’s 43 percent — and 80 percent of Republicans. Those are the percentages who agree that the charges were brought because of “directions that came from the Biden administration,” rather than merely by “prosecutors in New York.” A clear majority of Americans, 57 percent, don’t believe this. But the idea has taken hold in Trump’s base. To be clear, there is no real reason to believe this. The theory largely rests on the fact that former top Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo joined the investigation in 2022. But Colangelo had previously worked alongside Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) in the New York attorney general’s office, where he had worked on Trump-related investigations. It’s about as circumstantial and speculative as you can get. Attorney General Merrick Garland last week firmly denied, under oath, that he had sent Colangelo to Manhattan. He denied any contact with Colangelo since he joined the DA’s office. Beyond that, this theory was also firmly rejected in recent weeks by no less than former Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina, who worked on Trump’s defense early in the Manhattan prosecution. He called the idea “silly” and “ridiculous.” “Joe Biden or anyone from his Justice Department has absolutely zero to do with the Manhattan district attorney office,” Tacopina said in an MSNBC interview, adding, “We know that’s not the case, and even Trump’s lawyers know that’s not the case.” “People who say that,” Tacopina told MSNBC, “it’s scary that they really don’t know the law or what they’re talking about.” By Tacopina’s formulation, 4 in 10 Americans have no idea what they’re talking about. Of course, it wouldn’t be the first time Trump’s base has come to believe something like this, despite a lack of evidence: Voters often come to believe wacky things that excuse their allies and implicate their foes. But the degree to which these things have become articles of faith on the right — literally — bears no modern precedent. And the similarities between the Biden-Manhattan theory and the “stolen election” fever go well beyond the surface level. Republican lawmakers don’t go as far as Trump in alleging an established conspiracy, but they do make a point to seed suspicion. Trump will say there are millions of fraudulent votes; they merely raise concerns about mail ballots and election procedures. He will say Biden was behind the Manhattan prosecution; they will merely raise questions about Colangelo. Even at last week’s hearing with Garland, though, Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) briefly conceded that this was a mere theory. “You might not have had anything to do with that,” Fry told Garland, “but the perception is and the American people perceive that the Department of Justice is intimately engaged with this.” We now have a number we can attach to that perception: 43 percent. It’s just that, as with so many of the above numbers, it’s largely based on one piece of highly circumstantial and dubious evidence: Trump said so."
60,Aaron Blake,"The pros, cons and odds for 8 Trump VP contenders",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/07/pros-cons-odds-8-trump-vp-contenders/,"Looking at each candidate’s biggest attributes and drawbacks, now that we have some clarity on who’s in the running.",2024-06-07T18:04:36Z,"In a little over a month, former president Donald Trump is due to make his final decision about who will appear on the 2024 ballot with him. By the mid-July Republican National Convention, he’ll have to settle on a running mate to replace former vice president Mike Pence. The pick could come sooner. We now actually have some real hints as to whom it might be. The Washington Post’s Marianne LeVine reports that the Trump campaign has sought documents from at least eight potential running mates. That doesn’t mean this is his final shortlist. Things can change, and that’s especially the case when the decision rests with a man as volatile as Trump. But it does suggest that these are some front-runners. So now that we’ve got something firmer to grab hold of, let’s do a quick run-down of who these eight are and what they could — and wouldn’t — bring to the ticket. Biggest attribute: While Rubio has never realized his potential as the onetime supposed “Republican savior,” there is a reason he earned such hype earlier in his career. He exemplifies what the party has aspired to be — relatively young, diverse, telegenic and a talented messenger who can sell the brand. Perhaps as much as anyone on this list, picking him could be an olive branch to the types of voters who wanted Nikki Haley as the 2024 nominee — and stuck by her long after she dropped out. (Haley herself appears to be off the table.) Biggest drawback: While Trump has proven he can mend fences with people who once criticized him, he and Rubio said some really ugly things about each other in 2016. Imagine Democrats running ads featuring Trump’s running mate calling Trump a “con artist.” Also, either Trump or Rubio would have to establish residency outside of Florida, because the Constitution bars two candidates from the same state from winning that state’s electoral votes. Rubio is an incumbent senator in Florida; would Trump really move for him? It’s apparently an issue. Betting line: A strong possibility, if they can work that out. Biggest attribute: Vance appears to be the most in line with Trump’s brand of politics — the populism, the election denialism, the baseless claims of Trump’s legal persecution, and the noninterventionist foreign policy. And he could seemingly sell that vision. While once a Trump critic, Vance literally wrote the book on what animates Trump’s base. Biggest drawback: If Trump is looking for electoral help, it’s not clear Vance provides it. Despite winning his Senate seat in 2022, voters were far from enamored of him. He underperformed Trump’s margins in that state, and he way underperformed the other statewide Republicans who were on the ballot with him. You’d think the Trump campaign might ask why that is. Betting line: About as strong as Rubio. Biggest attribute: Cotton, like Rubio, has long been thought of as the future of a more traditionally conservative Republican Party. He’s just 47, a decorated combat veteran and a longtime member of Congress with a significant foreign policy portfolio. Biggest drawback: That foreign policy portfolio is clearly more hawkish than Trump’s. Cotton also pretty strongly condemned Trump and election denialism shortly after Jan. 6. “It’s past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence,” Cotton said at the time. Betting line: It’s tough to see how Trump looks past the Jan. 6 stuff, given how central that is to him. Biggest attribute: Scott might be the most pragmatic pick — a Black senator who has a good reputation with pretty much all segments of the party. And while Scott is not really a MAGA politician, Trump has expressed enthusiasm about his talents as a sidekick. “I thought Tim Scott didn’t run as good of a race as he’s capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he’s unbelievable,” Trump has said. Biggest drawback: While perhaps the biggest do-no-harm pick, Scott did not acquit himself well as a 2024 candidate in his own right, gaining little traction. The stage seemed a lot bigger than he was. Maybe that matters less as a running mate, but Trump seems to be conscious of it. Betting line: On Rubio’s and Vance’s level. Biggest attribute: Trump and Burgum appear to have great chemistry, as LeVine reports. Even as Trump has called Vance and Rubio “great,” he called Burgum “incredible.” Burgum also has enormous personal wealth — he spent $28,000 of his own money per vote on his 2024 campaign — and the ability to connect Trump with his rich allies. Biggest drawback: Burgum is surely the most boring and unremarkable candidate on this list. It’s pretty much the opposite of an exciting pick, and Trump is someone who values stage presence and charisma (as long as he doesn’t get upstaged). Betting line: The most compelling sleeper pick, but still a sleeper pick. He makes a lot more sense for a Cabinet role. Biggest attribute: Stefanik could be the leading option if Trump wants to pick a female running mate — given how things have turned out with Haley and how Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake’s stock has fallen. (Former Trump White House spokeswoman and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has also been mentioned.) She’s also young (39) and a member of House GOP leadership who could serve as a bridge between Trump and Congress. Biggest drawback: While many on this list have evolved on Trump, Stefanik has undergone a personal transformation that makes her virtually unrecognizable compared with when she first came into Congress as a relatively moderate, establishment Republican not long ago. She says all the right, pro-Trump things these days. But you have to wonder whether Trump might worry that she could turn out to be another Pence. Betting line: A bit more than a sleeper pick. Biggest attribute: Donalds, like Scott, could help Trump appeal to Black voters, who are flirting with voting for the GOP presidential nominee as never before in modern presidential politics. He’s also someone with appeal that stretches from establishment Republicans to House Freedom Caucus types, as evidenced by the (limited) support he got to become House speaker. Biggest drawback: He’s the most inexperienced candidate on this list, having served just four years in the Florida Capitol and less than four years in the U.S. House — not even statewide office. He also has past legal problems from when he was a young adult, including a drug-possession charge and a bribery charge. He took part in a diversion program for the first and had the latter expunged. And then there is, of course, the same Florida residency problem as exists with Rubio. Betting line: While perhaps an unthinkable pick for a candidate not named Trump, a Donald-Donalds ticket checks some boxes and shouldn’t be totally discounted. Biggest attribute: He and Trump have been simpatico for a very long time, after some brief skirmishes during the 2016 campaign. Trump could view him as someone with potentially unmatched appeal to evangelical and Black voters, given his personal story of rising to become a famous neurosurgeon. Biggest drawback: Carson has been relatively quiet for a long time, and his tenure in Trump’s Cabinet was unremarkable. He got some traction while running for president in 2016, but his sleepy style isn’t really in line with Trump and might not play as well on a bigger national stage. Betting line: I’m pretty skeptical about this one."
61,Aaron Blake,"Democrats’ surprisingly close Ohio special election loss, in context",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/12/ohio-special-election-rulli-kripchak/,"Democrat Michael Kripchak lost by less than 10 points in a district Donald Trump carried by 29 in 2020. It’s merely the latest Democratic over-performance, but what does it mean?",2024-06-12T14:30:11Z,"Democrats continue to confront a confusing 2024 election picture. The polls keep showing President Biden struggling in the presidential race, but other signs — actual elections, for example — keep pointing in a more encouraging direction. High on that list is how Democrats have done in special elections. A case in point: Tuesday’s sleepy special in Ohio’s 6th District. While virtually nobody paid attention to the race, unheralded and underfunded Democrat Michael Kripchak was losing by less than 10 points in a district that Biden lost in 2020 by 29 points. For a time Tuesday night, it appeared as though it could have been even closer. Democrats have over-performed in special elections throughout the 2023-2024 election cycle, but this House race was one of the biggest swings to date. As for what it actually could mean? Some context is in order. Republican state Sen. Michael Rulli, now representative-elect, outspent Kripchak, a former research physicist in the military who most recently worked as a waiter, $571,000 to about $7,000 as of May 22, according to campaign finance reports. Outside groups including the national parties basically ignored the district because it had been uncompetitive in recent presidential elections. Despite its redness, this eastern Ohio district is unusual. As Kyle Kondik of the Crystal Ball has noted, the current version of it actually would have gone for Barack Obama by nearly eight points in 2008. So it swung about 37 points in presidential elections between 2008 and 2020. None of the country’s 434 other congressional districts featured a bigger swing toward Republican presidential candidates over those 12 years. On the one hand, it’s gone very red. On the other, it has been far less red relatively recently. And it’s difficult to apply any lessons here to many other districts. While the result was surprisingly close, it came with very low turnout. The results show just shy of 60,000 votes, with 98 percent of the expected vote counted. That’s less than 20 percent of the votes cast in the district in the 2020 presidential race. Turnout was about half of what it was in the primaries for the same seat, which were held alongside presidential primaries back in March. The contest drew just over a third of the turnout in the hotly contested special election in New York’s 3rd Congressional District in February. Big swings are significantly more common in special elections with lower turnout, like this one. Those caveats aside, this result was just the latest encouraging sign for Democrats. According to data crunched by Daily Kos Elections, the 19-point over-performance is the biggest thus far across six Republican vs. Democrat special congressional elections this cycle. Democrats have over-performed Biden’s 2020 showing in four of those six races, including three times by double digits. Republicans have over-performed in just one race, in Utah. The sixth race was the New York one, where the results closely matched the 2020 presidential race. But Democrats swung the results by double digits from the 2022 race for the same seat and flipped the seat blue. While Democrats hailed the results Tuesday night and have been encouraged by both the New York result and another big recent over-performance in a competitive Pennsylvania state House district, their advantage in such races has shrunk this year. The Daily Kos Elections data show Democrats over-performed the 2020 presidential results in congressional and state legislative elections by an average of 5.2 points in 2023, but that has shrunk to just 1.2 points in 2024. At the same time, they’re over-performing relative to a 2020 election that they won. And they’ve over-performed it in seven of the past eight special elections. Democrats also have other recent elections to cheer them — ones with much higher profiles than the Ohio special election. In addition to flipping the New York congressional seat, they won a crucial Wisconsin state Supreme Court race, and abortion rights continued to be a big winner on the ballot in Ohio in November. Performing well in non-regular elections is usually a good sign for a party. But we’re also in unusual times, in which the Republican Party has become remarkably reliant on voters who simply don’t turn out as much when Donald Trump isn’t on the ballot. Those more casual and infrequent voters are much more likely to vote in the presidential election. The question is how many of them do — and whether these special elections betray an enthusiasm gap that could cost Republicans."
62,Aaron Blake,The continued political march of abortion rights,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/13/continued-political-march-abortion-rights/,"As the Supreme Court declines to limit access to mifepristone, some striking new data shows Americans trending even more toward abortion rights.",2024-06-13T20:44:56Z,"The Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling Thursday rejecting an effort to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone is unlikely to reverberate too much politically. The impact would have been greater if the court had gone the other way, by restricting something Americans support nearly 2-to-1. Such a decision would have come just two years after the court’s highly unpopular decision overturning Roe v. Wade and could have set off a whole new backlash. But the ruling does serve as a reminder of how abortion rights — and specifically, how far Republicans and conservatives want to go in restricting them — could loom over 2024. Donald Trump is scrupulously avoiding these issues, including blowing his own deadline for offering a position on mifepristone. But Democrats are likely to raise them early and often in the campaign, and true believers in the antiabortion movement are plotting how to get Trump in line. The question has long been how much this issue would continue to help Democrats, as it clearly has in recent elections. And even as the Supreme Court was ruling this week came new data showing how the issue of abortion is still animating voters. It may even be animating them more than before. Whether that accrues to President Biden’s benefit is another matter. Gallup has for years asked voters whether they had a litmus test regarding abortion rights. Basically, the question is whether you demand a candidate share either your support for abortion rights or your antiabortion views to earn your vote. And its latest survey shows the country continuing to trend toward demanding support for abortion rights. Fully 23 percent of voters support abortion rights and demand candidates who do the same, compared with just 8 percent who say the same about opposing abortion rights. That’s not only a reversal from where things stood for a quarter-century before Roe fell in 2022 — for that entire time, opposing abortion rights was more of a litmus test. It’s also actually a bigger gap now than it was even in 2022 and 2023. In both of those years, the percentage of voters demanding support for abortion rights outpaced those demanding opposition by seven points; the gap has widened to 15 points. We also got some eye-popping data on this front last week. Fox News polling in Arizona and Florida showed remarkable levels of support for adding abortion rights to those states’ constitutions — 70 percent in Arizona and 69 percent in Florida. In both states, even Trump supporters and Republicans leaned in favor of the ballot measures. Those surveys come on top of others showing the measures leading by wide margins, as well. In fact, should these measures even approach such numbers in November, they would be bigger victories for abortion rights than in any other state. Abortion rights have won on states’ ballots every time since the fall of Roe, exceeding the Democratic presidential vote share by an average of about eight points and a maximum of 12 points (in Ohio last year). These new Arizona and Florida numbers would outpace Biden’s 2020 showing by 20 points or more. While much is to be determined, and these numbers could fall over time, it seems possible that these states’ harsh restrictions — Arizona briefly reinstated a near-total ban from 1864, while Florida has a six-week ban — have pushed voters more in favor of protecting abortion rights. That would be particularly ominous for efforts to restrict abortion. At the same time, these data don’t necessarily suggest a political game changer for Biden. Gallup notes, for instance, that those newly demanding support for abortion rights are almost exclusively Democratic-leaning voters. That suggests this could be more of a turnout motivator than something that will change votes. The Arizona and Florida data also echo something remarkable that we’ve seen in other polling. While abortion rights are clear winners even in these competitive states, voters don’t really extend that advantage to the pro-abortion-rights candidate, Biden. The abortion rights ballot measure led by 43 points in Arizona (70-27), but Biden led by just six points when asked which candidate would do a better job on abortion (50-44). And while the measure led by 42 points in Florida (69-27), Biden led on the issue by just five points (50-45). This despite Trump’s having appointed the justices who overturned Roe and taking credit for that decision. One way to look at this is that abortion rights might not save Biden — and perhaps Trump’s arm’s-length approach to the issue is paying dividends. Another is that this issue is ripe for messaging more effectively in the closing months of the campaign. At the very least, there appears to be a growing segment of the population that could be receptive to that contrast."
63,Andrew Golden,An assist from CJ Abrams helped Eddie Rosario break out at the plate,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/10/eddie-rosario-nationals-cj-abrams-bat/,"The Nationals outfielder got his hands on his teammate’s bat, and that helped him overcome a rough start.",2024-06-10T13:00:11Z,"Ask Eddie Rosario to pinpoint when he started to feel like himself again at the plate, and he will mention the Washington Nationals’ three-game series against Toronto in early May. His stats support that: He broke an 0-for-27 skid with a single May 4. The next day, he hit the first of his four home runs in a six-game stretch, leading to National League player of the week honors. There could be a handful of reasons for his breakout that weekend, but Rosario believes an assist from a teammate helped. “CJ [Abrams] gave me his bat,” Rosario said through an interpreter. “And since then, I felt like it changed.” Entering that series, Rosario was hitting .086 with a .290 OPS. Since then, he is hitting .260 with an .819 OPS, lifting his season totals to .190 and .607. He has Abrams, in part, to thank. Abrams designs his custom bats with Overfly Sports, an El Paso company the shortstop has relied on since he was a minor leaguer with the San Diego Padres. One of his models features a light bulb-shaped knob and a cartoon alien. That was the one Rosario used, leading the 32-year-old outfielder to buy a handful just like it. “Whatever feels good, you know?” Abrams said. “Whatever you feel comfortable with at the plate, use it.” Maybe Abrams’s bat was all Rosario needed. Or maybe it was the weather — Rosario said he can’t hit in the cold, so he struggles early every season; he’s a career .205 hitter in March/April, by far his worst average in any month. Whatever the reason, Rosario is now hitting as the Nationals hoped he would when they signed him to a minor league contract in March. He’s a veteran who provides power, which this team has sorely lacked, and could be a trade chip when the deadline arrives in late July. His numbers for the season don’t paint a picture of his recent success, but the left-handed hitter has a track record of power (166 career home runs) to go with postseason experience (30 games). That could be appealing to a contender. “Every time in my career, after about 100 at-bats, everything is more easy to see,” Rosario said. “You get your timing, and you get more comfortable at home plate.” Rosario made a name for himself in 2021, when he was dealt from Cleveland to Atlanta at the trade deadline and then put together an impressive NL Championship Series performance that earned him MVP honors as the Braves roared to the World Series title. But Rosario missed half of the next season with an eye injury. He hit 21 home runs in 2023, but the Braves did not re-sign him. Rosario went 3 for 8 with a double and three RBI against his former team over the weekend as the Nationals won their second series against the Braves in as many weeks. After signing in the middle of spring training, Rosario admitted his timing was off early in the season. With the Braves, his struggles might not have been as apparent, given their stacked lineup. With the Nationals, his lack of production was obvious. “In some instances, the pressure is off because you have a multitude of guys around you,” hitting coach Darnell Coles said. “Here, he’s one of the guys that’s expected to — and does — carry us at times. And that’s a good thing.” Coles said Rosario has handled the responsibility of being a clubhouse leader, guiding younger players such as Abrams and second baseman Luis García Jr. Rosario isn’t one to speak up often, Coles said, but when he does, his teammates listen. Rosario also has been leading by example in the batting cage. His routine features lots of tee work, including setting the tee in the left-handed batter’s box so he can simulate getting to inside pitches as he did last month on a home run against Seattle. Rosario continued to stick with it, even as he struggled. He believes it’s paying dividends — and having Abrams’s bats around if needed doesn’t hurt. “I think now he’s finally got his timing,” Coles said. “With that, you get your confidence. And with confidence, you feel like he can hit anybody. And I think right now he’s doing just that.”"
64,Spencer Nusbaum,Nick Senzel’s 3-for-3 day powers the Nats to another win over the Braves,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/08/nick-senzel-nationals-braves/,The offseason addition had a home run and two doubles in a 7-3 victory.,2024-06-09T00:27:05Z,"In the offseason, Nick Senzel and the Washington Nationals took a chance on each other. Senzel signed in the hope that a change of scenery would do him some good after five years with the Cincinnati Reds. Washington, in turn, believed he could recapture the pop that made him the No. 2 draft pick in 2016. With three swings in Saturday afternoon’s 7-3 win over the Atlanta Braves, that partnership looked pretty good. Senzel finished with three extra-base hits, the last of which — a two-run homer into the visiting bullpen at Nationals Park in the sixth inning, after which he rounded the bases stone-faced — capped a second straight win. “I feel like I’m also my worst critic,” Senzel said. “I always think I can do better. But that’s the game of baseball.” That humble approach has helped him blossom and also allowed him to focus on his plate discipline — a tenet Manager Dave Martinez credited for much of the 28-year-old’s success. Though he had always sported a walk rate around MLB average, it has climbed to 13.8 percent this year, putting him in the top 5 percent of major leaguers, per Baseball Savant. Though a player’s eye for the strike zone can be difficult to change, Martinez said the Nationals just had to show Senzel how effective he is when he’s disciplined. He has a .992 OPS on the pitch that follows a ball, per the website TruMedia, the best mark on the team. “When you don’t have the success of getting hits … walks can keep you afloat in a sense,” Senzel said. “Not like I’m trying to draw walks but just trying to understand, maybe situationally, what the pitchers are trying to do.” His OPS began the day at .726 OPS; it ended the day at a team-high .793. He now is a key cog in Washington’s lineup and has worked his way into being a potential trade chip at the deadline. Senzel’s production has come in bunches — he has six home runs, and his first five came in a five-game span in late April — and he could be entering another hot stretch now. He credits his success to calculated aggression. “You try to shrink the zone into what your strengths are, and I think what I’ve learned over the course of my career is the more aggressive I can be, the less I swing at maybe bad pitches,” Senzel said. “You’ve got to be aggressive in this league.” He walked in his final plate appearance for good measure. The Nationals (29-35) worked better at-bats as a whole against Braves righty Charlie Morton than they had in their previous two games, which put them up 3-0 after two innings. Eddie Rosario’s double pushed two runs across in the first, then CJ Abrams worked a seven-pitch at-bat and lined a single that scored Senzel in the second. Senzel brought Luis García Jr. home with a double in the fourth and drove in two more runs with his sixth-inning homer to make it 7-2 after Lane Thomas had scored after two errors and Rosario’s single in the fifth. “It’s always important for us to get ahead early,” Rosario said through an interpreter. “It adds more confidence to our starting pitcher when we have the lead.” That early offense gave MacKenzie Gore a nice cushion against the Braves (35-27) in what became a strong bounce-back start from the left-hander following a six-run outing earlier in the week. Gore still had to battle in his five-plus innings — in addition to extricating himself from a bases-loaded jam in the first, the 25-year-old threw more pitches out of the strike zone than he had in any start since last August. And, sure, there was a grimace here and there. In the sixth, after he allowed two leadoff hits and exited the game after 99 pitches, he kicked a little dirt on the mound and let out a sigh. But there wasn’t any high-octane frustration — not after Ozzie Albies’s double in the fifth cut Washington’s lead to 4-1 or from the dugout when Derek Law’s wild pitch allowed an inherited runner to score. “Night and day [from last year], right?” Martinez said. “He’s so much better than he was last year. Last year, he’s stomping all over the mound or screaming in his glove. This year, he’s been really good — which is awesome, which is one of the reasons he’s doing what he’s doing. He’s able to get out of high-leverage situations without getting blown up.” Gore finished with seven strikeouts and got a handful of comical whiffs. “I’m an emotional guy — I always have been since I was young,” Gore said. “It’s more being able to execute when guys are on.”"
65,Spencer Nusbaum,"With midgame course correction, Nationals end four-game skid",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/07/nationals-braves-jake-irwin/,"Jake Irvin pitches six scoreless innings, and the Nationals get to Braves ace Chris Sale in a 2-1 victory at Nationals Park.",2024-06-08T01:24:04Z,"The Washington Nationals had a plan Friday night. And for three perfect innings, Atlanta Braves left-hander Chris Sale made them forget it. The Nationals wanted to swing at strikes in the zone. They instead chased 5o percent of Sale’s pitches outside it and watched 40 percent of his pitches inside it go by for called strikes. Their first time through the order featured five strikeouts and plenty of frustrated swings. It appeared, in essence, the Nationals had worked their way into the sort of jam from which they had not often crawled out over the past month. Against Atlanta and one of the best pitchers on the planet, it would take a midgame course correction, lights-out pitching from right-hander Jake Irvin and stellar base running to turn the game around. In a 2-1 win that snapped a four-game losing streak, that was exactly what Washington got. “That’s a tough team,” said Manager Dave Martinez, who noted that his batters started to make better decisions after the third inning. “Coming into the game, we knew how good [Sale] was pitching, and he was all that today. We got a couple runs and were able to hold them off.” That adjustment began in the fourth inning. After CJ Abrams chased two noncompetitive sliders in his first at-bat, he hit a ball down the left field line, then swam around a tag for a double. Nick Senzel, who popped out on four pitches in the first, laid off five pitches and walked to put two on. “He’s got a lot of good stuff, and it’s coming at a weird angle. You just got to be aggressive and compete,” Abrams said of Sale. “Just staying on that fastball, not worrying about the slider. A lot of the times, it’s out of the zone for a chase. … Just got to be aggressive and compete. Just fought and won.” Then Washington executed a double steal — Senzel’s first steal of the season and Abrams’s ninth. Braves catcher Sean Murphy went to second base because of Senzel’s late jump, but the ball skipped into the outfield, allowing Abrams to cross home with his arms extended. Senzel became the 17th National to steal a base this season, helping Washington (28-35) earn its major league-best 97th stolen base. “We want to be aggressive on the base paths; stealing the extra 90 feet scores more runs, and [first base coach Gerardo Parra] does a good job giving us good counts to go on,” Abrams said. “So, you know, everybody’s stealing bags. And I like that.” Two batters later, Ildemaro Vargas poked a ball through a gap in the infield to push Senzel across for a 2-0 lead over Atlanta (35-26), the only support Irvin needed Friday night. The 27-year-old right-hander was an elevated version of his usual self: He kept the ball in the zone and fooled the Braves with a mix of his fastball and curveball, turning in one of the best performances of his young career. After retiring the Braves’ first eight batters, he escaped a bases-loaded jam in the third when Marcell Ozuna grounded out. The Braves threatened again in the sixth, putting men on second and third with no outs after the wind carried what looked like a routine flyball to right field away from Lane Thomas for a double. But Irvin responded, inducing a popup and groundball back to him for the first two outs. Irvin then began his trot back to the dugout and peeked over his shoulder as the next routine flyball landed in Jesse Winker’s glove in left field. On his route, he let out three fist pumps — each about a second apart — and punched his glove before disappearing into the dugout with one final fist pump. It ended his outing at six scoreless innings. He allowed just four hits and two walks, striking out four with limited hard contact. “You lock in just a little bit more,” Irvin said of his performance in the sixth. “That’s one of those situations where you can give in and ruin a quality outing. It’s just about competing, making sure that I do everything I can to keep us ahead of that ballgame, and you just have to be a little more precise.” “High-leverage situations don’t seem to rattle him much,” Martinez said. “For me, it’s all about maturity and confidence. And he’s got both right now.” The trio of Derek Law, Hunter Harvey and Kyle Finnegan closed it out for Washington. Harvey allowed a run in the eighth after a two-out double when Jacob Young lost a ball in the lights in center field, but Ozzie Albies grounded out to end it. Finnegan struck out two batters in the ninth for his 17th save. “We made some big pitches when it mattered,” Finnegan said. “Irv did an unbelievable job setting the tone. He really showed the way for the rest of the guys who followed him.” Note: Josiah Gray will throw 50 to 55 pitches for low Class A Fredericksburg on Saturday in his first rehab assignment since he strained his right flexor muscle in early April. There is still no timetable on his return, but the Nationals plan to bring him to this week’s series in Detroit, then have him start in Class AA Harrisburg if all goes well. In his last live bullpen session, his velocity was up to 93 mph. … Cade Cavalli also will come on the trip to Detroit and throw a bullpen session. The right-hander is in the tail end of his recovery from Tommy John surgery in March 2023 and has not pitched in a rehab assignment since May 30, though Martinez said it wasn’t a matter of concern. “I still feel like we’re still a little bit ahead of schedule,” Martinez said of Cavalli. “Honestly, I didn’t really foresee him pitching [in MLB] until July. So he’s done really well.”"
66,Spencer Nusbaum,A seven-run outburst boosts the Nats to a third straight win over the Braves,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/09/nationals-braves-series-win-keibert-ruiz-cj-abrams/,"As their rotation gained a little clarity, the Nationals erupted in the fourth inning to score an 8-5 victory.",2024-06-09T23:12:19Z,"After three innings Sunday afternoon, just about the last thing it seemed the Washington Nationals would do was rally to win a four-game series against the Atlanta Braves for the second time in two weeks. But that is, in fact, exactly what they did. They pushed across seven runs in the fourth for their most in an inning since May 2023 as they pulled out an 8-5 win at Nationals Park. “This group is fun. They play with a lot of energy — and it showed here this series,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “They don’t quit.” The Nationals hadn’t experienced this exact predicament before — playing on their 17th (and final) day in a row, they struggled through three hitless innings against a pitcher who was making his major league debut, Braves right-hander Hurston Waldrep. But they had gone through similar lows and, with their third straight win and 17th comeback victory of the season, experienced the process of getting that joy back. So how exactly does that happen? “Being more patient,” Martinez said. “I don’t mind being aggressive, but you’ve got to get the ball in the zone.” And what did that look like? It looked like CJ Abrams connecting on a deep flyout to begin the fourth, then nodding. It looked like Lane Thomas lining the Nationals’ first hit to prompt scattered cheers, Jesse Winker drawing a walk to get the dugout stirring and Eddie Rosario flying out deep to instill some confidence in his teammates, even with two outs. It looked like Luis García Jr. working a hitter’s count, poking an opposite field single for their first run and flashing a big grin to his teammates. It looked like Keibert Ruiz turning on the first pitch he saw for a three-run homer into the Nationals’ bullpen, pointing toward the dugout as he approached first base and then at the bullpen as he rounded it. (It also looked like reliever Jacob Barnes catching the ball in the bullpen and flipping it to bullpen coach Ricky Bones.) It looked like Nick Senzel walking, Joey Gallo singling and Jacob Young walking. And then it looked like Abrams enjoying a few extra swings as Waldrep was removed from the game before he roped the dagger, a bases-clearing double off Aaron Bummer that gave the Nationals (30-35) a 7-2 lead and prompted Abrams to shake his hips toward the dugout. “We learned it, wanted to see more pitches [against Waldrep],” Abrams said. “Did a good job getting on base, getting it to the next guy and getting him out of there.” Ruiz pushed one more run across on a sacrifice fly in the fifth, and the bullpen held off the Braves (35-28) despite Jordan Weems conceding three runs in the ninth. “It was hype,” said left-hander DJ Herz, who in his second major league start allowed two runs, struck out five and walked three in 4⅓ innings. “I was going crazy. I was clapping my hands. I was screaming. I was like, ‘Let’s go do this!’ ” The fourth-inning outburst may have overshadowed an important day for the rotation. Down Interstate 95, righty Josiah Gray (strained flexor muscle) made his first rehab start for low Class A Fredericksburg, allowing three earned runs in three innings that served as progress despite tepid results. On the mound at Nationals Park, Herz battled out of command issues that helped the Braves grab a 2-0 lead in the second inning. And before the game, the Nationals announced they would skip Patrick Corbin’s next turn in the rotation, a move that Martinez said was meant to give the lefty a breather. That gives Washington more time to embrace its young core of MacKenzie Gore, Jake Irvin, Mitchell Parker and Herz, a group that is in line to add Gray and righty Cade Cavalli, who is in the final stages of rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, over the next month or so. Corbin has the highest ERA and lowest strikeout rate of any qualified major league starter. In these four games against Atlanta, Gore, Irvin, Parker and Herz allowed six earned runs in 22⅓ innings, good for a 2.42 ERA. “It’s so cool to see these guys go out five, six innings every time and everybody’s shoving,” Herz said. “We can go on a roll right now.” Herz, a 23-year-old who faced challenges with his command at Class AAA Rochester, worked his way through similar issues Sunday. Though he needed just 12 pitches to get through a one-two-three first, his command strayed in the second. After allowing an RBI single to Michael Harris II, the problems got worse. He walked Orlando Arcia to load the bases. He got two strikes on Jarred Kelenic before throwing two pitches high and in — which Kelenic took exception to — and bouncing the next one in the dirt for a wild pitch and a 2-0 deficit. He didn’t allow another run. He calmed himself by using an approach he learned from the coaching staff — counting down from five in “slow motion.” “I love where they’re at right now,” Martinez said of his starting pitchers. “I love how they’re attacking hitters. It’s fun to watch.”"
67,Andrew Golden,Nationals rise above a sloppy game to claim a fourth straight victory,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/11/nationals-tigers-winning-streak/,"By beating the Tigers, 5-4, in 10 innings, the Nationals matched their longest winning streak of the season.",2024-06-12T02:14:34Z,"DETROIT — It was only fitting that a game defined by miscues was decided in extra innings with another.  In the 10th inning Tuesday night at Comerica Park, Detroit Tigers reliever Andrew Chafin struck out Washington Nationals leadoff hitter CJ Abrams. That would have been the ideal start to a high-stress appearance had Chafin not thrown a wild pitch that allowed Abrams to reach first base and Jacob Young, the Nationals’ automatic runner, to advance to third. With Young 90 feet closer, Lane Thomas’s sacrifice fly gave the Nationals a 5-4 lead that stood up when the Tigers couldn’t push across a run in the bottom half. Washington (31-35) has won four in a row to match a season high. Detroit (32-34) has lost four of five. Before that, it seemed this game would serve as the perfect example of why every major league team partakes in mundane pitchers’ fielding practice — better known as PFP — under the hot sun of spring training. One misplayed grounder in a game that matters, the players are told, could upend an outing for a pitcher and an outcome for his team.  Mitchell Parker got a reminder of that Tuesday night. With two outs and a runner on first base in the fifth inning, the Tigers’ Andy Ibáñez hit a grounder back to Parker, who had a 3-0 lead. All Parker had to do was field the ball and throw to Joey Gallo at first base.  Instead, Parker bobbled the ball and couldn’t recover, putting two runners on. After a walk loaded the bases, Riley Greene hit a triple into the gap in right-center that cleared the bases. As Greene slid into third base, an errant relay throw from second baseman Luis García Jr. evaded Nick Senzel, allowing Greene to score as well. On a Little League grand slam, the Tigers suddenly had a 4-3 lead. Greene was the last batter Parker faced; the rookie exited with his head down after allowing four runs for the first time in his career. All of those runs were unearned, of course, so his ERA dropped to 3.21. He allowed four hits, walked three and struck out one. Parker wasn’t nearly as sharp as he had been in previous outings. The 24-year-old left-hander has allowed seven walks in three June starts after yielding eight in the first eight starts of his career. He also generated just two whiffs on 29 Detroit swings. The Nationals scored first, pushing one run across in the third inning when Kenta Maeda walked Jesse Winker with the bases loaded. Maeda was erratic over four innings — he threw just 40 of 77 pitches for strikes — but Washington managed just that one run. Gallo, who exited in the seventh inning after grabbing at the back of his left leg, opened the fifth inning with a single off reliever Beau Brieske. Abrams’s one-out triple brought him home. Abrams then scored on a heads-up play when Thomas hit a popup into foul territory that first baseman Mark Canha caught with his back turned. Abrams sprinted home, and Parker had a cushion that didn’t last long. The Nationals tied it thanks to two Tigers errors in the eighth. With one out, Thomas singled, and the ball bounced off Greene’s glove in left field, allowing him to advance to second base. Winker reached on a fielding error by shortstop Ryan Kreidler to put runners on the corners before Ildemaro Vargas’s sacrifice fly tied the score. Two innings later, thanks to four outs from closer Kyle Finnegan, the Nationals had another win. Right-hander Josiah Gray threw a bullpen session Tuesday and will make his next rehab start Friday for Class AA Harrisburg.  Gray (strained right flexor muscle) threw 43 pitches and allowed three runs over three innings in his first rehab start Sunday at low Class A Fredericksburg. He said he was a little rusty as he adjusted to his game routine again but noted that he left the start without feeling too sore. The 26-year-old primarily threw his fastball and cutter but will look to incorporate his breaking pitches in rehab starts to come. “Just working out the kinks,” he said. “Looking forward to the next one and progressing from there.” Righty Cade Cavalli, who is working his way back from Tommy John surgery in March 2023, will throw a bullpen session Wednesday. If all goes well, he could face hitters Saturday.  Cavalli made his most recent start for high Class A Wilmington on May 30, but the Nationals wanted to give the 25-year-old a breather as he nears the end of his rehab. “Just a little moment to pause and regather and go back into the rehab starts in attack mode,” he said. “I’m very thankful for it, and I’m ready to get going.”"
68,Andrew Golden,‘Let’s keep rocking’: CJ Abrams leads Nats to fifth straight win,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/12/nationals-tigers-cj-abrams/,"In the victorious postgame clubhouse, there was a lot of talk about vibes. And the Nats’ vibes are immaculate.",2024-06-13T02:31:01Z,"DETROIT — CJ Abrams was bound to return to form at the plate. In April, Abrams was one of the top shortstops in baseball. In May, he was anything but. But the version of Abrams that showed up at Comerica Park on Wednesday night was closer to the one that started the season — the type of player who could pull a no-doubter into the seats in right field in one at-bat, lace a double into left-center gap in the next and race around the bases to score a few batters later. When Abrams is in a rhythm at the plate, like he was in the Nationals’ 7-5 win over the Detroit Tigers, his presence can be felt. Batting atop the lineup, he finished 2 for 5 with that 404-foot homer in the third and an RBI double in the fifth as the Nationals won their fifth straight, their longest winning streak since 2021. “We’re going out there and competing every day, carrying a good vibe,” Abrams said. “Things are going well for us. We’re getting guys on, getting them in and our pitchers are doing their thing. So let’s keep rocking.” Abrams is hitting just .242 in June (8 for 33), but six of those eight hits have been for extra bases. “He’s starting to get a little bit more patient, which we’ve been harping on for a while now,” Manager Dave Martinez said. “He’s getting better. He’s got to get the ball in the strike zone, just like everybody else. When we do that and we’re patient and we get guys on base, there’s a reason why we’re scoring some runs.” Abrams began the month dealing with a shoulder injury that sidelined him from May 31 to June 4. Before that, he endured a dismal May (. 205 with just one walk). Pitchers attacked Abrams with breaking balls out of the zone and, too often, he’d chase. At times, he looked lost. A new month, however, has brought a reset. After Matt Vierling hit a leadoff home run off Jake Irvin in the bottom of the first to give the Tigers an early 1-0 lead, Abrams answered in the third, blasting a curveball from Reese Olson about five rows into the bleachers in right field. The ball exited at 104.3 mph. In his previous at-bat, he grounded out on a curveball. “Yeah, I missed it the first time,” Abrams said. “But I got the second one. Adjustments, it’s a game of adjustments.” Keibert Ruiz hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning to give the Nationals a 2-1 lead before Abrams sparked a three-run rally in the fifth with a ground-rule double that drove in Jacob Young. Abrams worked a five-pitch at-bat and connected on a fastball in the zone. Two batters later, Jesse Winker drove Abrams in with the first of three straight singles by the Nationals. Luis García Jr, who had the third single, stole second and when the ball skipped away from the shortstop, Winker scored. Garcia’s stolen base was the Nationals’ 100th of the season in their 67th game, making the Nationals the quickest team to steal that many bases since 2009. Even Abrams’s outs were loud — in the seventh, Abrams hit a grounder at 103.7 mph with an expected batting average of .560 but first baseman Mark Canha make a diving stop to rob Abrams. Irvin settled in after a rocky first. He allowed three hits to the first four batters he faced and put runners on the corners, but stranded them. After that, Irvin faced 21 more hitters, allowed three singles and a walk. By the time he exited in the sixth, his ERA dropped to 3.00. The Nationals’ four-run lead shrunk to one in the eighth when Detroit rattled off four straight hits — one against Robert Garcia and three against Dylan Floro, including an RBI single by Colt Keith and a two-run double by Gio Urshela. But Hunter Harvey entered and retired the next three batters in order. Washington tacked on a pair of runs in the ninth as insurance, Kyle Finnegan earned the save. “We’re being really consistent,” Irvin said. “The vibes are just high. We trust each other. We’re getting to know each other and our games a lot better. And it’s really cool when all facets of the game are clicking.” The Nationals placed Joey Gallo on the 10-day injured list with a strained hamstring after he came up limping in the seventh inning of Tuesday night’s win. Utility man Trey Lipscomb was recalled to fill his place, his third stint with the parent club. Martinez said Lipscomb will play a variety of positions including first base. Gallo hadn’t gotten an MRI as of Wednesday afternoon, so he didn’t know the severity of the injury. But the hope is that Gallo can come back and contribute sooner rather than later — the 30-year-old first baseman was hitting .262 with a .762 OPS in his past 15 games. … Patrick Corbin will start Thursday’s series finale against the Tigers instead of MacKenzie Gore, who was originally scheduled to pitch but will now start Friday. Gore is dealing with what Martinez described as an issue with a fingernail on Gore’s throwing hand. The problem developed after Gore’s last start, but Gore was able to pitch through it."
69,Andrew Golden,Nationals’ bullpen wobbles and their five-game winning streak ends,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/13/nationals-tigers-bullpen-corbin/,"After winning the first two games of the series, the Nationals’ offense goes listless in the finale.",2024-06-13T22:15:31Z,"DETROIT — Derek Law paced around the mound at Comerica Park, head down and glove dangling, as Washington Nationals Manager Dave Martinez left the dugout to remove the right-hander from the game in the seventh inning. Law had entered an inning earlier and, in what had been a 1-1 game, allowed a solo home run. Washington answered with a run in the top of the seventh, but the bottom half was a struggle. By the time Martinez came out with the hook, the visitors were down two and the threat was far from extinguished. And by the time the inning finally ended, the Detroit Tigers had plated five runs, leading to a 7-2 loss that snapped the Nationals’ five-game winning streak. Detroit’s hits against Law weren’t necessarily loud, but runs aren’t scored by exit velocity. Law gave up a 69.5-mph single to Ryan Kreidler, then a 71.5-mph bloop single to Matt Vierling before an RBI double by Andy Ibáñez opened the floodgates. Mark Canha hit a sacrifice fly to extend the lead and end Law’s outing. “Throughout the year, games like that are going to happen,” Law said. “You just never know when it’s going to be, and you hope it’s not a game like that.” In the top half, Ildemaro Vargas hit his second sacrifice fly of the game to knot the score at 2. Washington produced only five hits on the afternoon and just two for extra bases — a pair of doubles from Joey Meneses. The team also finished without the services of outfielder Lane Thomas, who was ejected in the sixth inning for disagreeing with a called third strike from home plate umpire Emil Jimenez. Thomas didn’t look at Jimenez, who tossed him anyway. “Looking back, what I said was nothing that I haven’t said in the past, and I thought it was a little quick,” Thomas said. “I definitely didn’t say anything toward him. So that was the frustrating part for me.” And yet the Nationals (32-36) still had a chance to claw out a late-inning win on the road. Law has proved to be a reliable option for Martinez and entered with a 1.89 ERA in his past 16 appearances entering Thursday. But Law said he didn’t feel like himself for most of the afternoon. His slider, his go-to pitch recently, wasn’t working the way he liked. That was the pitch that Justyn-Henry Malloy blasted for a home run in the sixth and Ibáñez hit up the middle in the seventh. “It’s kind of been my pitch the last couple good ones that I’ve had,” Law said. “It’s been really good. Kind of really didn’t have it today.” To complete the sweep in Detroit, Washington had to win without its best bullpen arms after the team nearly blew a four-run lead Wednesday night. Martinez was forced to use Hunter Harvey and Kyle Finnegan to preserve the series win, and both needed a day off Thursday. Dylan Floro pitched in each of the series’ first two games as well. The Nationals have relied heavily on their bullpen — entering Thursday, Floro was tied for third in the majors with 34 appearances, and Harvey and Law were both tied for eighth with 32. So Martinez’s options were limited. In an ideal world, Washington would have grabbed a big lead for Patrick Corbin and the bullpen decisions would have mattered less. Instead, Corbin exited with one out in the sixth inning of a 1-1 game. Corbin limited the Tigers (33-35) to four hits. And like Law, he didn’t surrender much hard contact. Detroit scored a run in the third thanks to three singles — a 37.0-mph bunt, a 94.4-mph grounder and a 69.4-mph bloop hit into left from Canha. Corbin had traffic on the bases, but he kept the game within striking distance. After Law exited, left-handed reliever Robert Garcia entered to face lefty Riley Greene with two outs and allowed an RBI single. He walked the next hitter, then allowed a two-run double to Malloy. If there was one bright spot Thursday afternoon, it was former closer Tanner Rainey, who lowered his ERA to 7.94 with a fourth straight scoreless inning. “We’ve relied on these guys throughout the whole year, and they’ve done really well,” Martinez said. “It just didn’t happen today. Corbin gave us everything he had there. He had a lot of pitches, and we had to get to that bullpen. These guys have been really good all year. It’s just one game.” Note: The Nationals claimed right-handed reliever Eduardo Salazar off waivers from the Seattle Mariners and optioned him to Class AAA Rochester. The team’s 40-man roster is now at 39 players. Salazar, 26, has a 6.91 ERA in nine big league appearances. He debuted with the Cincinnati Reds last year but became a free agent after the season. He joined the Dodgers, who designated him for assignment in May, then the Mariners, who claimed him and then DFA’d him Sunday."
70,Spencer Nusbaum,The Nats stay hot — and tempers get hot — in a rout of the Marlins,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/14/nationals-marlins-mackenzie-gore-nick-senzel/,MacKenzie Gore yields only one run — a run that leads to heated moment in the dugout — before the positive vibes return in an 8-1 win over Miami.,2024-06-15T02:21:22Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. The final tally Friday night, an 8-1 win over the Miami Marlins that included a seven-run third inning and a 10-strikeout performance from MacKenzie Gore, should indicate that the Washington Nationals handled their series opener against the National League’s worst team with aplomb. But Gore was frustrated after the second inning ended. And that colored the rest of the game. The left-hander had pitched himself into trouble in the second frame, allowing a single to Tim Anderson before hitting Dane Myers with a pitch, then uncorking a wild pitch that allowed each to advance. With two outs, Nick Fortes reached on an infield single when Nick Senzel’s throw from behind the third base bag was late, allowing the game’s first run to score. “Probably got to do a better job of getting rid of it with a better throw,” Senzel said. “Maybe a little lackadaisical. So that was on me.” A frustrated Gore cursed to himself, then blew three straight angry fastballs over 97 mph past Jazz Chisholm Jr. to end the inning. Emotions then spilled into the dugout. Senzel and Gore traded words before Senzel pushed Gore and the two had to be separated. Gore was escorted by Jesse Winker back into the tunnel. After the game, neither Senzel, Gore nor Manager Dave Martinez tied the incident to any specific play. In the clubhouse, emotions seemed to cool; Gore and Senzel were friendly as they walked by each other. The trio all said they were keeping details of the incident in-house and had put it in the past. When asked explicitly whether they had moved past it, Gore laughed and said yes. “We’ve handled it in here,” Gore said. “The biggest thing is that — that was something that I can’t do, but I’m going to leave it at that.” “We worked it out internally, and what stays in here stays in here, and that’s really all there is to it,” Senzel said. “We’re competitors.” “I don’t know if you have any brothers — I fought my brothers every day,” Martinez said. “It’s part of it. When you’re around each other a little bit, I love it, it’s the competitive nature of them. What they did after that was awesome. The rest of it will stay in our circle. ... I’ve been on some really good teams where guys get after it, and everything was okay.” The tension seemed to dissipate in the inning that followed, perhaps helped by the fact that Jacob Young, CJ Abrams, Lane Thomas, Winker, Eddie Rosario, Joey Meneses and Luis García Jr. all stepped to the plate in the third before an out was made. Young and Abrams singled before Thomas crushed a first-pitch fastball 379 feet and was greeted by Ildemaro Vargas with a cartoonish red, white and blue top hat (think Uncle Sam). Winker legged out an infield single and Rosario doubled before Meneses laced a single that scored them both. And García’s single was followed by the first out before the Nationals loaded the bases and struck again for two more runs on Abrams’s second single of the frame. “They’re just two competitive dudes, and I think on good teams, that stuff happens,” Thomas said before joking about the moment. “It kind of fired me up. I don’t know. I thought we had a good inning after that. So maybe we need a little more.” And while Martinez often implores his team to be aggressive, it had never worked quite this well: The Nationals’ seven batters saw just 15 pitches in the third before García’s single knocked Marlins right-hander Shaun Anderson from the game. Huascar Brazoban relieved the righty, who was making his first start since 2019. “All of a sudden we clear the air, and here we go,” Martinez said. During the onslaught, Gore and Senzel were seen hugging in the dugout and the positive vibes appeared to return. The Nationals (33-36) have won six of seven and are 5-0 against the Marlins (23-46). Winker poked one more run across in the sixth with a single. Gore was otherwise electric against the Marlins, matching a season high with seven innings, allowing just five hits and that lone run. In the sixth, he even had a moment when he fielded a soft grounder and misfired a throw to García that deflected off the second baseman’s glove and into the outfield. Gore tapped his chest a few times to signal that it was his fault, saw that García wasn’t looking, waited a few more seconds for him to turn around and tapped his chest again. An inning later, he finished on a high note when Martinez sent him back out to the mound at 90 pitches and with no one warming up. With two outs, he threw three straight pitches out of the zone to Chisholm. On his fourth pitch, Chisholm began walking to first before it reached the plate. It was called a strike, and three pitches later, he was the victim of Gore’s final strikeout as the lefty got his career-best 25th swing and miss of the game. Gore then exited to a standing ovation. Notes: After the game, Martinez said first baseman Joey Gallo suffered a significant hamstring strain and will be out for a while. He did not offer a more specific time table. ... Right-hander Josiah Gray (strained right flexor muscle near his forearm) made his second rehab start and first with Class AA Harrisburg, tossing four innings and allowing four hits and one run with no walks and two strikeouts. The plan was for Gray to mix in his entire seven-pitch arsenal. ... As the Nationals hoped earlier in the week, right-hander Cade Cavalli will throw a live bullpen session Saturday as he works his way back from Tommy John surgery 15 months ago. Martinez said the team will evaluate his status afterward, but that Cavalli’s next rehab start should be “pretty soon.” He threw 95 to 98 mph with ease in a recent bullpen session and felt good, Martinez said. He has not made a rehab start since May 30. ... On Monday, lefty reliever Jose A. Ferrer will throw his first live bullpen session, expected to be limited to 15 to 20 fastballs, since being placed on the 60-day injured list with a right shoulder strain in March."
71,Andrew Golden,Rookie DJ Herz delivers historic dominance as the Nats blank Marlins,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/15/nationals-rookie-dj-herz-marlins/,"In just his third start in the majors, 22-year-old rookie DJ Herz is all but untouchable while striking out 13 Marlins in a 4-0 win.",2024-06-15T23:45:00Z,"By the sixth inning, DJ Herz had mastered his strikeout strut. He had done it 10 times entering the frame, and with each ensuing punchout, his stalk around the mound became just a bit more pronounced. So when he struck out Vidal Bruján with a change-up for the first out of the inning, he hopped before he glided toward the third base side. And when he buckled Christian Bethancourt’s knees in the ensuing at-bat, Herz stepped quickly toward third base as his arms swayed by his side. His last hitter in the Nationals’ 4-0 win over the Miami Marlins on Saturday afternoon at Nationals Park was Tim Anderson, who had fanned twice. Herz got up 0-2, and Anderson asked for time in a bid to disrupt Herz’s timing. Nothing else worked to that point, so maybe a few extra seconds could rattle the 23-year-old rookie. No chance. Two pitches later, Herz threw a 93-mph fastball by Anderson for his 13th and final strikeout. And when Anderson swung through the pitch, Herz showed off more than a strut. This time, he turned his back to the home dugout, backpedaled and put his hands out before shaking his glove. “This outing, I wanted to control my body language a little bit more, be a little better at that,” Herz said. “The first five innings, it was perfect. And then I got the last strikeout, and I kind of had a feeling that I was done. And I just let my emotions fly a little bit.” Before his start, Herz said he had a conversation with Jake Irvin about wanting to be emotionless on the mound. “I just wanted to go out there and be a stone-cold killer.” Mission accomplished. The only blemish in his six innings was a Jake Burger single that got past Trey Lipscomb to start the fifth inning. The Nationals (34-36) have won seven of eight and will go for a series sweep Sunday. Manager Dave Martinez pulled Herz after the sixth. The numbers: one hit, 13 strikeouts, 84 pitches, 57 for strikes. And perhaps most important to Herz: no walks. “He and [catcher Drew] Millas worked really good and very quick,” Martinez said. “And they did get into that rhythm, and he was feeling it.” In a Nationals season that will be defined by the growth of the team’s young starters, Herz could be the surprise of the bunch. The team knew Josiah Gray, MacKenzie Gore and Jake Irvin would be big league contributors this season, and Mitchell Parker has been a welcome addition. But Herz, a 6-foot-2 left-hander acquired from the Cubs at the trade deadline last season in the Jeimer Candelario deal, delivered one of the best starts in the majors this season. Per OptaStats, his 68.4 strikeout percentage (13 of the 19 hitters faced) was the second highest by an MLB rookie in the modern era with a minimum of 15 batters faced, trailing only the Cubs’ Kerry Wood in his 20-strikeout game from 1998. His strikeout total was the most by a Nationals pitcher since Max Scherzer fanned 14 in May 2021. “Everything was working tonight, so we couldn’t really go wrong,” Millas said. One more fact from the start that has local appeal: Herz became one of two MLB pitchers with a start of at least 13 strikeouts and no walks in one of his first three outings since 1901 — the other being Stephen Strasburg in his debut June 8, 2010. Pretty good company, especially for a guy who didn’t make it out of the fifth inning in each of his first two starts. He was on a pitch limit in his major league debut. And in the second, it took him 87 pitches to get through 4⅓ innings. Herz couldn’t consistently throw his best pitch, his change-up, in the zone in his first two outings. But he told pitching strategist Sean Doolittle that he felt different entering this start. This time around, Herz was efficient in the first four innings as he racked up the strikeouts. He struck out four and threw just 24 pitches in the first two innings. In the third, Herz struck out the side and followed that up with one more in the fourth. He retired the first 12 Marlins before Burger’s single. “The game didn’t speed up. That’s probably the most calm and relaxed I was,” Herz said. “It’s all about, for me at least, getting comfortable. That might take a little time, but it’s starting to come now.” The Nationals’ offense jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first when Lane Thomas doubled, Jesse Winker — who exited in the third inning and will get an MRI exam on his right knee — singled and Joey Meneses hit a sacrifice fly. Thomas hit his second home run in as many days in the third inning to extend the Nationals’ lead. Meneses added a two-run blast in the eighth. Herz, meanwhile, induced 21 whiffs in 45 swings, including 13 on four-seam fastballs. The Marlins swung through fastballs right down the middle. They watched change-ups paint the corners for called strikes and shook their heads. They chased in the dirt. And as each Marlins hitter slumped back to the dugout, Herz continued to strut. “I mean, it still doesn’t feel real,” Herz said. “I’m super blessed. That was my probably my best game I’ve ever pitched. And to do it at this level, it’s a great feeling.” Notes: The Nationals announced they agreed to terms on a minor league contract with outfielder Harold Ramirez, who will report to Class AAA Rochester. Ramirez, 29, is a six-year major league veteran who was designated for assignment by the Tampa Bay Rays last week. He also had stints with the Miami Marlins and Cleveland Guardians. Ramirez hit .313 with 12 home runs and a .813 OPS a season ago but hasn’t produced the same pop this season; he’s hitting .268 with a .589 OPS and only four of his hits have been for extra bases. . . . Cade Cavalli threw two innings and around 45 pitches in a live bullpen session Saturday afternoon, facing Trey Lipscomb and Nasim Nuñez. Cavalli said his arm felt good as he works his way back from Tommy John surgery."
72,Barry Svrluga,Stephen Strasburg leaves D.C. with a mix of gratitude and regret,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/08/stephen-strasburg-injuries-retirement-washington-nationals/,"As Strasburg enters retirement, he knows there’s a difference between what he accomplished and what might have been.",2024-06-08T10:06:21Z,"As Strasburg enters retirement, he knows there’s a difference between what he accomplished and what might have been. The movers had been at Stephen Strasburg’s house for a couple of days this week when the guys came to help crate up the family’s art. A newly retired baseball player can’t move from McLean back to San Diego without hauling some framed jerseys. On Tuesday afternoon, one of the movers looked at one of those jerseys and suddenly realized whom he was helping. “He kind of got emotional,” Strasburg said Tuesday night. “It hits you. All these people who stop you, who just say, ‘Thank you,’ it makes you realize that, yeah, maybe it didn’t meet your personal expectations. But people saw it. They saw the work that went into it, and they saw: You had an impact.” It has not been an easy or straight road for Strasburg to get his mind to that space. Maybe he’s even convincing himself now. Careers that end on terms other than your own can be hard to process, even tormenting. He knows the realities: After being named the World Series MVP and helping the Washington Nationals — the only team he had ever known — finally, memorably, bring home a championship, he signed a seven-year, $245 million contract under which he was barely able to pitch. Over calamari and salmon at a white-tableclothed Tysons Corner seafood restaurant, Strasburg sighed. “When you’re dealing with a lot of emotions and inner turmoil, to where it’s like — I wouldn’t say I was really beating myself up, but I didn’t feel good about it,” he said. “I felt like I — you know, I failed. I didn’t accomplish what was asked of me.” Also true: From his milestone debut on June 8, 2010 — 14 years ago Saturday — through his dominant 8⅓-inning performance in Game 6 of the 2019 World Series, Strasburg appeared in 248 games for the Nats. His team won 158 of those games, including seven of nine in the postseason. Extrapolate that winning percentage over a 162-game season, and it’s a 103-win pace. But as he reluctantly walks into the athletic sunset, there’s an undeniable difference between what he accomplished and what he might have accomplished. His right arm — indeed, the right side of his body — gave out. “You can say contract, whatever,” he said. “But it was more like: This was the expectation, and this is what I had in my mind. I worked my butt off, and it’s like, I got to the point where I couldn’t do any more, and it just wasn’t attainable. That really wears on your psyche. “So you have a tendency to just sit there in the middle of it and dwell on all of the shortcomings and not necessarily all of the successes. But then when you have people out there and they come up to you [and say]: ‘I just want to say thank you. Like, thank you.’ And in my head for a while, I’m like: ‘Man, yeah. No problem.’ But I’m also kind of battling with this, like, ‘Thanks for what?’ ” The last time Strasburg spoke publicly about his physical condition — after surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) had shut him down yet again — was September 2022. His most recent appearance on a diamond was June 9 of that year. Since he signed the new contract following the 2019 season, he had managed 31⅓ innings across eight starts. He had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. He had a rib and two neck muscles removed. The months that built toward the 2023 season were full of baby steps, each with a faint hope that Strasburg might be able to pitch again. He tried everything. He had dry needles stuck in his right arm in an attempt to increase his range of motion. He would lie on the floor of his home gym with a weight on his arm, trying in vain to get it to straighten out. The doctor who performed his surgery to relieve TOS diagnosed him with what he referred to as “stretch neuropraxia,” meaning the nerves that ran from his neck down through his right shoulder and into his arm were frayed and damaged. Still, that offseason, he reported to Nationals Park daily to play catch with one of the club’s trainers. They started in the batting cages down the steps from the home clubhouse to the dugout. Eventually, they progressed outside, to the field. “I thought it felt pretty good,” Strasburg said. “I just kept trying to progress to where it would be like: ‘Hey, who knows? Maybe I can go to spring training and actually be ready.’ ” Near the end of December 2022, as best he can remember, he asked the club whether he might throw off a mound. Sure, they said. Go ahead. But doctors recommended one more electromyography (EMG) test. The results were sent to a member of the staff of Neal ElAttrache, the renowned Los Angeles orthopedist and shoulder specialist. “He read it, and he basically said, ‘I don’t think you should try to progress to throwing,’ ” Strasburg said. “I just said, ‘Well, if I’m going to be able to do this still, I’m going to try.’ ” He started with a light bullpen session — all fastballs — his first time throwing off a mound since that June start in Miami. A few days later, he tried another easy session, this time mixing in his change-up. By the beginning of February 2023, he tried to mix in his curveball and to ramp up the velocity a bit, all of 30 or 35 pitches. The result: “Everything started like, yard sale, yard sale,” he said. The pitches sprayed everywhere. He had no feel. Physical issues followed almost immediately. His shoulder muscles started to atrophy. He couldn’t lift his right arm. The plan: Take a day of rest, then on the next day, play catch from 45 feet — three-quarters of the distance between the rubber and the plate. “I couldn’t even really get it to him,” Strasburg said. “At that point, I knew something was wrong.” By this point, the symptoms were acute. He drove with his left arm atop the wheel. He had trouble using his right hand to turn a doorknob. Strasburg saw Robin West, the Nationals’ team physician and a noted orthopedist. He said her instructions amounted to: “Just don’t do anything.” They took another EMG to send to ElAttrache and his team. The image revealed more damage to the nerves. “They basically told me that it’s not in your best interest to keep trying this,” Strasburg said. “What kept happening was I was trying to get back, and then you just get further and further away.” On a Sunday afternoon that spring, Strasburg was sitting on his couch at home in McLean. He had just returned from a visit to Dallas to see Gregory Pearl, the orthopedist who had performed his TOS surgery. In the previous weeks, with the season underway, the Nationals had requested Strasburg show up to the ballpark. He was reluctant, he said. He didn’t want to be a player who couldn’t play to be a distraction to those who could. They reached a compromise: Strasburg reported daily to a physical therapy facility to treat an old ankle injury. He didn’t really see the point, he said, but “if they want me to show up, I’ll show up.” After a week or two, he was bracing his leg against a therapist’s arm, resistance exercises. One morning, he awoke with his neck locked up. He saw West, who advised him to see Pearl. And when he returned from that visit to Dallas, he heard a knock on his door. When he opened it, he found a team staffer, who he said issued him a letter signed by Mike Rizzo, the Nationals’ longtime general manager and president of baseball operations — the man who drafted Strasburg all those years ago. “It was an official document,” Strasburg said. “They basically said I was noncompliant with the rehab.” The Nationals declined to answer specific questions about points in time over the course of this process. Instead, the club issued a statement that read in part: “Stephen Strasburg will always be a beloved member of the Washington Nationals family. His health and well-being have always been at the forefront of our organization’s decision-making. The communications between Stephen and the club over the last year-and-a-half have been with the guidance of and in accordance with Major League Baseball and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.” In late July 2023, when the Nationals held a news conference to announce the signing of first-round pick Dylan Crews, Mark Lerner, the team’s principal owner, had occasion to chat with Rizzo and Scott Boras, the superagent who represents both Crews and Strasburg. The conversation wound around to something like: “Hey, Scott. How’s Stras?” The answer: Not good. He won’t pitch again. And Lerner had a suggestion: Let’s do right by him and hold a retirement ceremony. Around the same time, Strasburg discovered an additional incentive to retire. He came across information about an anti-aging clinic in Beverly Hills that offered treatment — including using human growth hormone — to help regenerate nerves. The problem: As an active player, even one who could no longer play, he couldn’t take HGH, which is on baseball’s banned substance list. “So I asked the team, ‘Hey, is it okay if I just go out there and do a consultation?’ ” he said. The team said that was no problem. But even as preliminary plans were circulated internally for a Sept. 9 feting, there were hurdles to clear. Strasburg couldn’t say he was voluntarily retiring, because then he would forfeit the remainder of his salary. The players association is loath to set that sort of precedent. The club knew all along that Strasburg would get the money owed to him. But the sides could not work out a deal in time for a ceremony on the planned date. Momentum fizzled. As spring training of this year approached, the club wanted something from him, and it said so in a letter from Rizzo — attendance at spring training and all team meetings, travel with the team on all regular season road trips, attendance at all home games, availability to teammates and some appearances at fan events, including a celebration of the 2019 title. Strasburg considered some of those interactions staged, inorganic — almost fake. And as a player who could no longer play, he said he wanted to stay out of the way of those who could. “I didn’t sign up to just sit there, right?” he said. “I signed up to play. I think I have too much respect for those guys in the dugout, in the clubhouse, and how hard it is because I went through it. I’m not just going to sit here and just kick my feet up and just put on a uniform [while] all these other guys are out there grinding like that. That’s not beneficial to anybody.” In the end, lawyers from Major League Baseball and the union helped the sides work out a deal in which some of Strasburg’s remaining salary was further deferred, the Lerner family’s preferred payment structure. On April 6, just over a week into the season, the Nationals’ official transactions showed that Strasburg had retired. The next day, speaking about the player he had made the first pick of the 2009 draft, Rizzo said of Strasburg: “He’s one of the Mount Rushmore Nationals, one of the greatest players that we’ve ever had. He was a guy who put us on the map.” An agreement was in place, but all is still not well. Though Strasburg freely talked about the timeline of events over the past few years, he kept some of his feelings guarded. “I don’t want my emotions involved,” he said. But on April 20, when the Nats gathered to celebrate their 2019 championship, the World Series MVP stayed home. Strasburg distinctly remembers the evening of June 8, 2010, and his first major league pregame warmup at Nationals Park. His routine back then, left over from college at San Diego State, was to stretch out his calves by running out to center field, hitting the wall, then doing an about-face. “That feeling and that image is just so detailed — still,” he said, “of just turning around from the fence and just being like: ‘Holy crap. There’s a lot of people here.’ ” Over 14 years, three all-star appearances, four division titles, nine playoff appearances — of which the Nats lost the first two and won the last seven, while he posted a postseason ERA of 1.46 with 71 strikeouts and eight walks in 55⅓ innings — there are memories. At them, he smiled. Broadly. The eerie mist of Game 4 of the 2017 National League Division Series at Wrigley Field, in which Strasburg struck out 12 and allowed three hits over seven scoreless innings, putting behind illness to extend the Nats’ season. Watching from the bullpen — a rare vantage point — in the 2019 wild-card game against Milwaukee, preparing to throw three scoreless innings, the bridge between starter Max Scherzer and closer Daniel Hudson. The adjustment early in Game 6 of the World Series, at the behest of pitching coach Paul Menhart, to shake his glove in an effort to stop tipping his pitches to the Astros. And Hudson’s last slider to Houston’s Michael Brantley, the swing-and-miss that produced the final out of the championship. “It was just like: ‘Oh, my God. Oh, my God,’ ” Strasburg said. “That’s another feeling that I’ll just never forget. Probably never feel it, either.” Strasburg wasn’t always the easiest athlete to cover. He considered other parts of his job and preparation to be paramount, and chit-chatting with reporters neither helped him reach his peak performance nor fit his personality. His resting face registers as don’t-talk-to-me. Couple that with his massive frame, and he can be intimidating. So even with a town so invested in his every start (and every injury) over nearly a decade and a half, we didn’t really know him. On the way out, though, it’s clear how much he cared and how deeply he developed connections. His three daughters — 10-year-old Raegan, 7-year-old Reese and 3-year-old Rebecca — are all DMV natives, and the older girls have cherished friend networks here. When he signed the deal, he moved both his parents east because he wanted their lives intertwined with his kids’. Plus, he wanted them to see him pitch. That never really happened. So there were times during this winding discussion when Strasburg teared up. He believes he has so much ahead of him. He has already signed up for a role helping USA Baseball select this year’s under-18 national team. He wants to help his alma mater with fundraising to improve its baseball facilities, to which he has already donated. He could see himself coaching in college. And for the young Nats: “They all have my number. They’re welcome to call.” “It’s not like I’m sitting here like, ‘I’m just going to hang out,’ ” he said. “All I’ve been doing is hanging out. It’s terrible. My wife hates it. It’s like, ‘Get out of the house.’ ” Getting out of this house in McLean means leaving behind the only place his family has called home. So in the weeks before and since he sent Rachel and the kids west for good — his father has died, his mother is getting older, and San Diego made more sense — he took note of so many small things. The familiar guy at Whole Foods to whom he could say, “Hey, Kendall.” The coach in Raegan’s McLean softball league who delivered him a card with a note about how much Strasburg’s career had meant to the coach’s family. He struggled to tell some of the stories. The connections were mostly private. What’s public was the performance on the field. It was at times dominant. It was definitely incomplete. Strasburg struggles with that, too. “I guess the competitive side of me is like: Wasn’t good enough,” Strasburg said. “But I think I’ve always been really hard on myself. I think as a dad, I wouldn’t want my kids to be as hard on themselves as I am on myself. “So I have to kind of rework it, rework my [train] of thought. It might not have met other people’s expectations,” he said. He omitted that it didn’t meet his own expectations — his own astronomical expectations — either. That’s tough to wrestle with. But he landed here: “Man, it was a fun ride.” Fun, through the pain. Where Stephen Strasburg is concerned, choose the former over the latter, the fun over the pain, what he accomplished instead of what he couldn’t. That’s what he’s trying to do. It isn’t always easy, but he’s trying."
73,Andrew Golden,Parker’s dream start winds up a Nationals nightmare in loss to Braves,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/06/nationals-braves-mitchell-parker/,"Nationals rookie Mitchell Parker carries a no-hitter into the sixth before making one crucial mistake, and the bullpen does him no help against the Braves.",2024-06-07T01:28:19Z,"The outing Mitchell Parker put together Thursday night was one straight out of a manager’s dream. Parker attacked hitters and rarely fell behind. He worked at a rapid pace. And perhaps most importantly, he threw just 71 pitches through seven innings. The start checked all of the boxes that Manager Dave Martinez repeats before every game. And yet here’s why baseball can be so unforgiving. Despite all of that, Parker threw a four-seam fastball on the black of home plate to Adam Duvall that was barely a strike. And Duvall launched it for a two-run, game-tying home run in the seventh inning. In the eighth, after Parker exited, Hunter Harvey entered and recorded the first two outs. Then Ozzie Albies doubled, Austin Riley hit an RBI single and Marcell Ozuna launched a slider that caught too much of the plate into the seats in left-center. In the end, despite Parker’s efforts, the Nationals fell, 5-2, to the Atlanta Braves at Nationals Park. “All game, I had been getting him,” Parker said about Duvall. “So just keeping the same approach, attacking. He got a good pitch, and it’ll happen a lot. Good pitch, great hitter.” Martinez could have kept Parker in the game given his low pitch count, but with his best two relievers available, the choice was clear. It just didn’t pay off. At some point, Parker will have an outing in which nothing goes right and he’s exposed for the rookie that he is. Yet he somehow has continued to avoid the drop-off that typically plagues rookie starters as teams start to get advanced scouting reports. “What he’s doing really doesn’t surprise me because of how poised he is,” Martinez said. “He’s going to get the ball. He’s going to attack. He works quick. And he’s going to be in the zone.” Parker has made 10 starts at the big league level and still has not allowed more than three runs in any of them. It’s hard to find glaring flaws with the left-hander, who continues to show pinpoint command even though that was his biggest red flag when he was called up to the majors. He hasn’t walked hitters at a high rate — he has issued more than two free passes in only one outing. And it was even harder to find a weakness Thursday, even against a team that saw Parker on May 27 in Atlanta. In that outing, Parker pitched 6⅓ innings of three-run baseball for the Nationals (27-35) but allowed a homer to Duvall. On Thursday, Parker even flirted with history. The Braves (35-25) were aggressive early in counts, yet Parker kept them off balance. He didn’t miss many bats, but that didn’t matter. When the Braves did make contact, the result was weak groundballs or flyouts. They would throw their bats to the side in frustration. Parker finished with seven groundouts and six flyouts. And yet when asked about his performance, Parker said, “I mean, it was just another good start.” But it wasn’t just another good start. Parker had a perfect game going into the fifth inning, which ended with a one-out fastball that hit Duvall’s foot, and a no-hitter going into the sixth, which Orlando Arcia broke up with a leadoff double. And entering the seventh, he was still in prime position to go the distance based on his pitch count. He threw nine pitches in the first, followed by 11, eight, eight, nine and 13. And it seemed he would get just enough run support. During the first three games of the Nationals’ homestand, Washington collected 24 hits against the New York Mets. Twenty-three of those were singles, with a Joey Gallo home run the lone extra-base hit. That was one reason the Nationals were swept by a team that entered the series scuffling. Washington had only two singles through the first five innings against former Nationals prospect Reynaldo Lopez until CJ Abrams stepped up to open the sixth inning. Abrams has been mired in a slump that has lasted over a month. But when the Nationals are at their best on offense, it’s often because their star shortstop is in a rhythm. So it was only fitting that Abrams crushed a four-seam fastball in a 0-2 count into the seats in right-center field to give the Nationals their first lead of the evening. Abrams stood at home for a brief second to watch it, then started his trot. By the time he finished celebrating in the dugout, he looked to the field in just enough time to see Lane Thomas hit a solo shot to give the Nationals a 2-0 advantage. That lead wouldn’t last long, though. “I think we just got to build off those at-bats and get guys on in those situations,” Thomas said. “Two solo shots, you got to score more than two runs against a team like that.” After Harvey gave up the lead, the Nationals went down in order in the eighth and ninth, their struggles perhaps best embodied by Jesse Winker, who struck out to end the eighth, slammed his helmet on the ground and watched as it rolled along the first base line. “I thought once we scored that run and then Lane hit the home run, it’d be a trickle effect,” Martinez said. “It didn’t happen.”"
74,George F. Will,Electing prosecutors is a terrible idea. Trump’s conviction shows why.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/12/trump-prosecutor-alvin-bragg/,"Manhattan’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, campaigned for the job with a promise to go after Trump.",2024-06-12T11:00:45Z,"In his contemplative moments, if there are such, Alvin Bragg, Manhattan’s elected district attorney, should ponder a 1940 speech given by a U.S. attorney general. Before Bragg’s next pirouette on the political stage — at former president Donald Trump’s July 11 sentencing, where he will recommend a punishment — he should consider Robert Jackson’s thoughts on the role of restraint in the prosecutor’s profession. Bragg campaigned in 2021 promising to continue trying to hold Trump “accountable,” noting that in the New York attorney general’s office he had sued Trump “more than a hundred times.” In 2023, seven years after a particular Trump misbehavior, but just in time to influence this year’s election, Bragg indicted Trump for “34” felonies. One dead misdemeanor (falsifying business records; the statute of limitations has long since expired) was resuscitated and carved into 34 slices. These were inflated into felonies by claiming they were done to facilitate a crime. (Bragg often has a progressive’s penchant for reducing felonies to misdemeanors — e.g., some first-degree robberies are now charged as petty larcenies.) Bragg says: Trump used bookkeeping dishonesty in 2017 (about paying hush money, which is not illegal) to influence the 2016 presidential election. (A puzzling understanding of causation.) He was a candidate in the 2016 election he is accused of somehow illegitimately trying to influence. This violated a federal campaign finance law. (Enforcement of which Congress assigned to the Federal Election Commission, not to local district attorneys.) The 12 jurors might give 12 different answers concerning what Trump is guilty of. But what sentence might Bragg advocate next month? He is an elected prosecutor (a terrible thing; read on), with constituents to mollify — constituents mostly hostile to his defendant. (Manhattan’s vote went about 86 percent for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Biden in 2020.) He likely has higher political aspirations. He demonstrably seeks the limelight. So, he might be tempted to recommend incarceration. This, even though it is obvious that no one other than Trump would have been prosecuted under Bragg’s rickety scaffolding of quasi-legal theories. And even though no first-time offender not named Trump would be imprisoned for committing a felony that, even were it plausibly concocted, ranks among the least serious (Class E) felonies. Now, note Jackson’s 1940 warning, before he became a Supreme Court justice and chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. “The prosecutor,” he said, “has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America,” and “his discretion is tremendous.” He can have people investigated, perhaps with “veiled or unveiled” public intimations. He can order arrests, present cases to grand juries in secret sessions and secure indictments “on the basis of his one-sided presentation of the facts.” If his targets are convicted in trials, he can recommend sentences. “While the prosecutor at his best,” Jackson said, “is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.” This is why federal district attorneys have been presidential appointees, requiring Senate confirmation. This process is designed to produce executive and legislative branch expressions of confidence in prosecutors’ characters — “the spirit of fair play and decency.” Jackson noted that federal prosecutors have “now been prohibited from engaging in political activities.” A prosecutor should have “a detached and impartial” view of those in his community because law enforcement “isn’t blind.” The prosecutor has discretion to pick their cases; therein lies their “most dangerous power.” The prosecutor should select cases “in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain.” The law books, however, contain such a vast assortment of crimes, a prosecutor can pick a man “he dislikes or desires to embarrass,” Jackson wrote, and ransack the law books for a crime to pin on him. “It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.” “Reputation,” Jackson said in 1940, “has been called ‘the shadow cast by one’s daily life.’” Bragg has chosen a flamboyant life in electoral politics. He probably is impervious to Jackson’s wisdom, for a reason Jackson understood: “The qualities of a good prosecutor are as elusive and as impossible to define as those which mark a gentleman. And those who need to be told would not understand it anyway.”"
75,George F. Will,The Biden administration is the most progressive in U.S. history,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/07/biden-progressive-presidency/,Biden’s aim: minimize the market’s role by maximizing government’s role in allocating society’s resources.,2024-06-07T11:00:05Z,"Although climate change is supposedly an “existential” crisis, the threat to existence seems to be of secondary importance, given the latest depletion of government petroleum reserves to encourage low gasoline prices, and high gratitude among voters. The million-barrel release (one-ninth of the nation’s average daily use) will have no noticeable effect on prices. It is, however, congruent with President Biden’s “whole of government” approach not only to promoting his reelection, but also to the progressive agenda of swarming American life with government. Beyond serial student loan forgiveness, marijuana liberalization and multiple other mini-panders, Biden can truthfully boast that he has provided the most progressive governance in U.S. history. Two defining characteristics of progressivism are: the goal of minimizing the market’s role by maximizing government’s role in allocating society’s resources and opportunities. And confidence that the world is plastic to progressive government’s touch, and the future is transparent to progressives’ gaze. Having unleashed the worst inflation in 40 years, Biden is banning (through a 100 percent tariff) Chinese electric vehicles. This will keep U.S.-made EVs prohibitively expensive for most consumers, giving Biden a reason to continue subsidizing purchasers. Protected U.S. vehicle manufacturers will raise prices, enabling Biden to call this “reindustrialization.” This artificial (because government-subsidized) manufacturing “revival” will stop if the subsidies do, so they won’t. Progressives focus on jobs protected or provided by government, especially since the 2000-2015 “China shock,” although the Economist calls this supposed shock “insignificant”: “A plausible upper limit for American jobs lost … is around 2m. That is a small fraction of the size of the workforce (130m in 2000). Over that period people left jobs about 900m times … The vast majority found work again quickly … ‘Despite some localised hardships, the China shock is really a rounding error for the US workforce overall,’ says Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute.” The “shock” is the gift that keeps giving progressives an excuse to socialize the economy through government “partnerships.” While denouncing “tax breaks” for “Big Pharma” and “Big Oil,” Biden (notes the Cato Institute’s Chris Edwards) favors trillions of dollars for “Big Semiconductor, Big Wind, Big Solar, Big Battery, Big Automaker, Big Utility.” Automakers are now public utilities, whose future investments and product decisions are dictated by government. Twenty-first-century progressives preserve the shell of the (formerly) private sector as government’s appendage, but any vestiges of private autonomy are subordinated to the “existential” urgency of decarbonizing, which makes everything the government’s concern. Jake Sullivan — technically, Biden’s national security adviser; actually, a roving savant-without-borders — says government dispensing trillions of dollars is “not picking winners and losers,” it is merely picking “sectors vital to our national well-being.” This is a distinction without a difference because “well-being” encompasses everything. Biden says, more earnestly than grammatically, “Every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they are … and keep their roots where they grew up.” So, government planning will render geographic mobility, hitherto a source of national vitality and modernity, optional: Stasis is an entitlement. Already Americans are only half as likely to move between states as they were in 1980. Writing in the Financial Times, Ruchir Sharma, chair of Rockefeller International, says: “Something has been changing in the culture. Just as the American ‘revolution in pain management,’ which insisted on treating even moderate injuries with powerful opiates, was hooking the nation on OxyContin, its approach to economic pain management was addicting the system to a drip feed of government support.” In the 2008 recession, Washington “scattered relief like rain: unsolicited offers of help for companies large and small, distressed or not, hundreds of billions in cash to more than half the country, 170mn Americans, jobless or not,” Sharma says. A substantial portion to people earning more than $100,000. Republicans, whose leader calls himself “Tariff Man,” are complicit. After the 1987 stock market crash, the Federal Reserve under Republican Alan Greenspan promised to support financial markets, and joined what Sharma calls “the constant stimulus project.” And “the pre-Depression instinct to ‘liquidate’ weak companies in a crisis gave way to the opposite excess: ‘liquefy, liquefy, liquefy.’ Why not rescue everyone, all the time, when governments can borrow for free?” During the past three decades, Sharma says, the federal government, under both parties, eliminated a total of just 20 rules, while adding about 3,000 a year. Biden 2.0 would make matters even worse than would Trump 2.0, but it sometimes takes an ideological micrometer to measure the difference between today’s competing statisms."
76,Erik Wemple,"Brits are dominating American journalism — and British journalism, too",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/14/british-media-editors-us-journalism/,Why aren’t famous U.S. editors getting hired in London?,2024-06-14T11:30:28Z,"When The Washington Post’s CEO and publisher, Will Lewis, first met with staffers in November, he was asked to compare British and American journalism. “American journalism at the level of The Washington Post … is better,” said Lewis, a Brit who has worked at the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph and News International, a group of Rupert Murdoch properties. “There’s just no two ways about it.” What, then, explains the one-way nature of British-American trade in editorial talent? As noted just about everywhere in recent weeks, U.S. journalism has seen a fresh influx of British editors and executives, following in a tradition that famously includes New York magazine titans Tina Brown and Anna Wintour. There’s Lewis at The Post; Mark Thompson, formerly of the BBC and the New York Times, at CNN (chairman and CEO); Emma Tucker, former editor of the Sunday Times, at the Wall Street Journal (editor in chief); John Micklethwait, former editor in chief of the Economist, at Bloomberg (editor in chief); Keith Poole, a veteran of the Sun and the Daily Mail, at the New York Post (editor in chief of the New York Post Group); Joanna Coles, a British magazine executive, at the Daily Beast (chief creative and content officer). Now for the list of U.S. journalists atop brand-name British outlets. Uh … “I am struggling to think of a single editor of a major U.K. publication or outlet that is not British,” notes Mel Bunce, head of the journalism department at City, University of London. One British journo expert points out that American Albert Scardino served for a time as a highly ranked editor at the Guardian. Of course: Who can forget the Scardino Epoch? After browsing mastheads and leadership charts, I did find one stateside exec calling shots in Britain:  former CBS News honcho David Rhodes, who is executive chairman of Comcast-owned Sky News Group. In a call from England, Rhodes endorses British newsrooms as “robust” and cites only slight transitional challenges: “A few pronunciations and the fact that everything is plural,” he says. Rhodes’ title is quite a distinction: The United States racks up healthy surpluses with Britain on the strength of export goods like oils, machinery and lac — yet it barely cracks the British market for journo leaders. What’s the deal here? It’s layered. First: American editors are boring, at least in the view of the British media establishment. They’re forever crowing about accountability and transparency, assigning multiple reporters to Pulitzer-bait investigative series long on word count and short on pizazz; they’re resourceful at devising rationales for why stories should be killed or delayed. On the other hand, says former CNN commentator and British journalist Piers Morgan, the Brits “manage to combine ferocious hard work, creative minds, a dash of adventure and flair and a liberal sprinkling of British humor” in their work. That cultural gap works against the importation of American talent onto British mastheads. “There’s just no appeal,” says the aforementioned Scardino, 76, a Pulitzer Prize winner from Savannah, Ga., who has lived in England since 1993. “The British news industry doesn’t need earnestness. They don’t value honesty ahead of entertainment value,” continues Scardino, cautioning that the British media market does have some high-quality outlets. Second: American editors know America. British outlets cover the United States as though it were one big, racy social media post, in a thong. When even pedestrian stories break stateside, British newsies rush to put them atop their websites and newspapers. U.S. outlets generally don’t return the favor. The result is that British editors learn a lot about the United States over the course of their career — and not so much vice-versa. “I don’t think American journalists ever feel the need to study London,” says David Yelland, a 61-year-old British journalist who worked in the states, including at the New York Post, in the 1990s. “By the time I got off the plane, I might have been young, but I knew who Rudy Giuliani was, I knew who Cuomo was, I knew how the city of New York works —  the politics.  I knew quite a lot.” Third: You try breaking into the upper ranks of British journalism. “There’s still an awful lot of old-school patronage governing entry” to top editing jobs,  Bunce says. Elite feeder schools supply a great deal of the talent in London news outlets, she says, pointing out that leaders at the Daily Telegraph, the Independent, the Sun, the Guardian, the Daily Mail and the BBC attended either Oxford or Cambridge. Whatever their pedigrees, British editors cultivate communities of journalistic talent that tend to follow them from publication to publication — building loyalties that transcend ties to publications, Scardino says. So it’s no surprise that Lewis, who officially joined The Post in January, tapped former colleague Robert Winnett, deputy editor of Telegraph Media Group, as editor of The Post starting in the fall. (Asked about the hiring process at a recent staff meeting, Lewis said it wouldn’t be appropriate to detail the “ins and outs.”) The appeal of running a British media outlet, particularly in its newspaper sector, peers out from the stories themselves: No scandal is too petty for a write-up, British politics is bonkers, and there’s a run-and-gun exhilaration stemming from the cutthroat competition all around you. Hilarious headlines are mandatory. “We like to create mischief and we like to stir the pot a bit,” Piers Morgan says. Now consider the underside: Sleaze among Britain’s down-market tabloids, a strain of journalism that can infect the rest of the market. Books, essays, and laugh-out-loud news stories have been written about this culture, but all you really need to do is to click on a Fleet Street site or two, and the formula reveals itself. The work of British papers came under painstaking review in the so-called Leveson Inquiry, a 2012 probe triggered by the phone-hacking scandal that documented the ethical horrors of British newspapering. (An ongoing lawsuit in Britain alleges that Lewis, when employed by Murdoch’s newspaper arm more than a decade ago, covered up evidence of phone hacking. Lewis has denied wrongdoing and has insisted that he acted “to preserve journalistic integrity.”) The Leveson report cited a culture of “blagging” (using deceptive tactics to gather private or sensitive information), tormenting of families who’d lost loved ones, “extremely personal attacks” on people who dare challenge them; a “significant and reckless disregard for accuracy” on big stories; and, of course, phone hacking itself, an intrusion into folks’ most intimate communications. “Too many stories in too many newspapers were the subject of complaints from too many people, with too little in the way of titles taking responsibility or considering the consequences for the individuals involved,” the inquiry concluded. (Bunce says things have improved since the Leveson’s findings but that some problems remain.) Meaning, an American  editor in London would face a choice between scolding their colleagues about ethics every day or capitulating. “Not only would it be inconceivable that an American would run a British newspaper, they’d be mad to do it — the culture gap between the two markets is just too wide” Yelland says."
77,Amudalat Ajasa,"In the nation’s capital for heat deaths, new efforts aim to save lives",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/07/phoenix-heat-deaths-plans-preparation/,"After last year’s crisis, officials have outlined plans to try to reduce the toll, including launching a new extreme-heat preparedness plan and adding more cooling centers.",2024-06-07T12:00:10Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. By the time the patient reached David Sklar, an emergency physician at Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix, on the first day of June, his heart had stopped beating. Temperatures in the city peaked at 107 degrees that day, and the patient was experiencing heat stroke, his body temperature reaching 110 degrees, the physician recalled. It would be the first heat-related death that Sklar saw in 2024. The patient’s core temperature hit levels so high that organ systems failed. In Maricopa County, four fatalities have been confirmed so far this year in which heat either caused or contributed to the death, while 48 other deaths are under investigation. After a summer of extreme temperatures last year, there were a striking 645 heat-related deaths in the county, according to a report by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health — a more than 50 percent increase from 2022, and 10 times the number of deaths from 2014. As temperatures this week reach record levels in Arizona and other parts of the Western United States, Sklar said he is worried that another deadly summer could be underway. “Most of our deaths last year were in July,” Sklar said. “Here we are just really the beginning of June and we’re already seeing this.” After last year’s crisis, officials have outlined plans to try to reduce the toll, launching a new extreme-heat preparedness plan, appointing a state-level heat official and increasing the number of cooling centers meant to offer a place of respite. As this week’s punishing heat dome teases a potentially scorching summer ahead, the city’s plans will be put to the test. The National Weather Service has already predicted above-normal temperatures in the region for the summer, and temperatures there have already hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit multiple times this year. On Thursday and Friday, the Weather Service predicted record-challenging highs around 114 degrees. Last year, heat was the leading cause of all weather-related fatalities and injuries across the country, according to the Weather Service. The city’s main library is serving as an overnight cooling center. Other centers have extended hours to account for warm evening temperatures and will open over the weekend. A transportation hotline offers free rides to and from cooling centers. Experts have expressed concerns about the limitations and accessibility of cooling centers, especially for the most vulnerable populations — many are open only during normal business hours or are not open over the weekend. Nearly two-thirds of last year’s heat-related deaths in Maricopa County were people ages 50 or older, a group that includes people who may have trouble walking to or arranging transportation to get to cooling centers. A cooling center evaluation report from 2017 in Maricopa County found that nearly 55 percent accessed cooling centers by walking or using public transportation. In 2023, 75 percent of heat-related deaths occurred outdoors. The report also found that more than a quarter of cooling center visitors said electricity costs or unit malfunctions prevented them from using their air conditioner. This year, call centers, staffed by bilingual community health workers, will also connect residents with utility assistance and air-conditioning repair and replacement services for their homes, said Nick Staab, the assistant medical director at the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. “We need to make sure that these systems that we’re setting up are accessible [and] that the staff who are running them are trained in dealing with these special populations,” Staab said. In March, Arizona announced a chief heat officer to try to address the impacts of extreme heat across the state. Eugene Livar, first state-level chief heat officer in the country, said his goal is to facilitate the governor’s extreme-heat preparedness plan, released this spring, and to decrease the number of deaths throughout Maricopa County. “We know we’re not going to solve all the heat problems in six or 12 months. This is going to be an ongoing learning and tweaking approach that we need to have for the state of Arizona,” Livar said. Livar described the expansion of another effort for this year: 18 mobile, solar-powered cooling centers, retrofitted from shipping containers. Physicians and emergency officials in the area are already responding to calls of people experiencing heat exhaustion: dehydration, dizziness and heavy sweating. Emergency response crews in the region have begun using rapid cooling bags to treat patients before they get to the hospital. Geoffrey Comp, a Valleywise Health emergency medicine physician, has already treated multiple patients for minor heat-related illness and some heat strokes in recent weeks. The difference, he said, is that last year the heat spiked more rapidly. During the most recent bouts of heat, temperatures are building more gradually, which may leave the crux of “heatstroke season” yet to be seen. “Within the next couple of weeks, unfortunately, I think that we’re going to start to see patterns emerging like what we saw last year. It’s just been a little bit delayed,” Comp said. Sklar, who has been a practicing physician for more than 40 years, said there are two standout moments in his career: the coronavirus pandemic and last summer’s heat wave in Phoenix. “What I saw last summer was a remarkable and terrifying experience,” Sklar said. “Last summer was shocking. I had never seen the number of people coming in in near-death conditions from heat.” He said it was notable that as a country, “we haven’t really defined heat as a disaster the way we defined other natural phenomena.” He suggested that thinking about the impact of heat in that way may drive more resources to help. Last July, Phoenix set a record 31-day streak with highs of at least 110 degrees Fahrenheit. That month was the city’s hottest month ever recorded, followed by its second warmest August ever. An average of 13 heat-related deaths per day occurred throughout July 2023, according to the heat report. Sklar remembered treating numerous patients who came in with temperatures over 107 degrees last summer. Most were unconscious or had an altered mental status. Two patients died. Comp recalled trying to cool multiple patients at the same time, sprinting to get ice from the cafeteria for their immersive cooling method. This year, he hopes additional preparation will help them have a far less deadly summer. “But we need to be ready for it in case we start seeing the same temperature changes that we did last year,” he added.

Yet anecdotes, however outrageous, cannot capture the scale and scope of the heat that descended upon the planet this spring. By the end of May, more than 1.5 billion people — almost one-fifth of the planet’s population — endured at least one day where the heat index topped 103 degrees Fahrenheit, or 39.4 degrees Celsius, the threshold the National Weather Service considers life-threatening. On May 4, the heat index in Bangkok topped 117 degrees Fahrenheit amid a Southeast Asian heat wave that shattered temperature records across the continent. Six days later, Thailand’s Health Ministry announced that 61 people had died from the heat. The Bangkok metro area’s 18 million inhabitants are among the 111 million people who suffered at least 60 days of dangerous heat in the first five months of this year, a Post analysis of weather station records from more than 14,000 cities showed. Taken together, the cities included in the analysis are home to slightly less than half the world’s population, so the actual number of people exposed to dangerous heat is probably much higher. The heat index accounts for temperature and humidity to better capture the threats heat poses to human health than temperature alone. Exposed to a heat index of 103 degrees, a healthy person will probably suffer heat cramps and heat exhaustion, and prolonged exposure can cause heat stroke, according to the National Weather Service. Much lower heat indexes have proved deadly for vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those who take medications that inhibit sweating. When quantifying heat’s threat to the human body, it is important to account for humidity because it undermines our natural defenses against the heat. With more moisture in the air, sweating fails to cool us down as effectively. That makes it harder to regulate our core temperature — and it’s our core temperature, rather than the temperature we take with a thermometer, that gets us in trouble on hot days. “The heart really doesn’t like to get warmer,” said Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington, adding that about half of all heat-related deaths are caused by cardiovascular problems. Heat illness can also cause muscle spasms, dizziness, vomiting, headaches, confusion, fainting and loss of consciousness. Even able-bodied people can fall victim to extreme heat. “People typically are not aware that they’re getting into trouble with the heat until they’re really getting into trouble with the heat,” Ebi said. “You see people out doing activities where it’s quite warm, and suddenly somebody collapses.” As global warming has nudged temperatures higher, days with dangerous heat have grown more common. Bangkok’s 76 days of dangerous heat are a record for this point in the year, according to meteorological data beginning in 1979. It is also more than double the city’s average. Other cities follow a similar pattern. Lagos, Nigeria, for instance, has faced 13 times as many dangerous heat days this year than average. Below, you can see how the number of days with dangerous heat between January and May has risen in a selection of large cities. These cities are part of a trend playing out across the planet. Of 150 cities with more than 1 million people that face at least one dangerous heat day on average by the end of May, 135 have had more dangerous heat days than average this year. In the northern hemisphere, summer hasn’t even arrived yet in what scientists project could be the hottest year in recorded history, breaking the record set last year. Researchers have linked the rise in temperatures to the El Niño climate pattern and decades of emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Long-term projections indicate that future warming will also lead to milder winters, sparing people in the wealthy Global North. But in hotter, less wealthy countries — the places where people are least able to buy air conditioners, where poor laborers can least afford to miss work, where water is scarcer and the power grid shakier — summer heat will grow more dangerous. There is, however, a morbid silver lining to heat waves’ lengthening duration. When a heat wave hits, mortality starts to rise after about 24 hours, as people unable to cool themselves down at night begin to perish, Ebi told me. But after a certain point, the death rate drops. Those most susceptible to heat’s ravages have already passed away, leaving behind a population more fortified against the danger. “A healthy adult can handle more days. It may not be pleasant, but, frankly, people have done this for millennia,” Ebi said. “It’s the people who are more susceptible to heat who we need to think about. And as the population is aging and taking more prescription medications, the pool of people who are susceptible is much larger.” Niko Kommenda contributed to this report. To calculate daily maximum heat index, I downloaded hourly temperature and relative humidity records from Open-Meteo and applied the heat index formula used by the National Weather Service. My list of 14,079 cities and their populations was compiled from the GHS Urban Center Database and a list of smaller U.S. cities. Niko Kommenda and I estimated cities’ 2024 populations by interpolating between their 2020 populations and 2030 projected populations using an exponential growth function. You can find data and code I wrote to produce this article’s graphics in a series of computational notebooks: the map, the chart of six cities’ dangerous heat days since 1979, and the chart showing cities’ daily heat indexes this year. You can use the code and data to produce your own analyses and charts — and to make sure mine are accurate. To get in touch, email me and my editor, Monica Ulmanu."
79,Michael J. Coren,I swore off vegan cheese. Here’s why I’m a convert now.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/11/vegan-cheese-non-dairy-identical-real-food/,A new generation of animal-free dairy may be the first vegan food that tastes exactly like the real thing.,2024-06-11T10:30:00Z,"Scientists finally made fake cheese taste good. If you want to eat fake meat, you have a buffet of choices. That was clear as I wandered the halls of the Future Food-Tech conference, a gathering of foodies reinventing what we eat, in March. Scientists and entrepreneurs served up simulacra of beef, bacon, chicken cutlets and even ahi tuna. But it wasn’t until I stumbled across the cheesemakers, tucked away at the edge of the event, that my taste buds snapped to attention. In the booth of Berkeley, Calif.-based Climax Foods, black-aproned staff raced to replenish a cheese board for attendees, who snapped samples of soft brie and aged blue cheese almost as soon as they hit the table. I grabbed a slice atop a cracker and bit in. The familiar creamy texture and rich flavors filled my mouth. Assuming I was meant to test this cheese against a plant-based version, I searched for another set of samples. None existed. All these cheeses were made from plants. Traditionally, vegan versions of animal products have signaled sacrifice, not indulgence, even as they offered huge environmental benefits. Vegan cheese, in particular, has had an awful reputation among dairy lovers. Many have been hesitant to even call it cheese. But now a new generation of animal-free dairy may be the first vegan food that tastes exactly like the real thing — no sacrifice necessary. Don’t believe my unschooled palate. The blue cheese I tried from Climax Foods is served by Michelin-starred chefs at restaurants in New York and San Francisco. Nancy Silverton, a chef featured in the Netflix documentary “Chef’s Table” who runs two restaurants in Los Angeles built around the wonders of mozzarella, says a vegan alternative is now good enough to rival her fresh mozzarella di bufala. “The splotch and stretchiness, it’s exactly the same as the current dairy one,” she says. “This is something that’s going to really be a game changer in the market.” I set off to discover the secret alchemy transforming even the most boring ingredients into luscious cheese — and what that means for your cheese board and the planet. Delicious and creamy dairy produces a lot of emissions, roughly 97 times more than soybeans, calorie for calorie. And most of the world can’t comfortably enjoy it: Nearly 70 percent of the world’s population struggles to digest lactose, the natural sugar in milk, if they can even afford it. Animal-free dairy promises to deliver cheese for everyone. And it’s making remarkable progress. While ground beef, pork and chicken from Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are grocery store staples, they represent only 1 percent of the market despite more than a decade and billions of dollars in investment. Plant-based milks, on the other hand, already represent 16 percent of the liquid milk people buy in stores. Cheese could be next. “Cheese is now ahead of the game,” says food systems scientist Andy Jarvis, director of the Future of Food program at the Bezos Earth Fund, noting the field’s development has been accelerated by new ingredients and tools like artificial intelligence. “It’s like a cooking experiment on steroids.” (The fund was formed by Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post.) If you’re familiar with cheese with little or no dairy, you might like me have sworn off the category long ago.  Its tacky and disagreeable textures reminiscent of Play-Doh or orange ooze, along with a list of questionable ingredients including gums, starches and oils, had me sticking to real springy balls of mozzarella or the sharp tang of Wisconsin cheddar. But two major approaches are changing the game. The first is copious amounts of computing power thrown at identifying new ingredients and discovering combinations of plants that mirror the real thing at the molecular level. Climax Foods, founded by data scientists, is embracing this approach. If both cheese and plants are composed of fats, proteins, sugars and minerals, says Climax Foods CEO Oliver Zahn, why not skip the cow and make the final product? “This notion that the only way to make cheese is by using this heavily metabolized plant material that comes from an animal is completely bizarre,” says Zahn, an astrophysicist who spent years working for SpaceX, Google and Impossible Foods before founding Climax Foods in 2019. The company’s algorithms scour a database of potential plant ingredients — seeds, legumes, plant oils and others — for the desired texture, flavor, nutrition and cost. Over hundreds of iterations, the formulas are winnowed down in the lab — and on the tongue — a process the company claims saves “thousands of years of tinkering.” It ages the cheeses with bacteria and fungal cultures, similar to those used in traditional cheesemaking. Just as with traditional cheese, these microbes do the heavy lifting of converting fats into molecules that yield the creamy, nutty or funky flavors we know and love in standards like Parmigiano-Reggiano and Gorgonzola — and eliminating beany off-flavors that trouble some plant-based products. Another company, New Culture, uses a second approach known as precision dairy. It relies on microbes rather than cows to produce casein, a dairy protein that gives cheese like mozzarella its delicious, springy properties. You’re probably eating something made this way already: Everything from vitamin B12 added to your cereal to the enzymes for traditional cheesemaking, replacing rennet extracted from calf stomach, is made using this process from yeast. The company then purifies this casein, which is identical to the protein in dairy, and adds it to plant-based fats, salt, sugar, vitamins and minerals. “If you can produce casein without animals,” says Matt Gibson, CEO of New Culture, “you can make a cheese that is truly indistinguishable from conventional dairy cheese with none of the drawbacks.” The real test may come later this year at Silverton’s Pizzeria Mozza in Los Angeles. Customers kept asking for a dairy-free option, but previous nut-based mozzarella substitutes failed to impress: “As soon as it melts, you’re left with a mouthful of grit, a very unpleasant texture,” says Silverton. “It wasn’t a product I could work with.” After experimenting with New Culture’s early versions, the company eventually hit upon a recipe Silverton felt she could showcase on her most demanding canvas, Mozza’s minimalist Margherita pizza featuring just tomatoes, basil and melted balls of fresh buffalo mozzarella. The only difference, she notes, is the lack of lactose’s mildly sweet taste. Should you buy cow-free cheese?  You may already have. It’s appearing in grocery stores and fine restaurants across the country. General Mills, the company behind name brands such as Betty Crocker and Häagen-Dazs, has used precision-dairy milk proteins in its (now discontinued) Bold Cultr cream cheeses, as is Bel Brands’ Nurishh Incredible Dairy cream cheese. Climax Foods says it’s supplying high-end restaurants across the United States and, soon, retailers. Artisan vegan cheesemakers are popping up as well, from Miyoko’s Creamery, one of the largest vegan cheese purveyors, to local operations such as the Herbivorous Butcher in Minneapolis and Vtopian Artisan Cheeses in Portland, Ore. Many of these products are not being marketed as vegan. For example, Nurishh markets its cream cheese as free of lactose, hormones and antibiotics without mentioning the word vegan. For now, that’s mere marketing. Many of the products looking to cash in on “animal-free” dairy will probably underwhelm. But if they become both cheaper and indistinguishable in taste and texture from real cheese, a threshold experts say is fast approaching, they could displace many of the roughly 270 million dairy cows in the world. Then vegan cheese may no longer be called vegan. It would just be cheese."
80,"Simon Ducroquet, Shannon Osaka",The plastics we breathe,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/microplastics-air-human-body-organs-spread/,"Every time you take a breath, you could be inhaling microplastics. See how tiny and dangerously invasive they can be.",2024-06-10T09:00:00Z," For years, scientists on the hunt for microplastics have found them almost everywhere. First, they spotted tiny pieces of plastic in the ocean, in the bodies of fish and mussels. Then they found them in soft drinks, in tap water, in vegetables and fruits, in burgers. Now researchers are discovering that microplastics are floating around us. They are suspended in the air on city streets and inside homes. One study found that people inhale or ingest on average 74,000 to 121,000 microplastic particles per year through breathing, eating and drinking. “There’s just so much plastic around us,” said Sherri Mason, researcher and sustainability coordinator at Pennsylvania State University at Erie. “We wear synthetic clothes, and those are shedding microplastics. We work on synthetic carpets. We buy food wrapped in plastic.” Scientists don’t yet know the exact health effects of all those plastic particles — but their concerns are rising. In recent years, research has shown for the first time that humans are breathing, eating and drinking microplastics in much larger quantities than previously thought. And that plastic is burrowing its way into almost every major organ. Not only can those tiny particles infiltrate many parts of the body, causing inflammation, but plastics also have a laundry list of chemical additives: flame retardants, lubricants, solvents. These chemicals, in turn, can leach out of particles that have reached some of our most vulnerable organs. “I call it the spaghetti and the sauce,” said Heather Leslie, an independent scientist who was part of the team that first discovered microplastics in human blood. “The spaghetti noodles are the polymer backbones and the sauce is the additives.” Of the more than 10,000 chemicals used in the manufacture of plastic, scientists have identified over 2,400 as potentially toxic. As plastic production increases, so do the risks to human health. In 1950, the world produced 2 million metric tons of plastic every year; last year, it was over 400 million metric tons. Plastics, unlike other substances, don’t break down — they simply break up into smaller and smaller pieces. Of the roughly 8 billion tons of plastic that have been produced since 1950, less than 10 percent has been recycled. The rest accumulate in landfills, in the oceans or on beaches, slowly sloughing off into microplastics or even tinier nanoplastics. Some of those particles enter our body when we breathe. Here’s how plastics move through our respiratory system and become entrenched in cells, threatening our health. MICROPLASTIC When inhaled, the largest pieces are trapped in our airways’ mucus and moved along by hair-like structures called cilia until they are expelled through sneezing. MICROPLASTIC 10 MICROMETERS CILIA MUCUS TRAPPED MICROPLASTIC But smaller pieces can penetrate the body’s defenses. If the pieces are small enough – less than 10 micrometers – they can reach the terminal part of the lungs, the alveoli, where oxygen reaches the blood. LUNGS ALVEOLI They can linger in the alveoli for long periods, causing inflammation and potentially other chronic conditions. 10 MICROMETERS ALVEOLUS RED BLOOD CELLS Small microplastics, probably the ones below 2.5 micrometers, might take the same path as oxygen and enter the bloodstream.

CIRCULATORY Smaller microplastics can be attacked by some of the body’s defense cells, known as macrophages. But these cells, unable to break down the microplastic, eventually die.

For researchers, tracing the impact of microplastics on human health is a daunting task. Each chemical added to plastics, along with each microplastic shape and size, could have a different impact on the body. “They all have their own little toxic personalities,” Leslie said. “It’s an analytical nightmare.” But scientists have found some links. In one study in Italy, people with microplastics in the lining of their arteries were more likely to suffer heart attack, stroke or death from any cause. Another report found that people with inflammatory bowel disease had higher concentrations of microplastics in their feces. In laboratory tests on human cells, microplastics can cause tissue damage, allergic reactions and even cell death. The chemicals in plastics — like phthalates or bisphenol A — have also been shown to cause hormonal imbalances and disrupt the reproductive system. In mice, microplastics can cause behavioral changes and reproductive problems and can inhibit learning and memory. Researchers also recently discovered that certain cancer cells spread at an accelerated rate after exposure to microplastics; they are now looking into whether microplastics could help trigger early-onset cancer. Kimberly Wise White, vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs for the American Chemistry Council, said in an email that the plastics industry has committed $15 million to research into microplastics. The group is currently investigating inhalation of microplastics and possible toxicities, she added. Researchers warn that there aren’t yet studies showing a strong causal link between microplastics and a particular disease. People are exposed to myriad chemicals and toxins every day, making it difficult to identify what specific impacts microplastics have on the body. Scientists also still have yet to understand how long microplastics linger in certain organs and the concentration of the chemicals that they carry with them. Scientists are most concerned about nanoplastics — tiny microplastics that are less than half the size of PM2.5, a form of air pollution that has been shown to cause lung problems, heart disease and premature death. Until recently, those nanoplastic pieces were invisible with even the most advanced scientific tools. But now, scientists have developed new methods to identify them, which could upend what we know about the amount of particles inhaled or consumed by humans. A recent study found that because of nanoplastics, there are 100 to 1,000 times as many pieces of plastic in a bottle of water as previously thought. For now, there is little protection against microplastics or nanoplastics. While countries are working to hammer out a global treaty to reduce plastic waste in the environment, they have yet to come to an agreement. And scientists worry that in the meantime, microplastics are infiltrating our bodies with untold effects. There are no U.S. laws or regulations governing microplastics in the air or in food. “We’re really looking at the Wild West,” Leslie said. Experts say individuals can avoid some microplastics by steering clear of single-use plastic cups and bottles and avoiding plastic takeout containers. But those actions pale in comparison to the massive quantity of plastics added to the environment every year. And waiting for certainty on the health effects of microplastics could be dangerous. “By the time we have that full answer, we’ll have already impacted human health,” Mason said. “It’ll be too little, too late.” Additional video production by John Farrell and Justin Scuiletti.

81,Allyson Chiu,Don’t crank down your thermostat when it’s hot out. Do this instead.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/07/10/air-conditioner-recommended-settings-summer/,"Setting your thermostat too low will only strain your air conditioner, which already has to work harder on hot days, and increase how much energy you’re using.",2024-06-08T02:05:56Z,"If you’re seeking relief from the blistering summer heat, resist the urge to dramatically turn down your thermostat. “Definitely don’t do that,” said Jennifer Amann, senior fellow in the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group. “It’s not going to really cool your home any faster.” She and other experts say cranking down your thermostat will only strain your air conditioner, which already has to work harder when it’s hot out. It also increases your energy use, placing more pressure on the electricity grid and potentially contributing to blackouts or brownouts during periods of high demand. This summer is already shaping up to be another scorcher, with parts of the United States weathering record-breaking high temperatures amid the season’s first major heat wave. Around the world, more than 1.5 billion people have experienced life-threatening levels of heat this year. The extreme weather is raising concerns about power grid failures and exposure to dangerous heat. Here’s how to set your thermostat to stay safe and save energy during hot days. Adjusting the temperature 1 degree warmer, for example, can typically yield energy savings of 1 percent, experts say. “Particularly in the middle of a hot day, it can really help avoid reliability issues on the grid,” Amann said. Your home air-conditioning system doesn’t work like a water faucet, said Shichao Liu, an architectural engineering professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. When the indoor temperature is warmer than what your thermostat is set to, your system turns on, he said. But setting the thermostat really low doesn’t increase your air conditioner’s cooling capacity. “People think, ‘If I make the thermostat set point 60, I’ll get more cooling than a set point at 70,’ but that’s not correct,” Liu said. “You get the same amount of the cooling.” If you set your thermostat to a temperature that exceeds your air conditioner’s capacity, the system will keep running as it tries to cool your home to that point, he said. And continuously running your air conditioner guzzles energy and can shorten the life span of your system. One study conducted on the University of Georgia’s campus in Athens in summer 2014 found people reported feeling comfortable in indoor temperatures anywhere between 71 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. “If a person was in their house and they’re going to be there all the time, they could maybe turn up to 76 or 77 or so,” said Thomas Lawrence, a professor of practice emeritus at the University of Georgia who co-wrote the peer-reviewed paper. The study’s results suggest “most people will be fine with that.” “People should realize that if it’s really hot outside, having it at 77, 78, or even more, on the inside for a little while still feels good,” he said. When you’re not at home for extended periods of time, Amann suggested setting your thermostat 5 to 10 degrees warmer than what would normally be comfortable for you. Programming your thermostat to a higher temperature for eight hours a day could result in annual energy savings of as much as 10 percent on heating and cooling, according to the Energy Department. “If everybody who is away from home has set their thermostat so that they’re saving at least 5 percent of their cooling, then across all of the houses that can really make a difference in addressing that peak load,” Amann said. When you do a temperature setback matters, Amann said. “The most critical times to be thinking about really managing your AC load is in those peak hours in the middle of the day, those really hot afternoon hours” when electricity demand is high, she said. “That’s when it can be particularly important to do a setback if you can.” Keep in mind, though, that air conditioners are also critical for dehumidifying, which is a major part of keeping you feeling physically cool and comfortable. When it’s really hot out, you can feel warmer indoors even though your thermostat is set to a temperature that’s usually comfortable for you, Liu said. Instead of dialing down the temperature, use other approaches to stay cool, he said. Ceiling fans, for example, can be a huge help, and typically require little energy to run. “People don’t realize how much more comfortable they can be if they used their fans strategically,” Amann said.

82,Kyle Melnick,"Shark bites injure 3 in Florida on the same day, in ‘exceedingly rare’ event",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/06/10/florida-shark-attacks-beaches-cause/,Three people were injured by sharks near Florida’s WaterSound and Seacrest beaches. A scientist says sharks were probably chasing small fish.,2024-06-10T14:20:28Z,"After a shark bit a woman on her arm along Florida’s Gulf Coast on Friday, local officials transported her to a trauma center and closed a section of the shoreline to beachgoers, they said. But in what Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson Jr. later called an “exceedingly rare” day, that was only the first shark strike that afternoon. Less than two hours later, two teenage girls were waist-deep in the water on another beach in Walton County when a shark bit them, according to the South Walton Fire District. “This kind of incident can happen today, and then it might not happen for 20 or 30 years,” South Walton Fire District Chief Ryan Crawford said at a news conference Friday. The Walton County Sheriff’s Office said two shark strikes had been reported in the county between 2005 and 2023. The first shark strike Friday occurred around 1:20 p.m., when a woman about 45 years old was bit near WaterSound Beach, according to the South Walton Fire District. Part of her left arm was later amputated as a result of her injuries, Crawford said. The next shark strikes happened around 2:55 p.m. Friday near Seacrest Beach — about four miles east of the first incident, the South Walton Fire District said. One girl with injuries on her leg and hand was taken to a trauma center, officials said. The other girl had minor injuries on her foot and was taken to a hospital, according to officials. “These people were hurt badly — life-threatening, life-altering,” Adkinson said at the news conference. Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark research program, told The Washington Post that the presence of menhaden fish probably led to the strikes. Sharks chased and ate the small fish as dozens swam near the shore Friday, Naylor said, and some beachgoers who were enjoying the water happened to be in their way. “It's only when the sharks are feeding in waters where people are … that there's even the remotest chance that it happens,” Naylor said. While experts have said that movies such as “Jaws” have portrayed sharks as antagonists, they rarely attack people. There were 69 unprovoked and 22 provoked shark bites worldwide last year, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Data showed that more people died as a result of falling into a hole at the beach than from shark strikes between 1990 and 2006. Still, multiple shark strikes have occurred in the same areas before. At least four shark bites were reported near Long Island over two days last summer. Shark sightings have increased in recent years — a trend scientists have credited to conservation efforts. David Vaughan, South Walton Fire District’s beach safety director, told CNN on Saturday that the same shark might have bitten all three people. But Naylor said that Friday’s strikes probably stemmed from two different bull sharks, which are common in the area. He said one of the most unusual parts of Friday’s strikes were that they occurred in the afternoon. Most shark bites are reported in the morning or night, when their prey fish are most active, Naylor said. “Nine times out of 10, the fish are jumping out of the water, sharks are following them, and there's kids in the water,” Naylor said, “and the sharks ignore them.” Sharks might also accidentally strike people from confusion or curiosity, wondering what’s happening when they see a person moving in the water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On Saturday, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office said that its marine unit saw a 14-foot hammerhead shark near Santa Rosa Beach while monitoring the area but that the sighting wasn’t unusual. Hammerhead sharks are usually not aggressive toward people, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. County officials temporarily closed beaches to the public after the three strikes. When the beaches reopened Saturday, officials said they hung red and purple flags, which warn visitors of high hazards and dangerous marine life. The next day, they said, they lowered the hazard risks. Naylor said beachgoers are typically safe from sharks, but they could encounter one if small fish are near the shore. “When I see a whole bunch of little fish jumping out of the water close-in to the shore, it means that something’s chasing them, and it’s larger than they are,” Naylor said. “And it could be a shark. So I tell [people], ‘Hey, come on in for a while. Let’s give it half an hour until the fish stop jumping.’ ”"
83,Allyson Chiu,I shopped at a refill store for the first time. Here’s what it was like.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/06/13/zero-waste-bulk-refill-store-shop/,"Refill or zero-waste stores, where customers bring their own reusable containers, are becoming a way to reduce plastic waste.",2024-06-13T10:30:17Z,"With a Mason jar in one hand, I scanned the row of large glass and plastic jugs lining the wall in front of me. Each contained a different soap or detergent. The array was dizzying. It was my first time at a bulk refill and zero-waste shop, where customers bring their own reusable containers instead of buying products packaged in single-use plastic. These stores — which sell cleaning and personal-care supplies, dried foods, and more — are growing in popularity as a way to reduce plastic waste. Packaging accounts for about 36 percent of all global plastic production, according to a recent report by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonpartisan consumer advocacy group. “If you are eliminating packaging, which is such a substantial part of the waste stream, from your consumption habits, it can really add up and make a really big impact,” said Celeste Meiffren-Swango, one of the report’s authors. Online directories suggest there are at least 600 refill stores and mobile delivery services across the country, including two within a 40-minute drive from my apartment in D.C. On my first visit to one of them, I was full of questions. Did I bring the right containers? What if I made a mess trying to fill them? How would the weighing and pricing system work? How would the products here compare with what I usually bought? How much would it all cost? I had heard that shopping at these places might not be as convenient and might be pricier because it can cost more to source products that are environmentally friendly and aren’t packaged in plastic. Here’s what I learned. Before going shopping, I needed a plan. Meiffren-Swango suggested I think of all the times during my day that I interact with single-use plastic and focus on packaging I throw out once I’m finished with it. When I took stock of my apartment, I found plastic everywhere. All the products lining my bathtub — two types of shampoo and conditioner, three bottles of body wash, shaving cream and a body scrub — were in plastic containers. Toothpaste? Plastic. My face wash and moisturizers? Also plastic. A similar situation awaited me in my kitchen. A quick scan of my cabinets’ contents revealed plastic packages of dried pasta and resealable plastic pouches of quinoa and chia seeds. My dish soap, most of my cleaning products and my laundry detergent all came in plastic containers. Feeling overwhelmed, I remembered what Judith Enck, who heads the Beyond Plastics advocacy group, told me: “We don’t have to do this perfectly.” Instead, she recommended starting with items I use frequently. “There are some products you only use once a year. That’s not as important as the stuff that you use every day,” she said. I decided to buy the following: dry goods, laundry detergent, dish soap and a couple of personal care products. Armed with this loose shopping list, I headed out to Trace, a zero-waste store in Vienna, Va., about a 30-to-40-minute drive from my apartment. My usual trip to the grocery store is a roughly 20-minute walk. I found myself among a handful of customers milling around the brightly lit 1,200-square-foot shop. Aside from dozens of dried food dispensers, there were shelves holding spices, loose-leaf teas, and cooking oils and vinegar. The “Soap Station” with detergents, dish soaps and other cleaning products occupied a back corner near personal care items, including bulk face wash and lotion. These are the kinds of offerings you can expect to find at other refill or zero-waste stores, as well. 1/4 To minimize the risk of spills, Trace provides funnels to pour dry goods into containers. While dispensing quinoa, Mala Persaud, the store’s owner, instructed me to “go slow.” “Quinoa bounces,” she said as the stream of seeds pinged against the metal funnel. “It’s annoying.” As I watched another customer pull out one glass jar after another from her reusable grocery bag, I felt self-conscious about my plastic containers. I asked Persaud whether it was a faux pas to bring plastic into the store. “No, no, no, no,” she said. People can use any containers as long as they are clean. But she and her staff will advise customers on the type of container that might be most appropriate for a certain product. A dissolvable glass cleaning tablet, for example, can be dropped into an existing Windex bottle. I didn’t think of this beforehand and was forced to pump dish soap into a small Mason jar. An employee came to my rescue for the laundry detergent, suggesting I use one of the many empty minibar-size Tito’s vodka bottles the store keeps on hand along with other assorted containers for customers who might run out while shopping or don’t come prepared. She knew I just wanted to test the detergent and didn’t need a full jar. Filling my containers took more time than grabbing a packaged product off the shelf. After spending about an hour shopping, I left Trace with eight items, including pasta, laundry detergent, shampoo and conditioner bars, and toothpaste tablets. My priciest purchase: about 40 cups worth of loose-leaf green tea for about $18. My total, including tax, came out to $66.43. Looking at my receipt, I understood why some experts I spoke to highlighted cost as a barrier for many potential refill shoppers. The price per ounce of dish soap and detergent, for example, was about three times as much as what I usually pay for traditional brands: 47 cents compared with about 15 cents. The 5.4-ounce tube of toothpaste I usually buy for about $5 ends up costing roughly a cent per brushing, based on dentists’ recommendations to use a pea-size glob. In comparison, one toothpaste tablet from the small canister of 90 I bought for $14 comes out to about 15 cents per brushing. Refill store owners say some of their products can cost more because they are sourced from companies that have a lower environmental and climate impact and use ethical labor practices. “We try really hard to find stuff that’s made in the United States,” Persaud said. “Where it’s not possible, I try my hardest to work with vendors who visit their factories, or who know their factories, or who work with fair trade.” But Persaud added that certain items, such as spices, could be cheaper to refill over time because you aren’t paying for packaging. Others, including soaps and detergent, may come in more concentrated forms than traditional products, so you end up using less, said Rini Saha, co-owner of FullFillery, a refill and zero-waste store in Takoma Park, Md. The shampoo and conditioner bars from Dip, a New Jersey-based company, were the first thing I tried. I usually use Dove or TRESemmé liquid products, which typically cost under $10 per bottle. A full-size conditioner bar is $32, while a full-size shampoo bar costs $24. Kate Assaraf, Dip’s founder, said my initial pause at the price was to be expected. She said her bars are typically alternatives for consumers who use luxury hair care products. “I used to go through a bottle of really expensive conditioner a month, and I would spend $50 to $70 on just conditioner,” Assaraf said. “But now my conditioner bar will last me and my family about a year.” A shampoo bar usually lasts an average of two to five months, she added. The cost per use of these bars compared with traditional liquid shampoo and conditioner is likely to vary a lot because people’s hair-washing habits are often very different. I bought mini versions of the bars, $10 for shampoo and $14.50 for conditioner. I’ve used them for more than a month (I usually wash my hair two or three times a week), and I still have plenty of both left. It takes a few extra seconds to get the product off the bars — I alternated between rubbing the bar between my hands and dragging it across my hair. The shampoo lathered nicely, and the conditioner left my hair feeling soft. The Kaylaan toothpaste tabs were a pleasant surprise. To use them, you crunch one between your teeth and start brushing. I was skeptical that the chalky pieces would mimic traditional toothpaste, but they foam up similarly and have a light mint taste. Make sure you keep the canister’s lid screwed on tight. I spilled at least 10 of the tiny tablets — or $1.50 worth — down the drain once after accidentally knocking the container over. Because I bought only small amounts, I used the dish soap and laundry detergent more sparingly than I would traditional products. Both cleaned well. The soap was effective on food-crusted pans and had a fresh lemon scent. I used most of the mini Tito’s bottle of detergent on a load of sheets and towels, and my linens came out of the wash stain-free. While I enjoyed the refill store experience and the products I bought, realistically I wouldn’t go frequently given the drive. I could see myself stocking up on nonperishables or getting more shampoo and conditioner bars or toothpaste tablets once or twice a month. Next time, I’ll carry soap and detergent containers. For many people, switching most of their shopping to refill or zero-waste stores might not be an option. There may not be a store nearby. The initial price can be higher than that paid at major supermarkets or big-box stores, and these smaller shops typically don’t stock as many products. But experts say the experience offers the chance to think differently about how you shop — a good habit to develop regardless of where you buy your groceries. “Being in a refillery really forces you to think about how much you need of something because you’re paying by weight,” Meiffren-Swango said. “You’re kind of forced to be a more thoughtful consumer.”"

A number of studies in top scientific publications have suggested a warming planet will create more turbulence. But experts say that doesn’t necessarily mean more fliers will encounter it. That’s because airlines — with the help of weather forecasters — are getting better at anticipating, and, in many cases, avoiding rough skies.

Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. For the first time, researchers have detected a significant dip in atmospheric levels of hydrochlorofluorocarbons — harmful gases that deplete the ozone layer and warm the planet. Almost 30 years after nations first agreed to phase out these chemicals, which were widely used for air conditioning and refrigeration, scientists say global concentrations peaked in 2021. Since then, the ozone-depleting potential of HCFCs in the atmosphere has fallen by about three-quarters of a percentage point, according to findings published Tuesday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Though small, that decline comes sooner than expected, scientists say — and it represents a significant milestone for the international effort to preserve the layer of Earth’s stratosphere that blocks dangerous ultraviolet sunlight. As humanity struggles to control greenhouse gas pollution that has already pushed global temperatures to unprecedented highs, scientists said the progress on HCFCs  is a hopeful sign. “This is a remarkable success story that shows how global policies are protecting the planet,” said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a climate scientist at the University of California at San Diego and Cornell University who was not involved in the new study. Just over 50 years ago, researchers realized that a hole was forming in the ozone layer over Antarctica, allowing cancer-causing radiation to reach Earth’s surface. The main culprits were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which could destroy thousands of ozone molecules with a single chlorine atom and linger in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. The discovery prompted countries to sign the 1987 Montreal Protocol, agreeing to phase out production of CFCs. Under the terms of the agreement, rich countries would halt production first and provide financial and technical assistance to low-income nations as they also moved away from the polluting chemicals. Production of CFCs has been banned globally since 2010. But the most common replacements were HCFCs — compounds that have about one-tenth of the ozone-depleting potential of CFCs, but could still cause significant damage. The most commonly used HCFC also has roughly 2,000 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. So in 1992 nations agreed they would abandon these chemicals as well. “The transition has been pretty successful,” said University of Bristol researcher Luke Western, the lead author of the Nature Climate Change study. The United Nations estimates that the world has curbed 98 percent of the ozone-depleting substances being produced in 1990. It takes decades for those manufacturing bans to translate into fewer products sold and fewer HCFCs in the atmosphere. But Western’s research, which drew on data from two global air monitoring programs, shows that turning point has finally arrived. HCFCs’ contribution to climate change peaked at about 0.05 degrees Celsius (almost a tenth of a degree Fahrenheit), Western said, and their abundance in the atmosphere is expected to return to 1980 levels by 2080. “This milestone is a testament to the power of international cooperation,” said Avipsa Mahapatra, director of the Environmental Investigation Agency’s climate campaign. “To me, that signals potential to do a lot more, and it gives me climate hope.” Mahapatra said the success of the Montreal Protocol could inspire efforts to curb planet-warming pollution — which hit another record high last year. By setting clear, enforceable targets that were cognizant of each nation’s needs, she said, the agreement propelled people to take action while remaining the only treaty signed by every country on Earth. It is credited with helping the world avoid millions of skin cancer cases and as much as a full degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. But the work is not done, Mahapatra said.  Much as HCFCs were a flawed substitute for CFCs, they have now been replaced by a new class of refrigerants — hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) — that are considered climate “super pollutants.” Although the Montreal Protocol was amended in 2016 to call for a reduction in use of HFCs, they are often used in air conditioners, refrigerators and insulation. Ultimately, transitioning away from fossil fuels will be far more complex than curbing the production of ozone-depleting substances, Western said. The Montreal Protocol affected a relatively small industry, and it required companies only to change their products — not their entire businesses. With climate change, “You’re up against a bigger beast in some ways,” Western said."

Nothing seemed amiss on a warm late-summer afternoon in this laid-back beach town south of Wilmington. Surfers tested the waves rolling in from the Atlantic. Kayakers drifted across the sparkling bay just to the west. Bicyclists pedaled past colorful wood-frame houses with names such as Ship Faced and Sand Dollar Retreat. But even on this postcard-perfect day, a threat was lurking — one that is growing more disruptive, more often, in coastal communities in the southeastern United States: Sea-level rise. In a matter of hours, a particularly high tide would once again arrive in this town of nearly 7,000, overwhelming its outdated and overmatched infrastructure. The main drag of Canal Drive would once again become submerged by floodwaters. The Washington Post had set up cameras in multiple places along the road, capturing in real time the many ways that ever-higher tides exacerbate flooding, and why local efforts to cope with this growing scourge are often falling short in communities where seas are rising the fastest. The videos illustrate how, even on days without major storms, rising waters are compromising stormwater infrastructure, overtopping shorelines, elevating groundwater, and combining with rain to make flooding more persistent and more insidious over time.

Carolina Beach Atlantic Ocean Canal Drive Bayside To capture the flood, the Post installed cameras in five locations. Imagery and 3D buildings from Google Earth The images add to growing evidence captured by scientists who, day after day, are documenting the frequency of these sunny-day floods in an area where sea levels have risen 7 inches since 2010 — among the highest in the country, according to a Post analysis. In several coastal North Carolina communities, researchers have installed sensors inside stormwater drains and cameras along the streets above to record the causes and number of floods. In Carolina Beach alone, they have documented 60 days over the past year when Canal Drive flooded, many of those during clear weather. That’s far more than the four to eight high-tide floods projected by the federal government for the same period, based on measurements from a nearby tide gauge. Tide gauges designed to record changes in sea levels “are only painting part of the picture” of what is happening on land, said Katherine Anarde, an assistant professor of coastal engineering at North Carolina State University who is helping to lead the research. She and her colleagues, working to decipher a fuller picture in specific places, keep arriving at the same conclusion. “It is flooding more than we know,” she said. Two days in Carolina Beach— the first clear and calm, the second marked by rain — show why fixing the deepening problems of sea rise poses such a daunting task. As the tide rolls in, a stormwater pipe at Seahorse Lane steadily becomes submerged by salt water. The stormwater pipes and drains along this stretch of Carolina Beach were built generations ago, when they were above the high-tide line. But as this part of the southeast Atlantic coast experiences one of the most rapid sea-level surges on Earth, high tides regularly swallow the infrastructure that is supposed to drain city streets, leaving water nowhere to go. “The higher tides are lingering more often. When we do have an event, it’s multiple days,” said Jeremy Hardison, planning and development director for Carolina Beach. “There’s definitely more water in the pipes and drains than there used to be.” City officials have worked to combat the worsening problems, but it’s an uphill battle. They have installed backflow preventers to try to keep seawater from filling outflow pipes, though such retrofitting can have uneven results. The harsh coastal environment speeds wear and tear. Barnacles grow on the edges of valves, compromising their watertight seal. “Water doesn’t need much to penetrate in,” Hardison said. “In some areas, it has helped; in some areas, it hasn’t performed as we thought it should.” Local leaders also have mulled raising roads and building more bulkheads, he said. But such approaches can prove expensive, face regulatory hurdles and public skepticism, and come with the risk of unintended consequences. Outflow pipe Bayside 45 ft.

On this day, seawater eventually fills a pipe near Seahorse Lane, causing water to spew from a drain 45 feet away onto Canal Drive. As rising seawater fills a stormwater drain, the excess quickly floods onto Canal Drive. Besides overwhelming drainpipes, rising sea levels also push up underground water levels — commonly known as the water table. “As the sea level gets higher and higher,” Anarde said, “the groundwater table also increases.” That means there’s only so much capacity for the ground to absorb any rain that might fall. “So even just a minor rainfall event can lead to ponding in low-lying areas and just can exacerbate the flooding in the roadway or in yards,” she said. As high tide approaches on this clear day, puddles of water appear from seemingly nowhere in certain spots along the street and at the base of a nearby power pole and stop sign. As rising seas force groundwater to the surface, water starts to bubble up from cracks in the pavement. The most obvious manifestation of rising seas is the higher tides that more easily send water creeping over shorelines. That is what happens at this empty lot along Canal Drive — one of several places unprotected by a bulkhead. The incoming tide submerges a low-lying lot before spilling onto the main road. It pushes through marsh and across the once-dry land, turning it into a temporary pond. As sunset approaches, it continues to spill over onto the nearby street, covering it completely and making it impassable for many vehicles. In a handful of hours, this combination of factors transforms a long stretch of Canal Drive into a canal. And most of that flooding arrives swiftly, overtaking the road in barely half an hour around high tide. As dusk arrives, the water is more than a foot deep in places, despite the clear, calm weather. The city often must close the street to traffic on days with tides like this, said Hardison, the city planner. “It’s a given,” he said. Police officers arrive to lower a series of gates the city installed several years ago that warn of the latest saltwater intrusion. “Road closed,” the signs read. “Saltwater flooding.” A few drivers in trucks plow through anyway, sending ripples of water to lap off nearby carports and garage doors. As sea levels continue to rise, Anarde says, these types of floods will happen during more high tides, linger longer and cause only more damage. “It’s just going to get worse,” she said. By nightfall, the unstoppable tide stretches along Canal Drive and up side streets. Floodwaters creep up driveways and meander under some raised houses. Televisions flicker inside nearby homes, and the light from streetlamps dances across the water that has swallowed the road outside. A steady rain settles in over Carolina Beach. “When it’s high tide and it rains, there’s nowhere for that water to go,” said Hardison, the city planner. “If there’s nowhere for that water to go, then it’s going to back up and fill up like a bathtub.” Stormwater pipes again fill up with seawater as high tide arrives, leaving no room for rainwater to drain. Surging sea levels combined with even modest rains lead to what scientists call compound flooding, and it is happening more often in more places. Pipes that once would have drained by gravity are now filled with salt water, leaving no escape for precipitation. “The system gets overwhelmed,” Anarde said of the rain that falls hard along Canal Drive. “As sea levels continue to rise and we see tides propagating higher and higher, plus the frequency of these rainfall events, we’re going to see more-frequent flooding for a lot of communities — even at moderate or lower tides.” As darkness arrives, Canal Drive is once again submerged, this time even deeper than the day before. Authorities once again lower the gates to block the street. It will be hours before the floodwaters subside. Over the past year, researchers have logged dozens more flooding events along Canal Drive than official estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose scientists say high-tide floods in the South are already happening five times as often as just several decades ago. Federal tide gauges “are not actually intended to measure flooding on land,” said Miyuki Hino, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill environmental social scientist. It is a gap scientists are busy trying to better understand as this type of flooding worsens. “Measuring the floods correctly is a prerequisite for measuring the human impacts correctly,” said Hino, Anarde’s research partner. As time goes on, and the trend continues — seas are predicted to rise as much as an additional foot along this stretch of coast by 2050 — these floods will force hard questions in coastal towns. “Absent significant investments in adaptation, we’ll see a rapid increase in the incidence of chronic flooding relative to what we are seeing right now,” Hino said. And definitely not just in Carolina Beach. “A lot of coastal towns across North Carolina and across the U.S. are facing this problem,” Anarde said. “The last 10 years are not a good indicator of what the next 10 years will look like.” John Muyskens contributed to this report.

Over two days late last August, The Post set up cameras in various locations along Canal Drive in Carolina Beach to capture flooding during multiple high tides. Each camera took a photo every 10 seconds. The photos were combined in postproduction to create the time-lapse videos in this story. The Post’s visit coincided with a “king tide” — a term commonly used to describe some of the highest predicted annual tides at a particular location. These events occur several times a year in many coastal areas, and offer an opportunity to see what average water levels might look like in the future as sea levels continue to rise. Water levels measured in the Carolina Beach Yacht Basin The approach to capturing the multiple drivers of flooding was informed by conversations with Katherine Anarde and Thomas Thelen at North Carolina State University, Miyuki Hino at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Adam Gold of the Environmental Defense Fund. A paper they and other colleagues published in 2023 detailed how they used storm drain sensors and roadway cameras to determine that flooding in Beaufort, N.C., was happening more often than nearby tide gauge levels would have predicted. Researchers continue to monitor the impacts and causes of such flooding in multiple communities in North Carolina, including in Carolina Beach, New Bern and Carteret County — part of an effort known as the Sunny Day Flooding Project."
87,Shannon Osaka,This city just made it illegal to advertise SUVs. Here’s why.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/06/15/fossil-fuel-advertising-bans-edinburgh/,"Edinburgh became the latest European capital city to ban ads for aviation, SUVs, and more.",2024-06-15T11:00:00Z,"EDINBURGH — Last month this Scottish city — filled with medieval spires and shadowed by the looming castle on the hill said to have inspired the Harry Potter books — made a startlingly modern decision. Edinburgh’s city council voted to ban fossil fuel advertisements on city property, undermining the ability of not only oil companies, but also car manufacturers, airlines and cruise ships, to promote their products. The ban targeted arms manufacturers as well. Edinburgh is not alone. Amsterdam and Sydney have cracked down on advertisements for fossil fuels and high-emissions products. France also limited the promotion of coal, gas and hydrogen made from fossil fuels. Even the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, has joined in, endorsing a ban on fossil fuel ads this month in a speech in New York this month: “Stop the Mad Men from fueling the madness.” “There’s a moment happening here,” said Ben Parker, the Edinburgh city councilor who spearheaded the ban and a member of the Scottish Green Party. “It’s a way of saying fossil fuel companies and arms manufacturers are not welcome in our city.” A local ban on fossil fuel advertisements might seem minor at a time when carbon emissions — and temperatures — continue to march upward. But there is evidence that sweeping advertising bans, such as those targeting tobacco products in many countries, can change how consumers view and purchase certain products. The question is whether the new fossil fuel advertising bans are substantial enough to have an impact. “A lot of these bans that are being put forward are at the municipal and city level,” said Timothy Dewhirst, professor of marketing and consumer studies at the University of Guelph. “And partial bans have proven to be ineffective.” Fossil fuel producers counter that they are focused on addressing climate change. “Our industry is focused on continuing to produce affordable, reliable energy while tackling the climate challenge, and any allegations to the contrary are false,” Scott Lauermann, a spokesperson for the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email. Proponents of advertising bans seek to accomplish two goals: convince people not to use the product, and lower the reputation of an industry or company. Given how embedded fossil fuels are in modern society, some experts see the latter goal as more achievable. At the individual level, seeing fewer advertisements for gas-guzzling cars or international trips could make people less likely to opt for those products. “What you are doing is reducing the amount of consumption that is coming from those advertisements,” said Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute and a campaigner for fossil fuel ad bans. There’s evidence that this works. Starting in the 1970s, the constant drumbeat of new findings on the health effects of cigarettes triggered a lengthy process where nations restricted advertisements for cigarettes on TV, the radio and in public spaces. In the United States, bans began with cigarette advertising on television, and grew to covering the sponsorship of events, public transit ads and more. Today, dozens of countries — including the United States, China and the European Union — have bans, restrictions or other limitations on selling tobacco products. There is even an international treaty under the World Health Organization, adopted in 2003, that urges all countries to enact bans that target all forms of tobacco advertising. There are currently 168 signatories on the treaty; the United States has signed on the treaty but not ratified it. Research shows that those bans that block TV, radio, print and in-store advertising — as well as sponsorship of events — are most effective at stopping smoking, particularly among young people who have yet to start smoking in the first place. As of 2017, full bans were implemented in less than 20 percent of countries worldwide. But bans that are partial, such as those that only target TV commercials, are less effective. Companies may just reallocate their advertising budgets to other media, or shift to sponsoring sports teams and similar. “It’s like a tube of toothpaste,” said David Hammond, a professor of public health at the University of Waterloo. “If you press in just one spot, it just squeezes to another part of the tube.” Fossil fuels also present a particular challenge: While an individual can choose not to smoke, it is almost impossible to disconnect from an electricity grid that runs partly on fossil fuels. Ad bans can target some discretionary spending, like cruise ships and air travel, but oil, gas and coal are deeply embedded in everyday life. Parker, the city councilor, says that there are still reasons to target sources of global warming. “We protect people from things like gambling, alcohol, and tobacco,” he said. “Climate change is a different type of harm, but it’s still a harm.” Meanwhile, some advocates and scholars emphasize that advertising allows companies to shape their public image, which can protect them from stricter regulation. Researchers say that fossil fuel companies use ads to maintain their “social license to operate” — a shorthand for a corporation’s ability to be seen as acceptable by society and policymakers. By showing ads connecting their operations to clean energy, jobs, or energy security — and sponsoring popular events — fossil fuel companies can bolster their reputations in the public sphere. “Political scientists refer to fossil fuel advertising as a form of ‘outside’ lobbying,” said Geoffrey Supran, associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. “It complements lobbying inside the Hill and in state governments and so on.” Earlier this month, for example, the fossil fuel company Chevron sponsored the annual Congressional Baseball Game — which was interrupted by climate protesters. Robert Brulle, a visiting professor of environment and society at Brown University, says that advertising allows fossil fuel companies to help define the solutions to climate change — such as things like carbon capture from oil and gas plants. “They’re saying ‘We need to be part of the solution, we have the technical know-how,’” Brulle explained. In one study by Brulle and his co-authors, the researchers found that fossil fuel companies increased their advertising spending in response to congressional attention to and media coverage of climate change. Even if there were substantial advertising bans instituted for fossil fuels, it would be difficult to measure how such bans affect a company’s reputation. But some experts believe that it could make a difference. “It would be monumental,” said Supran. “It could loosen the stranglehold of the industry in a way that would politically and financially open the door to lower carbon technologies.” For now, ad bans are still only instituted in a small number of cities and nations worldwide — in a manner not so different from how tobacco advertising bans began. “It happened incrementally,” said Hammond. “It was a multi-decade process.”"

But Duke University is planning to shut down its world-renowned herbarium. DURHAM, N.C. T his wildflower bloomed in the low pine woods along North Carolina’s Tar River. The blossom, called a pink lady’s slipper, was plucked nearly nine decades ago — on May 16, 1936 — and stored away. This pair of pink lady’s slippers, picked roughly three decades later, in 1962, were in full bloom a few days earlier, on May 12. These from 1997 had blossomed by mid-April, a full month earlier than their counterpart 60 years before. By poring over nearly 200 of these pressed orchids, collected by botanists between 1886 and 2022 and stored in drawers at Duke University’s herbarium and elsewhere, scientists found that the flowers are now blooming 12 days earlier on average than they did 150 years ago. At this rate, the orchids may eventually bloom before bees are fully out and about, cutting the chances that pollen catches a ride to other pink lady’s slippers and that plants procreate. “The pink lady’s slipper is one of those iconic spring flowers that once you see it, you never forget it,” said Kathleen Pryer, the Duke biology professor who runs the herbarium. “It makes you happy each time you bump into it.” These sorts of dried plant specimens are one of the few ways to track the speed and scope of how humans are transforming the planet for plant life. In the midst of a worldwide biodiversity crisis, one that could wipe out up to a million species of plants and animals, herbaria captured the plant world before the onslaught of climate change, habitat loss and other human activity was fully apparent. Understanding how plant species’ ranges and physical characteristics have changed over time offers insights into what lies ahead for plants — and for humans. The Duke Herbarium is one of the biggest in the country, stretching back more than a century and covering the southeastern United States, a biodiversity hot spot where many species are disappearing. The collection sheds light on the past lives of an unusually large number of species, allowing scientists armed with new genetic and computing tools to compare them with their descendants growing today. Now the collection’s future is uncertain. Earlier this year, Duke announced plans to shut down the world-renowned herbarium, citing the high cost of maintaining the roughly 850,000-specimen collection of plants, fungi and algae. University administrators say they intend to keep the collection intact and find a new home for it within the next three years, though critics worry that there are few institutions able to absorb a collection of its size. Susan Alberts, Duke’s dean of natural sciences and one of the university administrators who decided to move the herbarium, acknowledged that the collection is “an incredibly valuable and precious resource,” but said it is time for Duke to find it a new home and invest university resources elsewhere. “It’s a zero-sum game,” Alberts said. “Nobody has infinite resources.” The pending closure has led to outcry from plant curators around the world, who say the loss threatens scientists’ knowledge of biodiversity. “Having a premier, prestige university like Duke de-committing to this resource — it’s just shocking, honestly,” said Charles Davis, a biology professor who curates vascular plants at Harvard University’s herbaria. For Kathleen Pryer, the loss is personal. As director of the Duke Herbarium and steward of this botanical treasure trove, she has spent most of her life tending to plants collected over a century around the world — flowers fastened to paper, mosses tucked in tiny envelopes, cacti stored in tiny cardboard boxes. This is where she has sought to inspire generations of budding botanists, and even where she met her husband. Duke’s herbarium will be the largest closed or relocated in U.S. history. “This is killing me,” she said. These dead-plant libraries can feel like a relic of an old way of doing science — akin to tromping through the wilderness to hunt animals for taxidermy. The first herbaria sprouted up in Europe during the Renaissance to train medical students and catalogue the unfamiliar plants explorers brought back from their travels. Today, there are some 3,600 registered herbaria worldwide, and that number is growing. But many are smaller than Duke’s, said Barbara Thiers, a former director of the New York Botanical Garden’s herbarium, and most of that growth is happening abroad. The creation of new plant collections does not compensate for the loss of old ones with records stretching back more than a century, which allow researchers to see if a species’ range and blooming patterns are changing over the years. Some prominent U.S. universities, such as Stanford and Princeton, have ditched natural history collections as scientists were increasingly studying the inner workings of cells under microscopes rather than focusing on the whole organism. In 2017, the University of Louisiana at Monroe moved its plant and fish collections to make room for sports facilities. Today, plant curators say technological advances mean herbaria are going through a renaissance of their own. Advances that have drastically lowered the cost of computing and genetic sequencing have opened up opportunities that are not available with other plant records, like field notes and illustrations. Researchers are trying to discover new species by writing AI programs to scan plant libraries and probe the secrets of evolution by extracting DNA from decades-old specimens. “There are whole new series of very sophisticated, highly sensitive scientific techniques that are now amenable to applying to herbarium records in ways that we’d never previously imagined,” Davis said. Some of the most powerful work done at herbaria involves uncovering so-called “dark extinctions” — that is, the loss of species scientists didn’t even know existed. Decades can pass between when botanists bring a plant to a herbarium and when it is determined to be a new species. The only way researchers know some extinct plants once existed is through the careful detective work of herbarium curators. “It’s the kind of thing that I lose sleep about at night,” Davis said. Pryer, born in Quebec, went to college at McGill University in Montreal to study animal behavior. “I wanted to be the next Jane Goodall,” she says. But after taking a botany class, she flipped to plants. “That switch went on and it was like, ‘These are my people, this is my thing,’ and I never looked back.” She came to Duke to pursue her doctorate in large part because of its herbarium. Aside from a six-year stint at Chicago’s Field Museum, Pryer has been here ever since. She teaches an undergraduate class about the importance of plants in society, called “Plants and People,” with her husband, Michael Windham. “We disclose it to students now when we teach,” Pryer said during a tour of the herbarium. “We may act like an old married couple...” “...because we are!” said Windham, who curates the herbarium’s flowers, ferns and other vascular plants. The pair said that many of their students are pre-med. “Even though we say doctors used to be botanists first, because they had to know their plants to be able to cure, they’re like, ‘Yeah, whatever,’” Pryer said. Recently, Pryer had some luck getting a young mind interested in plants. Kylie Dumaw, a Raleigh-area high school student, had read some of her research on genetics and reached out about helping at the herbarium. As a ballerina, Dumaw was drawn to the pink lady’s slipper. Along with Pryer and Windham, she is one of the researchers who pieced together the flower’s blooming history. “In high school, you hear the word ‘research,’ but I had no idea what that would entail,” said Dumaw, who is planning to present her findings about the orchid at a botany conference in June. “This herbarium can be used by so many different people for so many different purposes,” she added. “I wouldn’t have been able to do any of this if it weren’t for the herbarium.” Alberts, the Duke dean behind the decision to transfer the collection, said she knows how important Duke’s plant collection is — both in and outside the university — to understanding nature’s diversity. “It’s really important that we think about it as relocating rather than closing,” said Alberts, who researches baboons. “We see this as an incredibly valuable and precious resource.” But there are several reasons to relocate the herbarium now, according to Alberts. Several of its scientists, including Pryer, are near retirement. One of the buildings housing the collection is old and needs repairs, so a big portion will need to be put in storage somewhere else. “That creates a huge problem for hiring any faculty to study the herbarium in the short term,” Alberts said. It would take a $25 million endowment for Duke to keep the herbarium, she added. Alberts said she did not know yet what Duke will do with the 9,500 square feet of office space on campus it now occupies. She thinks these sort of plant collections are better kept by museums rather than academic departments. “That’s what natural history museums are for,” she said. “This is not a debate about the value of the herbarium.” Pryer, who was in the middle of discussions with a Duke alum interested in donating $1 million to the herbarium when she learned of the university’s plans, said there is “no substantiation” to that $25 million price tag. To boot, she and other critics note, Duke could afford it with its large endowment. Getting rid of the collection “makes Duke look like it doesn’t want to be a leader in biodiversity research and climate change research,” Pryer added. In response, Alberts said Duke’s commitment to climate research is “unchanged.” But when it comes to the herbarium, she added, “there is no way back from this decision.” Botanists across the country have protested the decision, penning op-eds, journal articles and an online petition endorsed by six science societies that drew more than 19,000 signatures. “We’re not just keeping these around because they’re quaint and pretty,” said Thiers, who tracks herbaria and used to run the country’s largest. “We’re just barely scratching the surface of what we can do.” Alberts and other university administrators are committed to keeping the collection together. But advocates for the Duke Herbarium say a collection as big as Duke’s may have to sit in storage while a new facility is being prepared, risking damage to delicate plants from insects or fungi. A relocation of this size is also prone to having specimens misplaced and lost forever, endangering future research on how plants are adapting to human-driven climate change. None of the institutions capable of taking on Duke’s collection have yet stepped forward. “I can’t think of any that have just moved into some new facility where they could just easily incorporate that many specimens,” Thiers said. Ever since the closure announcement, Pryer has fielded hundreds of emails from researchers, with some asking for specimens. Granting those requests would mean splitting up the collection. “That would be really the most horrific thing that could happen,” Pryer said. If Duke goes through with its decision, the task of packing up the specimens for their new home would fall to her and her staff. She knows how important it is to preserve the collection but can’t bring herself to send away her life’s work. “I did not get up to my golden years here to be packing up specimens and destroying a legacy … I won’t be part of that.” Photos by Kate Medley.

These are the best foods to eat during a heat wave, and what to avoid eating in extreme heat.",2024-06-08T01:47:55Z,"If you’re trying to beat the heat this summer, you might want to reconsider what you’re eating and drinking. With parts of the country already experiencing record-breaking temperatures, experts say making sure that you’re properly hydrated and your body has enough energy is essential to helping you weather the physical toll of extreme heat. Here are some do’s and don’ts. Eat big heavy meals. Digestion creates heat, and consuming large amounts of rich foods in one sitting can be difficult for the body to break down, said Leigh A. Frame, director of integrative medicine at George Washington University. “If you’re struggling to digest food, your body’s actually creating more heat.” Eating a heavy meal when it’s really hot out can also make you feel more sluggish and tired because your body is trying to do too much at once, said Cecilia Sorensen, director of the Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education at Columbia University. Instead, experts recommend eating lighter meals more frequently throughout the day and focusing on hydrating foods that can be easier to digest, such as cucumber and watermelon. “That is going to make people have more energy and not feel as fatigued during the heat,” Sorensen said. Consume too much caffeine. Drinks with large amounts of caffeine, such as energy drinks, can be dehydrating because they make you urinate more. “It depends on the amount of caffeine in them. For instance, the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee is not that much,” Frame said. Think ice-cold foods and drinks are the solution. Cooling down on a hot day with ice cream, Popsicles or an icy drink might give you temporary relief. “It’s not like you can be out in the hot, hot sun and humidity and just eat cold foods and be okay,” said Nate Wood, a chef and instructor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. And consuming a lot of cold foods or drinks in a single day could lower your core temperature, Frame said. Your body might respond by trying to heat itself back up, which could drain your energy and make you feel warmer in the long run, she said. Additionally, most ice cream contains dairy, which can be difficult for many people to digest. “It would be better to use a cold compress on the back of your neck rather than trying to ice yourself from the inside out,” she said. Eat fruits and vegetables. Food can be a major source of hydration. Unlike processed foods, which typically don’t contain much water and can be harder to digest, many fruits and vegetables are full of water and nutrition. Experts recommend eating produce with high water content, such as berries, watermelon, cucumbers, tomatoes, celery and bell peppers. While lettuce is known to contain a lot of water, Wood said darker greens such as kale and spinach can also be hydrating. These foods have the added benefit that they don’t need to be cooked, so you can reduce the amount of heat generated inside your home. Hydrate properly. Plain water and low-sugar, caffeine-free drinks are ideal, experts say. Unless you’re playing a sport or exercising, you probably don’t need an electrolyte drink, which often has added sugar. But it’s important to avoid drinking too much water. Guzzling water could cause a potentially fatal condition known as hyponatremia, which occurs when the sodium in your body becomes diluted and levels drop abnormally low. Aside from feeling thirsty, the best way to know if you’re properly hydrated is to assess the color of your urine, Frame said. “If it is a very pale yellow, like the color of light lemon juice, you are hydrated. If it is any darker than that, then you are dehydrated.” Think about balance. Avoid making drastic changes to your diet, experts said. Beyond hydration, your body needs calories. Supplement hydrating foods with things that are higher in unsaturated or healthy fats and lean proteins, Wood said. Keep in mind that if you suddenly start eating more fruits and vegetables than you have before, your body could react poorly, he said. For example, eating way more fiber than you’re used to could cause gastrointestinal issues such as bloating and cramping and changes to your bowel movements, he said. “One of the best things people can do is just kind of like start adopting these types of lifestyle and dietary modifications chronically, because these are healthy for us anyway,” Wood said. “Then, when the time comes where that becomes really important for literal survival, if not just comfort, you’re kind of already acclimated to doing those things and it’s not such a shock to the body.”  Use our tracker to see your city’s extreme heat risk.

90,Nicolás Rivero,Linen or cotton: Which fabric keeps you cooler in sticky summer heat?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/06/08/linen-cotton-summer-heat-cool/,"As the summer heats up, we asked three fabric scientists to explain why linen keeps our bodies cooler than cotton.",2024-06-08T11:00:00Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. A white cotton T-shirt and a linen button-down are both classic summer looks. But which of these fabrics will keep you cooler on a hot, humid day? We spoke to three textile scientists who study fabrics and fibers on a molecular level to get a definitive, scientific answer about the most comfortable clothing material for hanging out on a summer afternoon. Their unanimous verdict: Linen will keep you cooler. All three scientists agreed that if you’re working or exercising in the sun, you’d be better off in synthetic fabrics such as polyester that have been chemically treated to wick sweat away from your skin as fast as possible. But if athletic wear isn’t an option, linen offers the best combination of moisture removal and airflow. “Linen is much better in terms of providing comfort,” said Sundaresan Jayaraman, a professor of material science and engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “People worry about perfect storms. Linen is what I would call a positive storm because everything is nicely coming together.” When it’s hot out, your body’s main tool for cooling itself down is sweating. As sweat evaporates from your skin, it carries away heat. So in the summer, it’s important to wear a fabric that helps your body get rid of moisture. “Your comfort is determined by how much body moisture is being released,” said Yiqi Yang, a professor of textile science at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. 1/2 You want a fabric that’s absorbent enough to pull moisture away from your skin, but also allows the water to evaporate into the air. Cotton and linen are both very absorbent — but cotton retains water while linen lets it go, according to Jayaraman. “If you happen to be walking on a hot, humid day wearing a cotton undershirt, by the time you get home, the undershirt is completely wet because it is capturing all the sweat from you, but it does not have the ability to transport the moisture vapor from your garment to the outside world,” he said. “That’s why you feel clammy.” You can see why cotton and linen behave differently when you put their fibers under a microscope, said Larissa Marie Shepherd, an assistant professor of fiber science at Cornell University. Cotton fibers, which come from the fuzzy bolls that swaddle cotton seeds, look like ribbon and tend to be full of kinks, twists and bends. Linen fibers, which come from the stems of long, tall flax stalks, look more like bamboo rods and tend to be straighter and stiffer. “The ribbon shape of cotton can trap water more,” Shepherd said. “Flax is straight, so there’s not as many places for the water to be trapped inside.” Your body also sheds heat when cool air flows over your skin — so on a hot day, you want to wear a fabric that breathes. Linen also has an advantage here, Jayaraman says. Its fibers are thicker than cotton’s, so linen fabrics tend to have a lower thread count and more openings between fibers. “That means air can more easily pass through,” he said. But thread counts can vary widely from garment to garment. Shepherd said you should judge the fabric for yourself. “If you can see light through it, then water and air can penetrate through it,” she said. Linen’s other big advantage is its stiffness. Rigid linen fibers tend to hold their shape better than cotton, causing linen clothing to hang away from your body while cotton clothing tends to cling to your skin. Leaving more space for air to flow between your clothes and your skin cools you down and helps sweat evaporate. While linen is, scientifically, a cooler fabric than cotton, that’s not the only factor you have to consider when picking out clothes. For instance, linen’s stiffness — which is so helpful for letting air flow over your skin — might rub some people the wrong way. “Someone might be more comfortable with cotton because it feels nicer. It’s a bit softer,” Shepherd said. “So that comes down to personal preference.” Linen’s stiffness also makes it prone to wrinkles, requiring more ironing — unless you want to go for a rumpled look. “The wrinkles can make a fashion statement about being a cool guy, pun intended,” Jayaraman said. “Sometimes the stylish selection goes against comfort. It’s just about what is more important to you,” Yang said. “But I’m a chemical engineer, so unfortunately I know nothing about fashion.”"
91,Dino Grandoni,This word was rejected by geologists. But it’s already taken over the world.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/10/anthropocene-epoch-human-climate-impacts/,A panel of scientists rejected the term “Anthropocene” to describe a period in which humans have profoundly impacted the environment — but others keep using it.,2024-06-10T10:30:00Z,"Key takeaways Summary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed. Did our AI help? Share your thoughts. What do you call the current time period — when we humans are warming the atmosphere, acidifying the oceans, altering the land and leaving a literal mark on the planet? Not the Anthropocene, according to geologists who rejected the idea of adding a new epoch to Earth’s official geological timeline. Yet for many activists, artists and academics outside of geology, the Anthropocene, or “Age of Humans,” is here to stay, regardless of what rock specialists have to say. Earlier this year, a panel of geologists rejected a proposal to officially designate the past seven decades, during which humans profoundly impacted the environment, as the new chapter in the planet’s history. But as these scientists spent years debating, the term became widely adopted outside geology to encapsulate the angst around environmental degradation — popping up in book titles, music albums and art exhibitions. For the term’s proponents, the idea that humanity has pushed the Earth into a new geological epoch should serve as a wake-up call. “It’s only been 70 years,” said Francine McCarthy, a professor of earth science at Brock University in Ontario, referring to the start of the new proposed epoch. “We don’t have another 70 years to wait.” The name’s persistence speaks to a need for a cultural shorthand for referring to the big, complex ecological changes that are defining the present era, advocates say — something akin to terms like the Cold War or the Internet Age that came before it. Even if geologists say they cannot pinpoint its exact start, it is obvious to many who continue to use the term that the Anthropocene has begun. “I always thought that this geological discussion was perhaps too soon,” said ecologist Inês Martins, whose employer — the Leverhulme Center for Anthropocene Biodiversity at the University of York — has embraced the term. “But the reality is it is a very useful concept to use to identify an era where humans have increased their impacts.” The term burst into public consciousness in 2000, when the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen suggested the global effect of human activities was so profound that Earth was no longer in the Holocene, the current geological epoch. “I was at a conference where someone said something about the Holocene, the long period of relatively stable climate since the end of the last ice age,” Crutzen recalled years later to the author Fred Pearce. “I suddenly thought that this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: ‘No, we are in the Anthropocene.’ I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked.” The coinage is a combination of the prefix “anthropo-,” which comes from the Greek word for human, and suffix “-cene,” derived from the Greek for “new” or “recent.” The five most recent epochs all deploy “-cene” but lack the specificity of Crutzen’s new name, according to Merriam-Webster, with names simply referring to how far in the past each is. Crutzen, who died in 2021, knew a thing or two about humans degrading the atmosphere, having won his Nobel for his work explaining how pollution was stripping Earth’s protective ozone layer. Earthbound geologists took his idea seriously. In 2009, a scientific body called the International Commission on Stratigraphy appointed a working group to search for a so-called “golden spike” for the new epoch — a literal place on Earth where the rock record shows a clear transition from one ancient time to the next. For example, the Jurassic period, famous for its dinosaurs, is named after the Jura Mountains in Europe. Scientists have put forward plenty of possible start dates. Crutzen himself suggested the second half of the 18th century, as greenhouse gases accumulated in glacial ice. The official Anthropocene Working Group proposed a spike in plutonium found in the mud of Crawford Lake in Canada, the result of nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s. McCarthy, who studies the lake and argues that a plutonium-laced layer of sediment built up on its bottom should serve as a new “golden spike,” said the fact that the Anthropocene began so recently should send a sobering message to society to act fast to slow climate change. “That’s the scary part, is how quickly we have come to this point.” But in a contested vote in March, a subpanel of the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the group charged with dividing the planet’s history into units that correspond with the geologic record, rejected that proposal, with some members arguing that such a recent feature should not define an epoch. Under its rules, geologists cannot submit another Anthropocene proposal for at least 10 years. “Sediment deposited within my lifetime is not a new epoch, by any standards,” said Philip Gibbard, a University of Cambridge geologist who voted against the official Anthropocene proposal. Golden spike or no golden spike, the Anthropocene isn’t going anywhere. In a statement after the vote, the International Commission on Stratigraphy acknowledged the term will “continue to be used not only by Earth and environmental scientists, but also by social scientists, politicians and economists, as well as by the public at large.” “It will remain an invaluable descriptor of human impact on the Earth system,” the commission added. Even the term’s critics admit it has staying power. “The term Anthropocene is unfortunately here to stay,” Gibbard said. “The cat’s out of the bag. The horse has bolted. We can’t stop it.” If anything, all the headlines on the rejection have only heightened the public’s awareness of the term. “It is definitely drawing more attention” to it, said McCarthy. “Even those people who are against — the no vote people — most of them would probably agree that we are in the Anthropocene,” she added. The term is being searched for online about as much in the months since the March decision as it was during the months prior, according to Google Trends, and is still popping up in scientific studies, including in the prestigious journal Nature. “It’s a good term that explains what we do to the planet,” said climatologist Jan Esper, who wrote a recent Nature paper that found that the summer of 2023 was the hottest in the Northern Hemisphere in 2,000 years. The evolution of the concept is still underway. Norman Wirzba, a professor of theology at Duke Divinity School, said the name Anthropocene may imply that all of humanity is responsible for climate change, even though a handful of countries are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. “The question is, why are we calling this the Anthropocene when it’s very clear that what really made this happen was capitalism?” said Wirzba, who noted an alternative name for the current epoch: the “Capitalocene.” “To lump all of humanity together,” he added, “is not discriminating enough.” Gibbard, the geologist, has another idea. He wishes for the Anthropocene to be regarded as an ongoing “event,” a term used in geology to describe ancient episodes that leave a mark in the rocks. Geological events can be something as simple as a footprint left in the mud or as cataclysmic as a volcanic eruption. For science to work, Gibbard said, researchers need to agree on what words mean. “It would be most unsatisfactory if we had a term that could not be used, or is being used, in different ways in different disciplines,” he said. But he added that no geologist is in a position to stop people from using words how they wish. “We are not policemen. It is not our job to police the language.” But for others, the term’s vagueness is exactly what gives it strength. “We all as a community of citizens of planet Earth decided that this was a word to refer to the age of humanity, and the flexibility that different groups brought to that term really gave it a lot of power,” said Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. “The fact that the Anthropocene has eluded definition is a feature and not a bug.” “Geologists and stratigraphers don’t own the concept,” she added. “People can just walk outside, and they recognize we’re in the Anthropocene.”"
92,Sarah Raza,"Big stethoscope, tiny mouse: Watch a rodent prep to go into the wild",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/14/hazel-dormice-endangered-species-conservation/,Hazel dormice are imperiled in Great Britain and have gone extinct elsewhere. But a years-long effort to rebuild their numbers holds hope.,2024-06-14T11:00:00Z,"Hazel dormice are tiny rodents, named for the hazelnuts they eat to fatten up for their winter hibernation. While the UK still has plenty of hazelnuts, the same is not true for these once-common golden-brown mice, which have disappeared from many parts of the country. This month, conservationists released ten hazel dormice back into the wild in an effort to rebuild its populations and save the native species from extinction. In a video shared by ZSL — the Zoological Society of London — wildlife veterinarians used stethoscopes to check each mouse’s heart and lungs, and the mice received a clean bill of health before their release. Each dormouse is no bigger than the palm of one’s hand, and can weigh just 20 grams. Hazel dormice populations have declined 70 percent across the country since 2000, according to the ZSL, and gone extinct in 17 counties. This is due to habitat loss, woodland mismanagement, climate change and other factors. So in partnership with local groups, ZSL conservationists began breeding the species in captivity. In the last 30 years, they have successfully reintroduced over 1,000 dormice into woodlands across the country, and decades later, the dormice are thriving in their habitats. “Dormice are not only an iconic UK species, but they’re also a flagship species,” said Georgina Gerard, the disease risk analysis and health surveillance project manager at ZSL. That means restoring dormice populations will also promote woodland recovery and help the native species that live alongside them, she said. Hazel dormice are nocturnal creatures, and along with hazelnuts, their diet includes berries, seeds, flowers, pollen, as well as some insects. These ten dormice spent eight weeks in quarantine at ZSL, where veterinarians ensured they were healthy and would not transfer any disease to local species. They were then taken to their secret release site in Bedfordshire. For now, they will stay in soft cages to allow them to acclimate to their environment, and in a week after a final health check, they will be free to roam and explore their new habitat. This year’s release aims to create a bigger and more genetically diverse population of dormice, Gerard said. Conservationists will continue to monitor their health and adaptation to the environment."

The protections, which ensure workers can report any meddling without fear of “retribution, reprisal, or retaliation,” are “a way for us to get in front of a second Trump administration and protect our workers,” said Marie Owens Powell, an EPA gas station storage tank inspector and president of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 238. The agreement signals the extent to which career employees and Biden administration officials are racing to foil any efforts to interfere with climate science or weaken environmental agencies should former president Donald Trump win a second term. Trump and his allies, in contrast, argue that bloated federal agencies have hurt economic development nationwide and that the Biden administration has prioritized climate science at the expense of other priorities. “One of the things that is so bad for us is the environmental agencies. They make it impossible to do anything,” the former president said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” that aired June 2, claiming that “they’ve stopped you from doing business in this country.” The Trump administration sidelined, muted or forced out hundreds of scientists and misrepresented research on the coronavirus, reproduction and hurricane forecasting, environmental advocates said. Now as an example of what’s to come, they point to a blueprint called “Project 2025,” a plan for the next conservative administration drafted by right-wing think tanks in Washington. The plan calls for a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch, one that would concentrate more power in Trump’s hands. At the EPA, it recommends eliminating the office of environmental justice, which was created in 2022 to address the pollution that disproportionately harms poor and minority communities. Soon after President Biden took office, his administration began imposing scientific integrity policies across the federal government, setting rules that protect research from political interference or manipulation. Many such policies are in place — though research advocates say they aren’t durable because they aren’t enshrined in federal law, and could be undone with new executive actions. At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where a 2020 investigation found that agency leaders violated its scientific integrity policy after Trump showed a doctored hurricane forecast map, stricter standards took effect in March. A similar policy will soon be extended to the Commerce Department, including to the political appointees whose violations were detailed in the 2020 probe. At the EPA, the new scientific integrity provision is part of a four-year contract with the agency. The provision ensures that workers’ complaints will be assessed by an independent investigator, rather than a political appointee. While any new president could quickly transform policies around scientific integrity through new executive orders, the union contract provision is one advocates had urged as a way to make the protections harder to undo without a legal fight. Powell said the Trump administration especially targeted climate researchers at the agency. Trump has called global warming a “hoax,” and during his first year in office, his political appointees barred three EPA scientists from speaking about climate change at a conference in Rhode Island. Mandy Gunasekara, who served as EPA chief of staff under Trump, rejected allegations that his administration tried to suppress climate science. She said this research is likely to continue regardless of who’s in the White House. “Climate change will continue to be an important issue in a future conservative administration, but it’s not going to be the most important issue so that it displaces the agency fulfilling its full mission,” said Gunasekara, who wrote the chapter on the EPA in “Project 2025.” There are nonetheless heavy anxieties within the EPA over the Project 2025 proposals, said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, a former EPA official who advised agency leaders this week at a regularly scheduled meeting on the transition to the next administration. She said she reminded them that proposals to cut staff, for example, would require the cooperation of Congress. “A lot of things on the wish list can’t happen that easily,” said Orme-Zavaleta, who serves on the board of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees that works to support the agency and its mission. EPA spokesman Remmington Belford said in an email that the agency is “pleased” with the contract provision and “committed to ensuring the agency has a strong foundation of science that is free from political interference and inappropriate influence.” While helpful, the provision won’t be a panacea, said Tim Whitehouse, the executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a nonprofit advocacy group, which helped advise AFGE on the scientific integrity language. “It will be impossible to fully Trump-proof any agency or protect any scientist if Trump wins a new term and either the House or Senate is in Republican control,” Whitehouse said. “Then there will be absolutely no meaningful oversight.” The Interior Department — which manages vast swaths of public land and federal waters and oversees everything from offshore oil drilling to endangered species protections — could come under intense scrutiny in a second Trump administration. In the interview with “Fox & Friends,” Trump was asked about government programs that he would slash in a second term. “We’re going to do, like, Department of Interior,” he said in response. It remains unclear whether Trump wants to eliminate the Interior Department or merely reduce its budget and staffing levels. Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s 2024 campaign, did not directly respond to a request for clarification. Trump “cut red tape and gave the [oil and gas] industry more freedom to do what they do best — utilize the liquid gold under our feet to produce clean energy for America and the world — and he will do that again as soon as he gets back to the White House,” Leavitt said in an emailed statement. Career employees exited the Interior Department in droves during Trump’s four years in office. At the end of his presidency, there were 4,900 fewer employees at the agency than at the beginning, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management. The exodus was especially large at Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, which oversees roughly 245 million acres of public lands. After Trump briefly moved the BLM’s headquarters from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., more than 87 percent of the affected employees either resigned or retired. William Perry Pendley, who served as acting BLM director under Trump, defended the relocation, saying the vast majority of public lands are in the West. “If you want to be involved with the stakeholders — the governors, the county commissioners, the local people — then you’ve got to be out West,” Pendley said, adding that Biden administration officials in Washington are “badly out of touch.” In addition to the BLM move, in July 2017, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reassigned dozens of top career officials as part of a broader reorganization of the department. Joel Clement, a scientist and policy expert, was removed from his role as director of Interior’s Office of Policy Analysis and reassigned to an accounting position for which he had no experience. In a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel — and in an opinion piece in The Washington Post — Clement accused Zinke of illegally trying to force career staffers to quit. “That incident was a case study in them going after the people who do the science,” Clement, who now works at a philanthropic foundation, said in an interview. Ultimately, Interior’s internal watchdog found no written communications from Zinke that supported the allegation. In April, the Office of Personnel Management finalized a rule that will allow federal employees to keep their existing job protections and right to due process, including the right to appeal a reassignment or firing. The rule overturns a Trump directive, known as Schedule F, that allowed his administration to force out thousands of career employees by changing their status to at-will workers who could be fired without due process. NOAA leaders and observers said the agency is better equipped to withstand the sort of pressure scientists faced when Hurricane Dorian was approaching the U.S. coast in 2019, and Trump used a marker to extend the hurricane forecast cone to include Alabama. His warning prompted a quick clarification from NOAA forecasters that Alabama was not, in fact, in the likely path of the storm, and then a statement from agency leaders reaffirming Trump’s incorrect assertion. An investigation found undue political influence led to the release of that statement, violating NOAA’s scientific integrity policy. The agency has since updated that research policy — in January 2021 and again this March, said Cynthia Decker, NOAA’s scientific integrity officer. The policy includes guidelines on how scientists should conduct themselves, and asks them to articulate their findings openly and clearly to the public. It establishes that “credible allegations of fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, and interference with or undue influence on accurate public reporting of science” can result in “personnel actions” and even referral to the inspector general’s office. An extension of those policies to cover the Commerce Department is expected in the coming months, Decker said. It would include a mechanism by which even political appointees could be subject to allegations that they violated the integrity policy, something that could lead to a review or investigation and potential discipline, Decker said. These updates are important because they set “that moral and intellectual compass to remind people where the curbs are in the road,” said Craig McLean, a 40-year veteran of NOAA who served as the agency’s acting chief scientist during the Trump administration. But as strong as the policies may be, they aren’t permanent, some critics note. Legislation introduced in the two most recent sessions of Congress would have codified a requirement that federal agencies adopt scientific integrity policies and could establish legal penalties for violating them. With such a law in place, “the next president can’t say, ‘No, I don’t care,’” when violations of scientific integrity arise, said Andrew Rosenberg, a former NOAA official and a senior adviser at the Center for Ocean Leadership at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Daniel Weiner, director of the elections and government program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said government scientists will inevitably face pressures from on high. “There are always going to be political concerns pushing back on the science,” Weiner said. “I would expect that regardless of who wins the election.”"
94,Anna Phillips,Why this small state is picking a fight with Big Oil,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/06/14/vermont-climate-superfund-law-oil-companies/,Vermont has enacted the first state law requiring fossil fuel firms to pay for damages caused by climate change. Will it survive a near-certain legal challenge?,2024-06-14T10:00:00Z,"Nearly a year after catastrophic flooding struck Vermont, the city of Barre confronts the overwhelming task of steeling itself for the next climate disaster. Two bridges need to be raised. Barre’s north end “literally needs to be rebuilt,” said Mayor Thom Lauzon, who was recently elected and now oversees the city’s recovery. Of the 300 properties damaged by the flooding, many are still in various states of disrepair, and at least 50 are uninhabitable. Across the country, state and local leaders are scrambling to find the money they need to protect their communities from worsening disasters fueled by climate change. For Barre, needed flood mitigation projects will cost the city an estimated $30 million over the next five years, Lauzon said. Yet Vermont has a new answer to this problem. Earlier this month, it became the nation’s first state to require fossil fuel companies and other big emitters to pay for the climate-related damage their pollution has already caused statewide. While conservative legal experts are skeptical the law will survive challenges, some Vermonters said they are both grateful and a little nervous that one of the nation’s least populous states has picked a fight with one of America’s most powerful industries. “I’m proud to have this state stand up and say, ‘Look, you need to be held accountable, and you need to help us with the damage we incurred,’” Lauzon said. “But I’m also scared to death. I feel like we’re a pee wee football team going up against the 2020 New England Patriots.” The Vermont law comes as oil and gas companies face dozens of climate lawsuits, both in the United States and abroad. While none of the state and local lawsuits have gone to trial yet — including Vermont’s own challenge, filed in 2021 — they pose a growing threat and add to the companies’ potential liabilities. If Vermont’s novel approach endures, it could reverberate across the industry. Republicans are pushing back, arguing that individual states cannot apply their own laws to a global pollutant. Last month, Republican attorneys general in 19 states asked the Supreme Court to block the climate change lawsuits brought by California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island against fossil fuel companies. Vermont’s law authorizes the state to charge major polluters a fee for the share of greenhouse gas emissions they produced between 1995 and 2024. It is modeled on the 1980 federal Superfund law, which forces polluting companies to clean up toxic waste sites. The law doesn’t spell out how much money should be paid; instead, it tasks the state treasurer with assessing the damage Vermont has suffered from climate change and what it will cost to prepare for future impacts. The final tally is expected to be comprehensive, factoring in an array of possible costs from rebuilding and raising bridges and roads to lower worker productivity from rising heat. Bills similar to Vermont’s have been introduced in several states, including California, Maryland and Massachusetts. Last week, New York lawmakers passed a climate superfund law that would require polluters to pay $3 billion a year for 25 years. It is now awaiting Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature. The timing of the Vermont law was no accident, said Ben Edgerly Walsh, the climate and energy program director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group. Memories of last July’s flooding — which inundated the state capitol of Montpelier, damaged thousands of homes and trapped people in small mountain towns — are still fresh. Over the last year, Vermonters have also endured a freak late-spring frost that damaged crops, hazy skies from smoke blown south from hundreds of wildfires in Canada, and more flooding in mid-December. All these events primed state lawmakers to tackle climate change at the beginning of 2024. “When we brought this idea to legislators, they came to it with a very open mind in a way that may have taken more time, more convincing, in another year,” Edgerly Walsh said. “But this was a moment we just knew we needed to act.” As disaster recovery costs mount, it has not been lost on state leaders that oil companies are enjoying massive profits. In 2023, the warmest year on record, the two largest U.S. energy companies, ExxonMobil and Chevron, together made more than $57 billion. It might seem unlikely for a state like Vermont, with a population just under 650,000, to stand up to the fossil fuel industry. The state’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, expressed skepticism in a letter to the secretary of the Vermont Senate, writing, “Taking on ‘Big Oil’ should not be taken lightly. And with just $600,000 appropriated by the Legislature to complete an analysis that will need to withstand intense legal scrutiny from a well-funded defense, we are not positioning ourselves for success.” Yet Vermont’s small budget — it has the lowest GDP in the country — means that it feels the rising risks from heavy rains more acutely than wealthier states. A report by Rebuild by Design, a nonprofit that helps communities recover from disasters, found that Vermont ranked fifth nationally in per capita disaster relief costs from 2011-2021, with $593 spent per resident. The costs are only expected to climb. A 2022 study from University of Vermont researchers predicted that the cost of property damage from flooding alone may top $5.2 billion over the next 100 years. Ultimately, the governor allowed the law to go into effect without his signature, saying he understood “the desire to seek funding to mitigate the effects of climate change that has hurt our state in so many ways.” Legal challenges will inevitably follow — the only question is when. The oil and gas industry’s top lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute, has said that states don’t have the power to regulate carbon pollution and can’t retroactively charge companies for emissions allowed under the law. It has also emphasized individuals’ responsibility for climate change, noting that Vermont residents use fossil fuels to heat their homes and power their cars. Scott Lauermann, a spokesman for the group, said API is “considering all our options to reverse this punitive new fee.” “I think the courts are going to have problems with the idea that Vermont can penalize the companies for past actions that were completely legal and the state itself relies on,” said Jeff Holmstead, an energy lawyer who served in the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bush. “I’m skeptical this will actually pass muster.” Supporters and environmentalists involved in drafting the law said they believed they had created a legally defensible way to recover damages from polluters by modeling it after the Superfund law, which has been repeatedly upheld in court. Several legal experts said the state had also taken a more conservative approach than others by requiring a study before assessing companies’ liability, ensuring the fines levied against them are proportional to the amount of damage caused by their products. Cara Horowitz, executive director of the UCLA School of Law’s Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said that, inevitably, fossil fuel companies will challenge any bills Vermont submits for damages. But that is years off, she said, and the industry is likely to move sooner than that. The lawsuits “will start soon and last a long time,” Horowitz said. “It would surprise me if they don’t preemptively try to undermine the entire exercise by declaring the whole thing unlawful.” In Barre, Lauzon said he isn’t confident litigation over the law will be resolved in his lifetime. But even if the fossil fuel companies are never made to pay, he said, the law’s passage was the right thing to do. “I can’t look at the north end, I can’t look at the city of Barre and say no one needs to be held accountable,” he said."
95,"Sarah Ellison, Elahe Izadi",Post publisher draws more scrutiny after newsroom shake-up,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/06/06/post-publisher-draws-more-scrutiny-after-newsroom-shakeup/,Washington Post Publisher and CEO William Lewis is drawing scrutiny after press reports described him as attempting to dissuade journalists — including those at The Post — from covering his involvemen,2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Washington Post Publisher and CEO William Lewis is drawing scrutiny after press reports described him as attempting to dissuade journalists — including those at The Post — from covering his involvement in a long-running British phone-hacking lawsuit. The accounts emerged following the abrupt resignation of The Post’s executive editor, Sally Buzbee, who, after three years in the job, stepped down Sunday without public explanation, and Lewis’s announcement of a major restructuring of the newsroom. Reports about his involvement with news coverage at The Post — which Lewis denied — sparked concern for the appearance of violating traditional firewalls that keep corporate media bosses from influencing decisions made by news editors. On Wednesday, the New York Times first reported a tense meeting in May between Lewis and Buzbee related to The Post’s plans for a story about a long-running civil case brought by Prince Harry and others regarding a phone-hacking scheme at some of Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids, where Lewis once worked. The Post has confirmed that account with two people familiar with the meeting, which Buzbee described at the time to multiple people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive conversation. Lewis told Buzbee that the story — about a judge’s decision whether to include Murdoch executives, including Lewis, in the case as individuals accused of covering up evidence — did not warrant coverage and that publishing it represented a lapse in judgment, these people said. The Post published its story, but Buzbee was concerned about the tenor of their exchange. Buzbee had a similar exchange with Lewis in March over a previous story about the case, another person said. In an email to a Post reporter Thursday afternoon, Lewis called the account “inaccurate” and said that he “did not pressure her in any way.” He acknowledged Buzbee had informed him of plans to publish a story but that he was “professional throughout.” He also said he doesn’t recall ever having used the phrase “serious lapse in judgment.” He described a process, which he said was common, of asking about a story and offering thoughts or input “if appropriate,” and  making clear that the decision to publish ultimately rested with the editor. “I know how this works, I know the right thing to do, and what not to do. I know where the lines are, and I respect them,” he wrote, adding: “The Executive Editor is free to publish when, how, and what they want to. I am fully signed up to that.” Buzbee declined to comment on Lewis’s description of their meetings. The other press account came from NPR media reporter David Folkenflik, who published a story Thursday describing his experience with Lewis: After being named The Post’s next publisher, but before his first day on the job, Lewis “repeatedly — and heatedly” offered to give Folkenflik an exclusive interview about The Post’s future, in exchange for him dropping a story about new court documents in the phone-hacking case. He refused. In his email to The Post, Lewis called Folkenflik — who published a book in 2013 on Rupert Murdoch’s media empire — “an activist, not a journalist.” Lewis added: “I had an off the record conversation with him before I joined you at The Post and some six months later he has dusted it down, and made up some excuse to make a story of a non-story.” Folkenflik told The Post late Thursday their off-the-record agreement related to the substance of the hacking case and the story he was reporting, but not “his efforts to induce me to kill my story.” He added that Lewis and a London-based press aide “subsequently confirmed” the nature of the offer in exchanges “that were not placed off the record.” Folkenflik noted that Lewis did not deny the offers. As for Lewis’s description of him as an “activist,” Folkenflik noted that “The Post itself and the New York Times do find my stories newsworthy.” Many in The Post newsroom found the accounts dismaying. A publisher and CEO oversees the entirety of a newspaper but traditionally does not direct or oversee decisions about what to report. It is considered a third rail in journalism for business-side leaders to intervene or attempt to influence coverage in their own publications, particularly when it concerns them and their own interests, said Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “The firewall exists to protect the credibility of the news coverage,” she said. “It’s there so people can’t peddle influence that ultimately keeps important information from readers or viewers.” Sometimes publishers and CEOs are consulted or notified about sensitive reporting — such as Katharine Graham’s involvement in The Post’s reporting on the Pentagon Papers. But Culver said “we should not be shifting coverage of ourselves.” Lewis joined Murdoch’s U.K. publishing operation in September 2010, after the phone-hacking scandal had come to light. The following year, he was appointed to a committee created to oversee the corporate response to the scandal, including liaising with the police and with parliamentary inquiries. Ongoing litigation alleges that some of Murdoch’s executives, including Lewis, were involved in concealing evidence in the case from police. Lewis downplayed his involvement in the phone-hacking cleanup in an interview with a Post reporter last year, saying he held a junior role and that his task was ensuring journalistic practices were honored during the investigation, such as protecting sources. He said “the opposite is true” of criticisms by some News Corp journalists that he handed over journalists’ information. “I did whatever I could to preserve our journalistic integrity,” he said. He later added: “I took a view very early on that I’m never going to talk about it. And it’s either right or wrong that I’ve done that.” Lewis became the top executive at The Post in January to oversee the company at a tumultuous time. The Post has endured staff reductions, declining subscriptions and a $77 million loss over the last year. He embarked on an effort to turn The Post’s financial fortunes around and, on Sunday evening, announced a major reorganization, including new subscription tiers and the creation of a separate newsroom unit focused on social media-driven and service journalism aimed at untapped audiences. Lewis also announced that former Wall Street Journal top editor Matt Murray would replace Buzbee in overseeing the newsroom, and after the presidential election, former deputy Telegraph editor Robert Winnett will oversee the core news report. Murray will then take over the new unit. Both Murray and Winnett have previously worked for Lewis. After the first press accounts of Lewis’s interactions with journalists over the phone-hacking case emerged, Murray affirmed that Post reporters should cover the matter. “I’m very confident The Post will cover whatever we have to cover as a story independently, objectively and fairly,” he told editors in a meeting Thursday morning. Lewis has been known to take questions from staffers in informal settings and all-staff meetings. On Monday, he fielded several about the lack of diversity atop the company and the future he saw for The Post. At times, the exchanges turned contentious. He declined to offer any specifics about Buzbee’s departure. The Post reported Monday that Lewis had offered Buzbee oversight of the new division of The Post’s newsroom — a position she declined — and that Buzbee had attempted to persuade Lewis to hold off on his reorganization until after the election. On Wednesday, when a reporter approached him to follow up on scheduling an interview, he expressed his disapproval with The Post’s recent reporting on its own leadership changes. When asked Thursday via email to identify inaccuracies in the piece, he replied: “Forgive me, there has been a lot written by various people. You may well have captured this accurately.” He went on to say that he had offered Buzbee a new editorial division, that she considered the offer and helped to make plans for the restructuring, but then she changed her mind and stepped down. “I was sorry to lose her, wish we could have worked longer together, but it was not to be,” Lewis added. Lewis has described his role as publisher as a defender of journalism. In his first meeting with staffers in November, he cited former Post publisher Don Graham’s advice: that publishers should support editors and be in constant communication, because “there should never be any surprises.” “I will never cross the line,” he added. “These are the editors. I am the publisher. There’s a very clear line there, which will be maintained at all times.”"
96,Jennifer Rubin,We get more clarity on the Israel-Hamas war,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/14/trump-democracy-gaza-newsletter/,You cannot be pro-America and pro-Trump.,2024-06-14T13:00:41Z,"You’re reading Jennifer Rubin’s subscriber-only newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox.  This week, I look at recent events that help make sense of the Israel-Hamas war, pick the distinguished person of the week and share one of my favorite literary genres. Several new incidents should sharpen the public’s understanding of the war in Gaza — if the public cares to pay attention. President Biden put forth a cease-fire plan. Israel accepted. Hamas did not. As national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it on ABC’s “This Week”: “If Hamas came and said yes to the deal on the table, there would be an end to the need for these kinds of operations, because the hostages would be coming out peacefully and not through military actions.” He reiterated on “Face the Nation”: “By far the most effective, certain and right way to get all of the hostages out is to get a comprehensive cease-fire and hostage deal that President Biden described in public a few days ago, that Israel has accepted, and now that we are awaiting Hamas to respond to.” The United Nations Security Council voted 14-0 in favor of it. Calls for a cease-fire should be directed at Hamas, not Biden or Israel. Moreover, one party is deliberately raising the civilian death toll: Hamas. “Yahya Sinwar has resisted pressure to cut a ceasefire-and-hostages deal with Israel. Behind his decision, messages the Hamas military leader in Gaza has sent to mediators show, is a calculation that more fighting — and more Palestinian civilian deaths — work to his advantage,” the Wall Street Journal reports. That’s right: The goal is civilian deaths. “Sinwar in a message urged his comrades in Hamas’s political leadership outside Gaza not to make concessions and instead to push for a permanent end to the war. High civilian casualties would create worldwide pressure on Israel, Sinwar said.” Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces’ daring operation that rescued four Israeli hostages held for more than eight months provided new context for the war. The hostages were rescued from ostensibly civilian apartment buildings. The Times of Israel reported, “At 11:00 a.m. the order was given to the Yamam and Shin Bet officers to raid two multistory buildings in Nuseirat, where Hamas was holding the hostages.” The report continued, “[Noa] Argamani was held by Hamas guards alone in the home of a Palestinian family, while the other three hostages were held at a separate home, also with guards. According to the IDF, Hamas pays such families to hold the hostages in their houses.” (Reports that one hostage was held in the home of an Al Jazeera journalist were “stridently denied” by the Qatari news network.) Civilians were killed during the raid, but the U.S. government has yet to confirm the number, nor do we know whether the dead included the hostage takers and minders. The hostages’ location requires some rethinking of how we assess Israel’s conduct of the war and how to count and classify casualties. Hamas committed war crimes on Oct.7 by killing, raping and abducting civilians. It has continued to commit war crimes by holding civilians hostage and, again, by treating them inhumanely. And in making military targets of civilian homes by turning them into hostage cells, Hamas has again committed war crimes. Any civilian death is regrettable, but in this scenario, Hamas is solely responsible for the casualties resulting from the rescue mission. The rescue certainly raises troubling questions about the degree to which civilians are aiding and abetting terrorists (either voluntarily or by force). To the extent civilians become participants — including hostage-holding — they lose the protection of international law. In evaluating whether Israeli’s actions comply with international law and in counting civilian casualties, we therefore must know whether and to what degree they have became combatants and adjuncts to the terrorists. Until we do, the civilian casualty figures are uninformative. Finally, many news reports labeled a protest outside the White House last weekend as “pro-Palestinian” or “pro-Gaza.” Really? It included explicit tributes to Hamas and unabashed antisemitic messages. NBC News reported: Social media posts showed demonstrators chanting, “Hezbollah, Hezbollah, kill another Zionist now.” Video circulated of marchers bearing a banner that read: “Jihad of Victory or Martyrdom.” Where is the condemnation from those claiming to pursue human rights for all and who deny antisemitic motivations? The bottom line: Israel has to answer for any noncompliance with international law and inadequate measures to shield civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid. However, lost in the shrieking at Biden and Israel is a recognition that Hamas sparked the war with a brutal attack, is responsible for civilians killed during the hostage rescue, and has committed a grave legal and moral wrong in erasing the line between civilians and combatants. Hamas wants more civilians to die. It’s incumbent on Israel’s harshest critics to dissociate themselves from Hamas enablers and antisemites. If not, they have no claim to the moral high ground. Retired federal judge David S. Tatel’s “Vision: A Memoir of Blindness and Justice,” recounts his work as a civil rights lawyer and his 30 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as well as his challenges coping with blindness. The book has received added attention for its straight talk about the Supreme Court. The Post reports that Tatel castigates the Supreme Court for “chipping away at past precedent, most notably overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 and restricting the use of race in college admissions last year.” (Tatel retired partially out of disgust for, in his words, “a Supreme Court that seemed to hold in such low regard the principles to which I’ve dedicated my life.”) Tatel does not hold back. “It was one thing to follow rulings I believed were wrong when they resulted from a judicial process I respected,” he writes. “It was quite another to be bound by the decisions of an institution I barely recognized.” He also calls for term limits for justices. Our democracy cannot survive the collapse of the Supreme Court’s legitimacy if jurists and former jurists maintain a conspiracy of silence. Both retired and active judges need to be candid about the crisis at the Supreme Court. (Retired justice Stephen G. Breyer exhibited little candor in his memoir.) Jurists have the credibility to demand that the justices abide by mandatory ethics guidelines that bind all lower courts. State judges and retired judges can go further to urge the justices to cease their partisan harangues, respect precedent and refrain from cherry-picking history and misrepresenting facts. With approval of the Supreme Court stuck around an all-time low, Congress and the American people need to push for reform. But judges are uniquely able to elevate and guide the debate. Tatel provides a perfect role model. One of my favorite genres is historical fiction. If the author has done her homework, she can illuminate hidden corners of history and rescue important figures from obscurity. Here are a few recent finds: “The Berlin Letters: A Cold War Novel”: Katherine Reay weaves a fascinating tale of a family divided by the Berlin Wall as she explores the intellectual and moral trauma of living in an authoritarian regime. The characters are fictional, but the setting and divisions were all too real. “A Shadow in Moscow: A Cold War Novel”: Also from Reay, we get the story of two women and multiple generations involved in cat-and-mouse espionage, which often requires deceiving their own family. Spies’ personal betrayals and emotional isolation are as fascinating as the superpower politics. “March”: Geraldine Brooks’s “sequel” to “Little Women” imagines Mr. March’s Civil War experience. Brooks portrays in horrible detail the plantation system as well as the mental and physical costs of war. “Finding Margaret Fuller”: Allison Pataki traces the life of Fuller — a member of the Transcendentalists, a close confidante of Ralph Waldo Emerson and David Thoreau, a feminist, a glass-ceiling-breaking publisher, an author and a foreign journalist. If not for Fuller’s gender, she would be as well known as her male peers. “The Women”: Kristin Hannah portrays the harrowing experience of women nurses in Vietnam — and the emotional consequences the war had on women whose service was ignored or even denied. “A Death in Harlem”/“Gone Missing in Harlem”: Karla F.C. Holloway sets crime thrillers in the midst of the Harlem Renaissance while revealing the struggles of neighborhood’s first Black police officer. These are deft accounts of race and class. Every other Wednesday at noon, I host a Q&A with readers. Submit a question for the next one."
97,Jennifer Rubin,Trump is out for revenge,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/12/trump-trial-verdict-revenge/,Some in the media are taking his threats seriously for a change.,2024-06-12T16:00:39Z,"You’re reading Jennifer Rubin’s subscriber-only newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox.  This week I take some questions, point to an example of solid journalism and share an excerpt from a key legal opinion. A reader asks: Former president Donald Trump does not show remorse for the crimes for which he has been convicted. My understanding has been that a primary factor in sentencing is the degree of remorse (or, in this case, complete absence and denial). Why is that not mentioned more? Answer: It is certainly one factor, although defendants pursuing an appeal, as former judge Nancy Gertner recently pointed out in the New York Times, are not expected to sabotage their chances for a new trial by confessing and expressing remorse. That said, Trump’s contempt for the legal system, his ongoing threats and smears, and his record of inciting a mob to violence (on Jan. 6, 2021) all weigh in favor of some jail time. A reader asks: We know there are Republicans disenchanted by Trump who may not wish to vote for him in November. However, what alternative do they have? Surely most would avoid voting for President Biden. But if they want to vote their conservative values, Trump is the only apparent choice. What can well-meaning, anti-Trump conservatives do with their votes? Is not voting at all their only choice? Answer: Trump is no conservative. He holds views utterly contrary to conservative philosophy: arguing he can suspend the Constitution, itching to reward Vladimir Putin’s aggression and vowing to lock up opponents. If they love the Constitution and the rule of law, these Republicans have only one choice: President Biden. A reader asks: Can’t U.S. libel and slander laws be made forceful enough to punish those who falsely defame judges? Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom to say anything, especially if patently false. Answer: The problem is not the law. Judges do not want to sacrifice their own impartiality by suing a party or former party. They have other means of holding parties and lawyers accountable, including use of contempt and taking defendants’ threats and smears into consideration when it comes to sentencing. A reader asks: I thought Republicans supported anyone/everyone who wants a gun to have one: alcoholics, dementia patients, people who have restraining orders against them, people who have suicidal thoughts, people who make threats to elected leaders, etc. If that is the case, why is Hunter Biden being excoriated in court for what seems like a personal tragedy? He wanted to buy a gun, and he thought his addiction was under control. Sheesh. Answer: Moreover, given that such gun cases are virtually never prosecuted, here is a real case of selective prosecution! Do not expect anything but hypocrisy all the way down the line from the MAGA crowd. A reader asks: What are your views regarding the likelihood of the military [assisting] Trump in his dictatorial rule? This is a serious question. Answer: It is a serious issue. The military is imbued with deep respect for civilian leadership. That means it would likely follow ill-advised, misguided and outright foolish direction (e.g., removing troops from Europe). But it is also deeply steeped in reverence for democracy and the Constitution. For example, I do not think military leaders would follow orders to fire on fellow Americans. That we are even discussing this — and banking on the military to stop Trump, if need be — tells us he should not get anywhere near the Oval Office. A reader asks: Why doesn’t the Biden campaign run ads of Republicans, including Mitch McConnell and Lindsey  Graham, denouncing Trump on Jan. 6? How about ads of Trump’s unhinged speeches (with subtitles)? Or of Republicans such as William P. Barr declaring no indication of widespread fraud in 2020? And, most importantly, 24/7 ads about Trump and overturning Roe v. Wade? Can they run these type of ads nonstop on Fox News? Answer: The campaign is doing many of those things already and will do more. Keep in mind that many people are tuned out. Many watch very little TV, and Fox News viewers may not be the target audience. Much better to run ads during sporting events and popular daytime TV (e.g., “The View”). A reader asks: Wouldn’t it be appropriate for Hillary Clinton to attend [Trump’s] sentencing hearing and give a victim’s statement on behalf of herself and the American voters? I’ve heard legal pundits say that this crime has no tangible victims, and therefore it would be difficult to impose a maximum sentence. Isn’t the American electorate the victim who was deprived of the information needed to make an informed decision in 2016? Answer: The last thing we need is to make this about Hillary Clinton. It wouldn’t influence Justice Juan Merchan, but it would give credence to the lie that the trial is all about Democrats persecuting the MAGA leader. There could be no bigger contrast between presidential candidates with regard to the rule of law. Biden has not interfered with the Justice Department’s prosecution of his son. He has also avoided making accusations of selective prosecution and vowed not to pardon his son. Trump, meanwhile, threatened retribution for those who have investigated him (including locking up members of the House Jan. 6 select committee) and smeared the judge and jury in his New York trial. It’s impossible to ignore that we have one candidate who fulfills his oath and one who has shown he is entirely incapable of upholding his. This headline from the New York Times got it right: “Trump’s Vows to Prosecute Rivals Put Rule of Law on the Ballot.” Its subhead was equally insightful: “Donald Trump’s promise to seek retribution challenges long-established norms. The election could hinge in part on what kind of justice system the country believes it has now and wants in the future.” There are several things worth emphasis here: First, since many readers don’t go beyond the headline, it got the essential message right there. Second, the report took Trump literally and seriously, putting his threats in the context of our judicial system and democracy as a whole. The report did not treat it as a “clever strategy,” nor did it speculate as to whether it would “work.” Third, the piece quoted several legal experts, including a libertarian and a pro-Trump conservative to explain why personalized and politicized prosecution is dangerous. And, finally, the reporters did not feel compelled to give voice to MAGA voices’ false accusation that Biden had concocted the New York criminal trial. Kudos are in order for “explaining the stakes” and conveying Trump’s unprecedented campaign of vengeance. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, in another stunt to delay the Espionage Act trial against Trump, not only entertained a frivolous motion challenging the constitutionality of special counsel Jack Smith’s appointment but also invited three groups of amici curiae (or “friends of the court”) to file briefs and participate in oral arguments about the motion, a virtually unheard-of practice. Fortunately, constitutional scholar Matthew Seligman, on behalf of an esteemed group of former prosecutors, lawyers and scholars, filed one such brief opposing the absurd Trump motion. Seligman obliterates the argument challenging the special counsel: Seligman might as well have added that Cannon’s decision to entertain such an absurd motion — let alone invite outside attorneys to conduct what amounts to a debate — is further evidence she shouldn’t be on the case, a view shared by attorneys of all stripes, including Ty Cobb, who represented Trump during the Robert S. Mueller III investigation. Evidence grows with each of Cannon’s delays and laborious briefing exercises that she is either deliberately aiding Trump, incompetent or so anxious about trying the case that she has resorted to stalling (perhaps some combination of all of these). At some point, Smith should move to recuse Cannon, who blemishes the bench with each inane ruling. Next week I’ll have my online chat, so please submit your questions. Questions submitted after next Wednesday will go to my next mailbag newsletter."
98,Jennifer Rubin,The Hunter Biden and Trump trials were a litmus test. Only the Bidens passed.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/16/hunter-biden-donald-trump-convictions/,The president’s family rallied in support of one of their own. Trump family members were conspicuously absent.,2024-06-16T11:45:00Z,"No person with a loved one who has suffered through addiction could feel anything but empathy for Hunter Biden and his family. “There are a lot of Hunter Bidens in this world, people who fell in way over their heads, who long for someone to believe they can recover and construct their lives differently,” Patti Davis, a recovered addict and the daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, wrote last week in the New York Times. “You just don’t hear about them on the evening news.” The tragedy, pain and trauma of drug addiction is not lost on millions of Americans. And as Davis noted, “Some observers argue that if Hunter Biden were not the president’s son, he wouldn’t be on trial for buying a gun while being addicted to drugs, since he had the gun for only 11 days and it wasn’t used in any crime.” That a prosecutor appointed by felon and former president Donald Trump should bring a case of the type so rarely charged only heightened the queasy feeling that Hunter Biden was forced to bear the burden of being a president’s son. “As former president Donald Trump complains that he is a victim of selective prosecution for his brazen attempts to defy a federal subpoena, Hunter Biden may actually be experiencing it,” David Graham wrote for the Atlantic. Even a juror said the prosecution was a “waste” of tax dollars. The reaction of many MAGA types and their captive right-wing media — seemingly disappointed that the allegedly “rigged” judicial system apparently wasn’t so rigged after all — was one sign of the moral chasm and twisted logic that has come to define MAGA-era politics. On every score, the Biden family throughout the public ordeal exemplified dignity, decency and the sort of unconditional love that many endlessly needy narcissists and other damaged adults were denied as children. (One is reminded of Henry Kissinger’s dig at Richard M. Nixon: “Can you imagine what this man would have been like if somebody had loved him?”) First lady Jill Biden regularly attended her son’s trial; President Biden never impugned the judicial system. Biden promised not to pardon his son or commute his sentence, and embraced him after the trial. In a written statement, the president said: “Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.” He added, “I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.” Trump, convicted of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to an adult-film actress in an effort to block the story from appearing before the 2016 election, alternately fumed and slept his way through his trial. His wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner never showed up to demonstrate support. Only his son Eric was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. During and after Trump’s trial, he and his MAGA minions attacked the judicial system, smeared the judge and jury, and then refused to accept the legitimacy of the verdict. Trump’s bizarre call to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) demanding that “we have to overturn this” epitomized not just his constitutional ignorance but the MAGA movement’s determination to burn down a judicial system that could not be corrupted to do his bidding. At its worst, cynical political coverage and punditry about the two criminal trials often regurgitated MAGA spin that Trump’s conviction could help him. Hunter Biden’s case was frequently portrayed as a potential election-year “problem” or “trouble” for the president. (While some polls show Biden has improved by a couple of points, Trump has not benefited from either trial.) The New York Times even appeared to question President Biden’s judgment for inviting Hunter to the White House. The Biden family in these past few weeks have demonstrated qualities such as respect, empathy and decency that have long defined “public virtue.” (Even the term seems quaint these days.) For a time, Republicans insisted that presidents needed to embody those characteristics. No more. Now the MAGA Republicans and their warped cult leader celebrate cruelty, vindictiveness and lust for power. This gaping moral divide has been nowhere more evident than in the candidates’ (and their followers’) conduct and rhetoric during these two trials. Now the question has been sharpened: Which candidate should we emulate — and what sort of country do we want to live in?"
99,Jennifer Rubin,"For presidents, it’s not age but judgment that matters",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/09/wall-street-journal-biden-slipping-article/,A derided Wall Street Journal article about Biden “slipping” warrants a reset of 2024 coverage.,2024-06-09T11:45:00Z,"The widespread media condemnation of a shoddy front-page Wall Street Journal article about President Biden “slipping” with age suggests we may have reached a journalistic inflection point. The Journal article relied almost entirely on the views of two highly partisan Republicans to support its Biden-is-slipping thesis: House Speaker Mike Johnson and former speaker Kevin McCarthy. Maybe the overwhelmingly negative response by other journalists to what was essentially the promotion of a right-wing meme will reduce such irresponsible reporting as the election year continues. The issue, certainly, goes beyond being influenced by MAGA narratives or failing to adequately examine the mental and emotional state of felon and former president Donald Trump. (But, given Trump’s innumerable unhinged rants, it just might be time to rethink whether a candidate’s psychiatric state is journalistically out of bounds.) Rather, the Journal’s faceplant should lead to a much larger discussion: to what extent and in what way age matters to the performance of the chief executive. Frankly, it has nothing to do with the sort of factors Biden’s critics obsess over (e.g., verbal slips, how fast he moves). Political journalists tend to deal heavily in the realm of politicians’ quips and comebacks, as well as horse-race politics and presidential “visuals.” They naturally then come to think of a president — with whom they interact in debates, news conferences and interviews — as a media performer. Does he misspeak? Does he physically stumble? Focusing on such relatively superficial subjects has come to define political journalism. But let’s stop for a moment. A president’s gait, verbal tics and minor recall errors have virtually nothing to do with the job of being president. The White House occupant is not a “Jeopardy!” contestant, a stand-up comic, a talk-show host or guest; the president is the head of the executive branch and commander in chief. The job of being president is executive management, something with which political reporters (as opposed to business reporters) have virtually no expertise. We should be asking whether a candidate can absorb necessary details, make good personnel decisions, reach sound conclusions, evaluate risk and consider the consequences of actions. Can the president separate personal interests from the interests of the nation, of allies or even the planet? That is what the president does, day after day. And we do not need to be armchair psychiatrists to evaluate that sort of presidential fitness. As I have written, Trump’s closest colleagues tell us that he is willfully ignorant, cannot grasp basic concepts, cannot absorb written material. As for his hiring decisions, by his own admission, he has hired a slew of dumb or incompetent people. He gloms on to ridiculous quack theories, and he channels the ideas and rhetoric of America’s enemies and of historical villains. Trump cannot keep national secrets — or understand they are not “his.” He is incapable of grasping the values and ethos of military service. Because he is so susceptible to flattery and so thin-skinned, he cannot tell friend from foe. And as his former national security adviser John Bolton put it, “Trump really cares only about retribution for himself, and it will consume much of a second term.” Part and parcel of good decision-making is impulse control. If one cannot refrain from lashing out in anger at allies, spilling secrets to U.S. enemies, or launching personal attacks and threats against fellow Americans (in defiance of court orders, no less), one cannot be entrusted with the immense responsibilities of the presidency. (There might also be something seriously wrong with you, but that is beside the point.) Moreover, we know how Trump’s decision-making turned out. He downplayed the coronavirus, and hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily. He concocted the “big lie” about the 2020 election and, unable to admit losing, incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol. He didn’t want to reveal embarrassing sexual impropriety, so he broke the law in New York — 34 times. You don’t need to make a specific medical diagnosis to see that the essential aspects of the presidency — judgment, reading comprehension, discretion, unselfish decision-making, appreciation for military sacrifice — are utterly beyond Trump. At the most basic level, Biden, while three years older, can discern friend from foe, reveres the military, understands the value of alliances, generally hires capable advisers, puts together complex legislative deals and exhibits inexhaustible empathy for others’ suffering. He complies with the legal process (e.g., sitting down with special counsel Robert K. Hur), follows Supreme Court decisions (and then explores alternatives, as he did on student debt) and engages in successful international diplomacy. He talks in depth about policy. It’s reasonable to conclude that, with age, Biden has gained immense experience, formed relationships and absorbed data that helps guide his current decision-making. Should we care that he walks more stiffly than he did 10 years ago? (FDR served 12 years in a wheelchair.) In sum, the measure of a president — regardless of that officeholder’s level of spryness or eloquence — is the capacity to perform a singularly important job: making good decisions on behalf of others in keeping with our laws and national values. No reasonable person would conclude, based on all available evidence, that Trump can do so; no fair person would conclude that Biden’s age impedes him from doing so."
