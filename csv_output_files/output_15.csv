The U.S., which is co-hosting the tournament with the West Indies, were given just a 7% chance of winning by some bookmakers before the match. But the U.S. team, which is competing in its first T20 World Cup, pulled off what has been described as one of the biggest shocks in cricket history and now look to have a good shot at qualifying for the next round, the Super 8 stage. Meanwhile Pakistan, champions in 2009 and runners-up in 2022, are at risk of an early exit from the tournament. “I am really proud of the boys,” Monank Patel, the U.S. captain and player of the game, said after the win, which was achieved in a tie-breaking Super Over after the scores were level after 20 overs. “It was a complete team effort from ball one to the last ball.” Aatif Nawaz, a British-Pakistani comedian and cricket commentator, took to X to express his surprise at the U.S. triumph. “Genuinely never thought I’d ever see that fixture, never mind that result,” he said. USA have just beaten Pakistan in a game of T20 Cricket at the World Cup. Genuinely never thought I'd ever see that fixture, never mind that result. One of the biggest upsets, if not the biggest upset, in cricket history. Wow. #T20WorldCup Waqar Younis, a former player and coach of Pakistan’s national team, congratulated the U.S. for its “thumping victory,” adding that “Pakistan looked exhausted and helpless in the field.” Americans, many acknowledging that they’re just now tuning into cricket, which doesn’t even break into the country’s top 20 favorite sports, celebrated the upset on social media. “Like six people total in this entire country know how to play cricket and they just beat Pakistan,” one X user posted. “Cricket twitter tried to beef with us so we decided to take over the sport within a few days LMAOOOOO,” another added. Been a Cricket fan for a clean 20 minutes and all I gotta say isUSAUSAUSA🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/75yGSuCD9N Many marveled at the fact that U.S. star player Saurabh Netravalkar apparently has a day job as a software engineer. USA beating Pakistan in cricket is literally the plumbers beating Wilt Chamberlain.Our best player is not a professional cricketer but software engineer at Oracle.It’s the biggest upset since 1776 and honestly, George Washington had better odds. @FanDuel can confirm. But the T20 World Cup is hardly over, and the U.S. will have at least one more chance to defy expectations. Both Pakistan and the U.S. face No. 1-ranked India in their next matches in New York on Sunday and Wednesday, respectively."
1,Associated Press,Chunk of Teton Pass Road Collapses; Unclear How Quickly It Can Be Rebuilt,https://time.com/6986968/chunk-of-teton-pass-road-collapses/,"It was not immediately clear how long it will take to reopen the road, a vital artery for people who live in both Wyoming and in Idaho.",2024-06-09T14:35:45Z,"Jackson, Wyo. — A large chunk of a twisting mountain pass road collapsed in Wyoming, authorities said Saturday, leaving a gaping chasm in the highway and severing a well-traveled commuter link between small towns in eastern Idaho and the tourist destination of Jackson. Aerial photos and drone video of the collapse show the Teton Pass road riven with deep cracks, and a big section of the pavement disappeared altogether. Part of the guardrail dangled into the void, and orange traffic drums marked off the danger area. The road was closed at the time of the collapse. The section that failed first drew attention Thursday when a crack and drop in the road contributed to the crash of a motorcycle. Geologists and engineers who were sent to the area that day noticed “that crack and that drop started to move a lot,” said Stephanie Harsha, a spokesperson for District 3 of the Wyoming Department of Transportation. A paving crew temporarily patched the road, and traffic began moving again that night. But that was short-lived as maintenance crews were sent to respond to a mudslide a couple of miles away in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, prompting the road to be closed once again. Crews then noticed that the damage to the pavement had become more pronounced. Workers trying to figure out a detour around that section left for the night, “and by 5 a.m., this morning, WYDOT had discovered that the road had completely failed,” Harsha said Saturday. “We were very, very lucky that no crews were harmed. No equipment was damaged,” she said. “So now, engineers and geologists are doing geological assessments on the pass. They’ve been looking at it all day.” The transportation department said via social media that the road “catastrophically failed” at milepost 12.8. It was not immediately clear how long it will take to reopen the road, a vital artery for people who live across the border in Idaho and work in pricey Jackson, which is also close to the popular Grand Teton National Park. Harsha said an alternate route between Jackson and the area of Victor, Idaho, goes more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) out of the way and adds “quite a bit to any commute.” Gov. Mark Gordon signed an executive order declaring an emergency, which his office said would help the state access additional resources from the Federal Highway Administration to begin repair work. In a statement, the governor said the transportation department is working on “a long-term solution to rebuild this critical roadway.” “I recognize the significant impacts this closure has to Teton County residents, regional commuters and the local economy,” Gordon said."
2,JONATHAN J. COOPER / AP,Trump Campaign Has Extra Medics and Water for Las Vegas Rally in Scorching Heat,https://time.com/6986987/trump-campaign-medics-water-las-vegas-rally-scorching-heat/,"Donald Trump's campaign is hiring extra medics, loading up on fans and water bottles and allowing supporters to carry umbrellas.",2024-06-09T16:57:01Z,"LAS VEGAS — Former President Donald Trump rallied voters in the scorching heat of Las Vegas, at points telling his supporters to ask for help if needed and appearing irritable with the teleprompters that he said were not working. The presumptive GOP nominee’s campaign hired extra medics, loading up on fans and water bottles and allowed supporters to carry umbrellas to an outdoor rally Sunday in Las Vegas, where temperatures exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius). “I don’t want anybody going on me. We need every voter. I don’t care about you. I just want your vote,” he said, adding that he was joking. Read More: Trump Voters Live in a Different Reality Earlier in his speech, he said the campaign would offer help to people who were feeling tired and joked that “everybody,” including the U.S. Secret Service, was worried about the safety of the crowds and not about him. “They never mentioned me. I’m up here sweating like a dog,” he said. “This is hard work.” Trump returned to Nevada, one of the top battleground states in the November election, for his second rally since he was found guilty in a hush-money scandal. Read More: How Trump's Life Will Change Now That He’s a Convicted Felon The unprecedented conviction of a former president has juiced Trump’s fundraising and galvanized his supporters, but it remains to be seen whether it will sway swing voters. Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by New York probation officials via a video conference Monday, a required step before his July sentencing. Temperatures in the Southwest have cooled since reaching historic highs late last week but remain above normal for this time of year and topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) at the rally, which took place at a park with little shade next to the airport. Read More: How to Protect Yourself During a Sweltering Heat Wave Well into his speech, Trump said it was “not as bad” as he thought it would be, and said he was angrier with the teleprompters not working well, even when he used to mock President Barack Obama for relying on that device. “I pay all this money to teleprompter people, and I’d say 20% of the time, they don’t work,” he said, adding he would not pay the vendor who provided the prompters. “It’s a mess.” Campaign organizers handed out water bottles as supporters waited in line to be screened by security officers. Inside the venue, large misting fans, pallets of water and cooling tents were placed around the perimeter. Clouds moved in and a breeze picked up about two hours before Trump was scheduled to take the stage, bringing a semblance of relief from the oppressive sun. “This is a dry heat. This ain’t nothing for Las Vegas people,” Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald said. “But what it symbolizes for the rest of the United States—we will walk through hell” to elect Donald Trump. McDonald and five other Republicans have been accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of Nevada’s 2020 presidential election and their trial has been pushed to next year. Trump said the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 were “victims” of a “set up.” “They were really, more than anything else, they are victims of what happened. All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That’s what they were doing. And then the police say, go in, go in, go in, go in,” he said. “What a set up that was. A horrible, horrible thing.” The conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 rioters were encouraged by law enforcement is widespread on the right but has no basis in fact. Many of those who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said—proudly, publicly, repeatedly—that they did so to help the then-president. Federal and state election officials and Trump’s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the 2020 election was tainted. The former president’s allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed. The campaign paid for additional EMS services to be on site in the case of emergency. The Secret Service made an exception to allow people to bring in personal water bottles and umbrellas. Food trucks sold shaved ice and oversized cups of lemonade. “You know what? It’s worth it,” said Camille Lombardi, a 65-year-old retired nurse from Henderson in suburban Las Vegas who was seeing Trump in person for the first time. “Too bad it wasn’t indoors, but that’s OK.” During a Trump rally in Arizona on Thursday, the Phoenix Police Department said 11 people were transported to hospitals, treated and released for heat exhaustion. Many of Trump’s supporters waited in line for hours and some were unable to get inside before the venue reached capacity. The temperature reached a record 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) that day. Trump’s Nevada rally, his third in the state this year, came on the tail end of a Western swing that included several high-dollar fundraisers where he was expected to rake in millions of dollars. Democrat Hillary Clinton won Nevada in 2016 as did President Joe Biden in 2020, but Nevada was the only battleground state where Trump did better against Biden than Clinton. In the 2022 midterms, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, was the only incumbent governor who did not win reelection. Trump hopes his strength among working-class voters and growing interest from Latinos will push him to victory in the state. In a play for Nevada’s massive service-sector workforce, Trump said he’d seek to eliminate taxes on tips, a major source of income for food servers, bartenders and others who power glitzy Las Vegas hotels. His campaign announced a renewed push for Hispanic voters ahead of the event with a Latino Americans for Trump Coalition. Four of the speakers who warmed up the crowd before Trump took the stage were Hispanic immigrants."
3,John M. Giggie / Made by History,How Tuscaloosa’s ‘Bloody Tuesday’ Changed the Course of History,https://time.com/6985577/tuscaloosa-bloody-tuesday/,Black citizens of Tuscaloosa fought for justice and were met with violence. They persevered.,2024-06-07T13:00:00Z,"For 60 years, Black citizens in Tuscaloosa, Ala., begged city and state leaders to tell the truth about one of the most violent days in the civil rights movement. They wanted the world to know that on June 9, 1964, police and Klansmen brutalized over 500 Black people huddled inside First African Baptist Church. They called it Bloody Tuesday. It remains the largest assault and invasion of a Black church by law enforcement during the civil rights movement. More were injured and arrested than on Bloody Sunday in Selma, eight months later. Survivors of Bloody Tuesday, now in their 70s and 80s, recently shared their experiences with the FBI and local law enforcement. They preached a simple truth: “The memory you chose. That’s who you are.” The stories we tell—or don’t tell—shape our lives. Still, they worry their grandchildren will never learn their history in school, and it will die when they do. On March 4, 1964, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., then co-pastor with his father of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, returned to Montgomery, Ala.,where he had launched the bus boycott that catapulted him to national prominence eight years earlier. He came to the state capitol to vent his anger over the slow pace of racial change and announce a bold new campaign to leaders from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. “Time has come for massive assault on segregation in Alabama,” he vowed. “We will never stop until justice runs down like water.” He identified Tuscaloosa as an early target because breaking segregation there would carry enormous significance.   Read More: The Problem With Comparing Today's Activists to Martin Luther King Jr. Tuscaloosa, the fourth largest city in the state, was the national headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan and home to its Imperial Wizard, Robert Shelton. There was no deadlier or more powerful white supremacist in the country. The city’s history of racial violence was as vicious as any in the state. The recent battle in Tuscaloosa to integrate the University of Alabama, the last all-White university in the South, had made national news. Nearly 18,000 Black people, a third of the population, lived in Tuscaloosa and had built a dense network of Black churches, clubs, and businesses. It protected them from the indignity and danger of living in a segregated city, where challenge to the color line brought swift arrest, or worse: Tuscaloosa County registered over 100 lynchings and nearly two dozen attempted lynchings since Reconstruction. Black people had staged protests before, though none produced lasting change. Many attended or had graduated from Stillman College, one of the jewels of Black higher education in the state and a hotbed of political activism. On March 8, 1964, King installed one of his closest disciples, Rev. T. Y. Rogers, as pastor of First African Baptist Church and told him to desegregate the city. “There are [those] who will tell you to put on the brakes,” King thundered from the pulpit. “Tell them you have had on the brakes. Now you want to get going down the highway of freedom and equality.” As soon as King left Tuscaloosa, Rogers went to work. The Black community picketed stores that refused to serve them, boycotted merchants that overcharged them, and paraded in front of a city hall that ignored their calls for equality. King sent top SCLC leaders to provide counsel, including Rev. C.T. Vivian and Rev. Andrew Young. Klansmen took notice and beat protestors, shot them with pellet guns, and doused them with acid. Police did little to stop the violence, and sometimes joined in. Read More: Campus Protests Are Called Disruptive. So Was the Civil Rights Movement Still, Black Americans protested. Their demonstration on June 9 was to be their largest one yet, to march downtown to drink from white fountains and use restrooms reserved for whites in the new county courthouse. But as they prayed inside First African Baptist, police and sheriff’s deputies smashed the stained-glass windows with water from a fire hose and filled the church with tear gas. When people stumbled outside, police beat and arrested as many as they could. They swept the inside of the church, routing out the elderly and the very young hiding in closets. Nearly 100 went to jail, 33 were hospitalized, and dozens more received care at a local barbershop. The scale and ferocity of the assault dwarfed prior acts of police aggression in the city and recalled memories of Bull Connor’s brutal attack on protesters in Birmingham a year earlier in May 1963. It sparked doubts that the promise of democracy would ever extend to Black citizens.  “How could this happen in Tuscaloosa?” cried Rogers, who had been arrested before the start of the attack and forced to watch it unfold from the front seat of a police car. “How could this happen in America?”   The Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace publicly defined the assault as an act of Black rebellion and the start of a coup against the state. Founded in 1963 to monitor Black activism for the governor and legislature, the commission spied on civil rights workers and threatened their lives. Most white journalists blamed Black protesters for instigating the violence. Black newspapers reported more accurately, but only briefly. The University of Alabama made no public statement about Bloody Tuesday. And other events soon grabbed the nation’s attention during the summer of 1964, which civil rights activists called “Freedom Summer.” Unlike the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in September 1963, no local, state, or national agency ever investigated what happened in Tuscaloosa on June 9, 1964. As a result, those who lived through the police attack on First African Baptist never testified about their experience and how it shaped their lives in a formal public setting. Nor were the white people who participated in the violence, or stood by while it happened, forced to speak about their actions or held accountable. On the 60th anniversary of Bloody Tuesday, the cost of forgetting is clear. The American public typically tells the story of the civil rights movement by centering King in the narrative and recalling heavily documented events, often ones featuring extreme violence that we hope are exceptions. They are not. Read More: What Martin Luther King Jr. Said at the March on Washington About Police Brutality Far from the TV cameras and reporter’s eye, in small towns and cities like Tuscaloosa, everyday Black citizens persevered despite the overwhelming power of police and white citizens. Immediately after Bloody Tuesday, Black men formed an armed self-defense group called the “Defenders” to protect their neighborhood. They succeeded in thwarting future attacks by the Klan, engaging in gun battles with them when they tried to block integration efforts or harm Black citizens. Black women flooded the ranks of protestors, leading marches and raising money to a degree rarely seen. Together, and strengthened by the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on July 2, they forced the city to integrate by year’s end. Victory in Tuscaloosa emboldened other Black protestors and unnerved white politicians, leading to extreme measures like the attack by State Troopers on marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma in March 1965. Viewed like this, the story of Bloody Tuesday reveals a radically different American history, one defined by ordinary Black men, women, and children surviving a relentless campaign of repression waged by law enforcement and white citizens. In the face of this violence, they fought to secure the freedom and equality promised to them a century earlier. Recently Alabama, like other states across the nation, passed a law forbidding teaching about “divisive concepts” in the classroom. Teachers are made to fear introducing students to themes of slavery, segregation, and racial justice. They may never offer a lesson about Bloody Tuesday. But a failure to reckon with the history of events like Tuscaloosa’s Bloody Tuesday obscures the white violence and Black struggle for liberty that lie at the heart of U.S. history and American people’s ongoing pursuit of democracy.

Giggie is the Director of the Summersell Center for the Study of the South at the University of Alabama and author of Bloody Tuesday: The Untold Story of the Struggle for Civil Rights in Tuscaloosa.

4,CHRIS MEGERIAN and ZEKE MILLER / AP,Biden Looks to Pointe du Hoc to Inspire Push for Democracy Abroad and at Home,https://time.com/6986741/bidenpointe-du-hoc-democracy/,President Joe Biden on Friday looked to summon Americans to defend democracy from threats at home and abroad — and cast an implicit contrast with Donald Trump — by drawing on the heroism of Army Rangers who scaled the seaside cliffs of Pointe du Hoc in the D-…,2024-06-07T17:24:38Z,"POINTE DU HOC, France — President Joe Biden on Friday looked to summon Americans to defend democracy from threats at home and abroad — and cast an implicit contrast with Donald Trump — by drawing on the heroism of Army Rangers who scaled the seaside cliffs of Pointe du Hoc in the D-Day invasion 80 years ago. The same spot was etched in the nation's political memory in 1984, when President Ronald Reagan, honored the “boys of Pointe du Hoc” and drew common cause between their almost unthinkable feat in the face of Nazi Germany's tyranny to the then-Cold War struggle against the Soviet Union. Now, Biden sought to channel both historic moments to advance his own vision for the country’s global role amid two grueling wars and the persistence of former President Trump, who has continued to lie about his 2020 election loss and threatened to dismantle U.S. commitments overseas. “As we gather here today, it’s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day June 6, 1944,” Biden said. “It’s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us. They’re asking us what will we do. They’re not asking us to scale these cliffs. They’re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.” While ostensibly an official speech, coming a day after Biden marked the anniversary of the Normandy landings with solemn ceremonies alongside allies, Biden's remarks were steeped in political overtones, as his campaign makes a renewed play for national security-minded Republican voters who lionized Reagan and have never warmed to Trump's “America First” foreign policy. “They’re not asking us to do their job,” Biden said of the “ghosts of Pointe Du Hoc."" ""They’re asking us to do our job: to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up aggression abroad and at home, to be part of something bigger than ourselves.” A day earlier, Biden paid his respects to the D-Day force in an emotional ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery that was also attended by dozens of veterans in their late 90s and older. As Navy officer recited “The Watch,” affirming that a new generation was taking up their post in defense of freedom, and a twenty-one gun salute cast eerie smoke over 9,388 white marble headstones, the president grew heavy-eyed and pumped his fist as as an F-35 flypast performed a missing-man salute. Biden, at 81 not even a generation removed from the Normandy fighters, cast himself — and the nation — as their inheritors in the timeless struggle between freedom and tyranny. But the country’s willingness to take up their mantle has in many ways never been more uncertain amid the possibility of Trump's return to the White House. “We're the fortunate heirs of the legacy of these heroes — those who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc,"" Biden said. ""We must also be the keepers of their mission ... the bearers of the flame of freedom they kept burning bright."" It comes as Biden is also seeking to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza — to free hostages held by the militant group and surge humanitarian assistance to civilians — while also trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy to confront China’s rising power in Asia. “Does anyone doubt they would move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?” Biden said. Before flying to Normandy, Biden sat down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday in Paris, where he stressed the U.S. commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion and for the first time publicly apologized to the Ukrainian people for a monthslong congressional holdup in American military assistance that let Moscow make battlefield gains. It was their first meeting since Biden signed the legislation authorizing the additional military assistance. He also announce a new $225 million in ammunition shipments, including rockets, mortars, artillery rounds and air-defense missiles. “I apologize for those weeks of not knowing what’s going to happen in terms of funding,” Biden said, but insisted that the American people were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. “We’re still in. Completely. Thoroughly,” he said. Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters that Biden’s speech would focus on sacrifices made by U.S. soldiers during “an existential fight between a dictatorship and freedom.” “He’ll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how if we bow to dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price,” Sullivan added. Pointe du Hoc is located on the sheer cliffs between Omaha and Utah beaches. Before D-Day, the Nazis were believed to have stationed artillery there, which would have allowed them to shell critical landing zones for Allied troops. Army Rangers used ropes, ladders and their hands to scale Pointe du Hoc while under fire. When they reached the top, they realized that the artillery had already been moved elsewhere and only decoys remained. The weapons were tracked down nearby and disabled, and the Americans spent two days repelling Nazi counterattacks. The mission was memorialized by Reagan on the 40th anniversary of D-Day in 1984. “These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc,"" he said. ""These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.” Reagan's speech, coming as the Cold War with the Soviet Union remained underway, was also a call for the U.S. to not turn its back on Europe. “We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars,"" he said. ""It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We’ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.” It's a view that would likely put him out of step with the modern Republican Party, which under Trump's leadership has become increasingly skeptical of foreign entanglements. Biden highlighted the contrast during his State of the Union this year. “It wasn’t that long ago when a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, thundered, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,'” a reference to another famous speech in Berlin. “Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, ‘Do whatever the hell you want.’” Trump made that comment at a February rally in South Carolina, warning European allies not to be “delinquent” in their military spending or he would refuse to help them as president."
5,Lea Skene / AP,Baltimore Shipping Channel Fully Reopens After Catastrophic Bridge Collapse,https://time.com/6987305/port-baltimore-shipping-channel-reopens-bridge-collapse-wreckage/,"The Port of Baltimore, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the U.S., was effectively closed for several weeks while about 50,000 tons of steel and concrete wreckage were removed.",2024-06-11T02:35:00Z,"BALTIMORE — The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which blocked most maritime traffic into the harbor. Officials announced the full reopening in a news release Monday evening. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River. The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns, sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. All of the victims were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge. The Port of Baltimore, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, was effectively closed for several weeks while the wreckage was removed. Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. On May 20, the wayward cargo ship Dali was refloated and guided back to port. The vessel had been stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow. After the Dali was moved, crews opened a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide, which means two-way traffic can resume, officials said. They said other additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width. Thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to prioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in hopes of easing the economic ripple effects. Read More: Baltimore Bridge Recovery Will Be a Key Test for Biden The announcement Monday means the commerce that depends on the busy port can begin ramping back up. Officials said a total of 56 federal, state and local agencies participated in the salvage operations, including about 500 specialists from around the world who operated a fleet of 18 barges, 22 tugboats, 13 floating cranes, 10 excavators and four survey boats. “I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore district commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. “It was incredible seeing so many people from different parts of our government, from around our country and all over the world, come together in the Unified Command and accomplish so much in this amount of time.” In a statement Monday, Pinchasin also acknowledged the loss of the victims’ families. “Not a day went by that we didn’t think about all of them, and that kept us going,” she said. The Dali lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka in the early hours of March 26. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse. Officials have said they hope to rebuild the bridge by 2028."
6,Erica Sweeney,How to Have the Best-Ever At-Home Spa Day,https://time.com/6987896/at-home-spa-day-facial-self-massage/,"An at-home spa day is an invitation to take care of yourself. Try a facial, a long shower, and these breathing exercises.",2024-06-12T16:22:55Z,"Face it: you could use a day to yourself. But if you can’t swing a whole one, how about half? What about an hour? Any amount of time works for a DIY spa day: a completely customizable way to de-stress. You don’t even need to leave your house. “The key to an at-home spa day idea is being intentional about unwinding,” says Whitney Crawford, a social worker at Thriveworks in Grand Prairie, Texas, who specializes in stress and anxiety. Doing so can release dopamine, the “feel-good” hormone that boosts mood, confidence, motivation, and energy.  It’s also a way to prioritize yourself, something that Crawford says many of her patients, especially women, don’t always do. Too often, she says, they feel shame both about feeling stressed and taking time to relax.  “Self-care is not a dirty word,” says Dr. Françoise Adan, a psychiatrist and chief whole health and well-being officer at University Hospitals Health System in Cleveland. “It’s actually a discipline if we want to bring the best of ourselves to the world.”  Research suggests that engaging in self-care can improve a person’s well-being and lower their risk of illness. And doing a home spa day is a good way to kick off a regular self-care practice, Adan says. She suggests bringing “little moments” that you’ve learned from the experience into your daily life.  An at-home spa day is an invitation to take care of yourself, she adds. How you choose to personalize yours is up to you, but experts shared some ideas for creating a relaxing experience.  Home is a comforting space, so there’s no better place to relax, says Rachel Lozina, a licensed esthetician and founder of Blue Water Spa in Oyster Bay, New York. Doing a spa day at home is also less expensive than visiting a local spa.  Plus, you’re in control, and there’s no one-size-fits-all prescription, Crawford says. Choose the activities that you enjoy most and that will help you relax. Here are some ideas:  “De-stressing can be stressful” for some, Adan notes. It’s crucial to set realistic intentions and expectations for the time and not obsess over perfection. Don’t try to do too many activities, Crawford emphasizes. She recommends choosing one or two that you enjoy most.  Read More: You’re Vacationing All Wrong. Here’s How to Have a Truly Restful Break You also don’t have to devote a full day to it, if you don’t have the time. An hour or two will be just as beneficial, she says.  Start by setting your phone to “do not disturb” mode, Lozina says. If you can, she suggests sending your spouse, children, or roommates out for the duration of your session. “Dim the lights, put on some very soft relaxing music, and light candles,” Lozina adds.  Flowers or essential oils are a nice touch, too, Adan says. Aromatherapy—lavender, citrus, and rose scents, in particular—has been shown to reduce anxiety, especially in patients awaiting medical procedures, according to a 2020 research review.  Soaking in a warm tub can help melt away stress. A small study found that “whole-body immersion bathing”—which means plunging your body up to your neck into warm water—increased blood flow and helped people feel refreshed.  If baths aren’t your thing, take a long, hot shower, Lozina says. Make it extra exhilarating by exfoliating with a gentle scrub, using a hair mask, and dabbing some eucalyptus oil around your shower.  Applying a face mask can improve circulation, boost the skin’s hydration, and provide gentle exfoliation, “all leading to softer skin that glows,” says Dr. Elizabeth Geddes-Bruce, a dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology in Austin.   But the benefits go beyond your appearance. “The skin on your face is full of neuroreceptors that take feedback from physical stimulation and send signals to your brain telling you to relax,” she says.

You can also make masks and scrubs at home using avocado, honey, oatmeal, and yogurt, she says. Avoid harsh acids, like lemon juice or apple cider vinegar, which could burn the skin. Meditation can be intimidating. People often think it’s about completely quieting the mind, Adan says, but it’s really about training the mind to be less reactive to thoughts.  Mindfulness is one way to practice meditation, and there are many YouTube videos and apps to help you get started. A review of studies found that practicing mindfulness-based therapy helped reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.  Breathing exercises are another way to relax by keeping your mind focused on counting, Adan says. She recommends 4-2-6 breathing, where you inhale for a count of four, hold for two counts, exhale for six, and repeat.  Another technique is square breathing, where you inhale for four seconds, hold it for four seconds, exhale for four, hold the breath out for four, and repeat, Crawford says.  With any meditation or breathing method, start small, maybe just 30 seconds or a minute, and then progress, she says. Gently massaging your hands, feet, head, or back of your neck can relieve pressure and help you de-stress, Adan says. Just don’t apply too much pressure.  “It should be nice and relaxing and comfortable,” she says. “Just listen to your body.”  Read More: 4 Signs Your Body Is Telling You It’s Time to Take a Break Use your hands or tools like a tennis ball or foam roller, Adan says. Lozina suggests trying a massage gun or other type of massager.   Your at-home spa day doesn’t necessarily require traditional spa activities. Lozina suggests doing any activity that helps you relax.  “Read a book or start journaling—all of these will help your mind and body relax,” she says. Drawing, coloring, or even cooking are other relaxing activities to consider, Crawford adds.  Whatever you choose, savor each step. “Relax and enjoy the whole process,” Geddes-Bruce says. “It’s all intentional, and it’s all about you.” "
7,WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS / AP,U.S. Gas Prices Are Falling. Here’s Why,https://time.com/6987499/u-s-gas-prices-falling/,"Gas prices are once again on the decline across the U.S., bringing some relief to drivers now paying a little less to fill up their tanks.",2024-06-11T17:40:20Z,"NEW YORK — Gas prices are once again on the decline across the U.S., bringing some relief to drivers now paying a little less to fill up their tanks. The national average for gas prices on Monday stood around $3.44, according to AAA. That's down about 9 cents from a week ago — marking the largest one-week drop recorded by the motor club so far in 2024. Monday's average was also more than 19 cents less than it was a month ago and over 14 cents below the level seen this time last year. Why the recent fall in prices at the pump? Industry analysts point to a blend of lackluster demand and strong supply — as well as relatively mild oil prices worldwide. Here's a rundown of what you need to know. There are a few factors contributing to today's falling gas prices. For starters, fewer people may be hitting the road. “Demand is just kind of shallow,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said, pointing to trends seen last year and potential lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Traditionally — pre-pandemic — after Memorial Day, demand would start to pick up in the summertime. And we just don’t see it anymore.” Last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. gasoline demand slipped to about 8.94 million barrels a day. That might still sound like a lot — but before the pandemic, consumption could reach closer to the 10 million barrel-a-day range at this time of year, Gross noted. Beyond pandemic-specific impacts, experts note that high gas prices seen following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and persistent inflation may have led many Americans to modify their driving habits. Other contributing factors could be the increased number of fuel-efficient cars, as well as electric vehicles, on the road today, Gross said. Some of this is still seasonal. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that gas prices typically ease in early summer because of refinery capacity. At this time of year, he said, many factors boosting prices in late winter and early spring — particularly refinery maintenance — are no longer present. “Once refinery maintenance is done, output or utilization of the nation’s refineries goes up — and that contributes to rising supply,” De Haan said. And that stronger supply, paired with weaker consumption, has led to a “bit more noticeable"" decline in prices this year. He added that U.S. refinery utilization is at some of its highest levels since the pandemic. Separately, the Biden administration announced last month that it would be releasing 1 million gasoline barrels, or about 42 million gallons, from a Northeast reserve with an aim of lowering prices at the pump this summer. But De Haan noted that such action has little impact nationally — 42 million gallons equals less than three hours of U.S. daily gas consumption. “Really, what we’re seeing right now with (declining) gasoline prices ... has been driven primarily by seasonal and predictable economics,” he said. Experts also point to cooling oil costs. Prices at the pump are highly dependent on crude oil, which is the main ingredient in gasoline. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has stayed in the mid $70s a barrel over recent weeks — closing at under $78 a barrel Monday. That's “not a bad place for it to be,” Gross said, noting that the cost of crude typically needs to go above $80 to put more pressure on pump prices. Oil prices can be volatile and hard to predict because they're subject to many global forces. That includes production cuts from OPEC and allied oil producing countries, which have previously contributed to rising energy prices. OPEC+ recently announced plans to extend three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day — but the alliance also put a timetable on restoring some production, “which is likely why the price of oil had somewhat of a bearish reaction,” De Haan said. The future is never promised. But, if there are no major unexpected interruptions, both Gross and De Haan say that prices could keep working their way down. At this time of year, experts keep a particular eye out for hurricane risks — which can cause significant damage and lead refineries to power down. “Prices move on fear,” Gross said. In the U.S., he added, concern particularly rises once a hurricane enters the Gulf of Mexico — and even if it doesn't eventually make landfall, refineries may pull back on operations out of caution. Impacts can also range by region. But barring the unexpected, analysts like De Haan expect the national average to stay in the range of $3.35 to $3.70 per gallon this summer. Gas prices typically drop even more in the fall, and it's possible that we could see the national average below $3 in late October or early November, he said. While gas prices nationwide are collectively falling, some states always have cheaper averages than others, due to factors ranging from nearby refinery supply to local fuel requirements. As of Monday, per AAA data, Mississippi had the lowest average gas price at about $2.94 per gallon — followed by $2.95 Oklahoma and just under $2.97 in Arkansas. Meanwhile, California, Hawaii and Washington had the highest average prices on Monday — at about $4.93, $4.75 and $4.41 per gallon, respectively."
8,Solcyré Burga,Animal Rights Activists Posted a Cartoon Image Over King Charles’ Portrait,https://time.com/6987521/animal-rights-king-charles-portrait-vandalized/,Two animal rights protestors vandalized the new portrait of King Charles III on Tuesday at the Philip Mould Gallery in London.,2024-06-11T19:04:20Z,"Two animal rights protestors vandalized the new portrait of King Charles III on Tuesday at the Philip Mould Gallery in London, placing a cartoon picture over the painting.   Advocates plastered posters on the original painting with a printed picture of Wallace, a popular British character from the 1989 claymation film A Grand Day Out. Protestors also added bubble speech text that reads: “No Cheese Gromit. Look At All This Cruelty On RSPCA Farms!”  The painting itself wasn’t damaged as it’s protected by a plastic layer. The advocates took action on behalf of Animal Rising, a nonprofit organization that is working to “support farming and fishing communities in a …transition to a sustainable and just plant-based food system,” in an attempt to shed light on a recently released report by the organization that allegedly found that animal cruelty was taking place at 45-randomly-selected farms across the U.K. that the organization investigated. The report cited dead pigs left in farm walkways, dead baby chickens, and salmon being eaten by sea lice as evidence.   King Charles is a patron of the RSPCA, also known as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The organization has animal rescue teams and animal hospitals in England and beyond to investigate animal cruelty and offer support. The RSPCA also labels products with an “RSPCA Assured” label as a way to signal products that were farmed, according to their welfare standards.  “With King Charles being such a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, we couldn’t think of a better way to draw his attention to the horrific scenes on RSPCA Assured farms! Even though we hope this is amusing to His Majesty, we also call on him to seriously reconsider if he wants to be associated with the awful suffering across farms being endorsed by the RSPCA,” Daniel Juniper, one of the protestors involved in the political act said, in a Tuesday press release. The painting by Jonathan Yeo—which sparked controversy when it was first unveiled last month—is the first portrait of King Charles since his coronation.  The RSPCA said that they were “shocked by the vandalism” of King Charles’ portrait. “We remain confident that our RSPCA Assured scheme is the best way to help farmed animals right now, while campaigning to change their lives in the future. RSPCA higher welfare standards have been independently proven to make lives better for millions of animals every year,"" a RSPCA spokesperson said in an emailed statement to TIME.  However, the organization said that all concerns were being taken seriously and that RSPCA Assured has “launched an immediate, urgent investigation” into the allegation made against them. There are reportedly no charges against the protestors. “The RSPCA needs to take a bolder stance on the transition to a plant-based food system, beginning with calls for drastic meat reduction. The charity can, once again, lead the way for animals in the UK, rather than keeping them in misery,” said Orla Coghlan, an Animal Rising spokesperson. "
9,Alice Park,The Next Potential Alzheimer’s Drug Clears a Big Hurdle,https://time.com/6987248/alzheimers-drug-donanemab-eli-lilly/,It’s now up to the FDA to decide whether to approve the drug.,2024-06-11T18:52:09Z,"After many years of slow progress, drug companies searching for the next big treatment for Alzheimer's disease are finally starting to see the fruits of their labors. A panel of brain and Alzheimer’s experts convened by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously on June 10 that a new Alzheimer’s drug developed by Eli Lilly, called donanemab, is effective and that the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. The agency will now take the committee’s advice under consideration as it decides whether to approve the drug. The FDA postponed its original decision on donanemab, which was scheduled for late last year, because it wanted to see more safety data on the medication. After Lilly provided additional information from a late-stage trial, the agency convened its advisory committee in June to review that safety data, as well as some of the more unique aspects of the company’s latest study.  Read More: Changing Your Diet and Lifestyle May Slow Down Alzheimer's First, Lilly used a relatively new way to identify patients whose disease is most likely to progress, relying on a PET (positron emission tomography) brain scan for a protein called tau. Many clinics still don't offer this type of brain scan, and some panel members noted that it requires some expertise to interpret the images properly. Not all hospitals have such experts available.  Second, the company allowed some patients in the trial to stop treatment after other brain scans showed they had cleared the buildup of amyloid plaques, which donanemab targets. It’s the first trial of an Alzheimer’s treatment that explores potentially stopping and starting treatment—similar to the way chemotherapy is used to treat cancer. Donanemab is the third so-called ""disease-modifying treatment"" for Alzheimer’s: a therapy that addresses the root causes of the neurodegenerative disease, rather than the symptoms. All three of these treatments are antibodies that bind to amyloid, the protein that builds up in the brains of patients and unleashes toxic effects on neurons, especially those related to memory and higher cognitive functions. In the two major studies that Lilly submitted for review by the FDA, researchers followed patients for just over three years and found that donanemab slowed progression of Alzheimer’s in people at the earliest stages of the disease by 22% compared to those receiving placebo. The study also reported a more than 80% drop in amyloid plaques in those receiving donanemab compared to placebo after three years. The biggest risk associated with donanemab involves inflammation and bleeding in the brain, a side effect known as ARIA (short for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities). Both Lilly and FDA scientists agreed that ARIA is most likely the direct result of how the drug works to remove amyloid plaques from the brain, which can weaken blood vessels and make them prone to leaking. ARIA can be monitored with regular MRIs, which are part of the treatment protocol—especially for people at higher genetic risk of Alzheimer’s with the ApoE4 genotype, who are at higher risk of developing ARIA. In Lilly’s studies, the death rate from ARIA was about 2.3% in those receiving donanemab compared to 1.9% in the placebo group after three years. After hearing presentations from both Lilly’s and FDA’s scientists, the committee members discussed the new questions that the latest trial raised: particularly how to identify patients who might benefit most from the treatment, as well as the potential of having patients cycle on and off the therapy. Regarding the right patients for the drug, which is given as an infusion over 30 minutes once a month, the committee members did not agree over whether people with a genetic predisposition for the disease—those with two copies of the risk gene ApoE4—would actually benefit from the drug. While they are at highest risk, they are also most vulnerable to the ARIA side effect, and it’s not clear from the small number of them in the trial whether the benefit for them outweighs the risk. But for the overall population, the committee members agreed that the potential benefits of donanemab were greater than the risk of ARIA. They also agreed that the use of tau PET imaging was not necessary to qualify for the drug. Some members raised concerns that limited access to the test could potentially restrict who gets the drug, if the test were made a requirement. Lilly’s studies also showed that regardless of their tau levels, people responded to the drug and slowed progression of their disease. Kevin Krudys, a clinical efficacy reviewer at the FDA, said the agency determined that the drug's “effect on amyloid plaque reduction appears to be independent of baseline tau [levels].” Read More: Your Brain Doesn't Want You to Exercise Could patients possibly stop donanemab if their amyloid levels became so low as to be undetectable, then start again if the protein began accumulating? The company reported that as the 76-week study progressed, more people were able to clear amyloid enough so that the protein was no longer detectable on their brain scans. By the end of the study, 60% of people could consider stopping their monthly infusions, researchers determined. But the FDA concluded that there were still too many unanswered questions about the data so far, including no clear guidance for doctors on which levels of amyloid would warrant restarting treatment, and what the long-term outlook of people who stopped and started would be. Lilly proposed testing people with an amyloid PET scan after one year on donanemab to determine if they could stop the therapy, but additional studies are needed to determine when and how often people should be tested, and when they should be restarted on therapy if their amyloid starts accumulating again. The committee voted that for most people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, the data showed donanemab is effective in slowing their cognitive decline, and that the benefits outweighed the risks of the medication.  However, they concluded that more studies are needed in specific groups, such as those with higher genetic predisposition for the disease, as well as different racial and ethnic groups, to see if the benefits remain consistent for them.  Still, health experts and patient groups are excited by the encouraging data on donanemab and the prospect of having more treatment options, which could transform the way the disease is managed in coming years. ""It's important to look at this milestone in the larger treatment landscape for Alzheimer's, which will entail a combination therapy and precision medicine approach,"" said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (who was not part of the committee) in a statement. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association, noted that those options may also extend beyond just medications. ""We look forward to more treatment options, and novel therapies that target other aspects of the disease, including lifestyle and behavioral-based interventions,"" she says. "

11,Matt Fuchs,How to Take the Perfect Nap,https://time.com/6986652/how-to-take-a-nap/,"Seize the daytime dip, relax before you rest, and find your magic window.",2024-06-11T12:00:00Z,"A former boss once assigned me to the only office on our floor with a column right down the middle. She apologized, but I quickly sensed my advantage. Positioning my desk behind this eyesore, I could nap after lunch without detection, head angled toward my computer screen in case someone walked in. These covert catnaps were less about laziness than productivity. They transformed me from lunch-laden zombie to fully functional human—and a better employee. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a personal napping column. But stigma around napping in American workplaces is slowly changing, in light of the growing recognition that sleep (even the daytime kind) can help productivity. One in five Americans now nap on the job. “Napping might be where nighttime sleep was 25 years ago,” says writer Daniel Pink, author of WHEN: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, which extols the virtues of napping. Some employers are realizing, “maybe napping isn’t a sign of weakness,” Pink says.  In fact, research suggests your workday siesta builds several strengths, including brain health. In our early 20s, the brain starts shrinking, which increases dementia risk and slows cognition. In nappers, though, brain size is better preserved, according to this 2023 study, possibly because naps can reduce anxiety. “We aren’t sure of the mechanisms, but there’s a strong link between stress and dementia,” says Victoria Garfield, a genetic epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool who co-authored the paper. Research also shows that napping supports heart health and boosts cognition, creativity, and memory.  Here’s how to perfect your nap to reap the benefits. It’s important to time your nap when you start getting tired but well before evening, so it won’t steal any zzzs from your overnight slumber. For most people, this Goldilocks zone is from 1 to 4 p.m. “That’s when we have a natural dip in our alertness,” says Charlene Gamaldo, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. You may get more benefits from naps when they’re taken consistently—daily, if possible—and at the same time each afternoon, plus or minus 30 minutes, Gamaldo says. This way, you’re more likely to actually sleep during the nap and fall asleep again later that night, as our bodies come to expect this routine. “We’re rhythmic animals,” says Sara Mednick, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Irvine. “Whenever you’re learning an activity, doing it regularly helps.”  And the plusses of daily napping are cumulative for brain health, whereas any one nap has a small effect, Garfield says.  You could also time your nap before making an important choice. “Naps help us solve problems and make better decisions,” says Arianna Huffington, founder and CEO of Thrive Global and author of The Sleep Revolution. “They’re a tool that every leader should use when needed.” Gamaldo recommends napping for 20-40 minutes, which can improve cognitive function and performance. It’ll be a satisfying snooze, yet it’s short enough to avoid deep sleep, which is harder to wake from. She calls this length the “magic” window.  Read More: 4 Signs Your Body Is Telling You It's Time to Take a Break Some research points to shorter, 15-20 minute naps. The right length may depend on your fatigue level and the unique way your brain shuts down for sleep, Garfield adds. Mednick thinks longer daytime dozing is underrated. If you rest through the deep-sleep stage, your brain will cycle back to lighter sleep after about 60 minutes. At that point, waking up is easier, you’ll feel more rested with better emotional control, and you won’t sacrifice any sleep later on. “When people regularly take longer naps, their nighttime sleep is similar to non-nappers,” Mednick says—so the extra rest is a bonus, instead of taking away from nighttime shut-eye. She suggests increasing your duration gradually over several weeks to get used to it. Pre-gaming your naps with progressive muscle relaxation can improve the quality of your rest. The technique involves contracting and relaxing muscles throughout the body while focusing on your breathing.  Autogenic meditation is another approach that could serve as a useful warmup to napping, Mednick says.  With this type of meditation, you conjure mental images that induce peaceful feelings, such as heaviness in your limbs, aimed at destressing the nervous system. “These are ways of slowing down your physiology to help you access a state that is deeply restorative,” says Mednick, who also authored The Power of the Downstate. Delphine Oudiette, a neuroscientist who researches sleep, dreams, and creativity at the Paris Brain Institute, recommends experimenting over a weekend with different strategies and timeframes. “Just see if you feel regenerated or not,” she says.  Take pride in cultivating the perfect environment for daytime rejuvenation. Many veteran nappers have a dedicated napping couch, which their bodies learn to associate with daytime sleep. Pink wears a sleep mask, earplugs, and sometimes headphones over the earplugs. “It’s my poor man’s nap pod,” he explains. “I like the full immersion.” Gamaldo advises her patients to “simulate a cool dark cave.” You may prefer to nap under a soft light, so your body senses it’s still daytime, potentially making the nap less intrusive on evening sleep. Most importantly, keep your ambiance consistent if possible, whether it’s your couch, car or cubicle. “You want similar cues around you each time,” Mednick says. Read More: Do Less. It's Good for You Adam Horowitz, a cognitive scientist and visiting research fellow at Outer Coast College who focuses on sleep and dreams, plays thunderstorm recordings as an audio cue that it’s naptime, but you can learn to associate just about any soundtrack with napping. Horowitz used to play his ukulele before sleeping, he told me—and yawned at the thought of it. Clear your nap area of any gadgets buzzing with afternoon notifications, advises Huffington. At Thrive Global, she encourages employees to use a designated nap room.  Before putting her phone away, though, Huffington uses it to play her Thrive Reset (a tool on Thrive’s platform) with photos, music, and quotes that bring calm and joy while breathing deeply. “Just 60 seconds of breathing has a dramatic effect” on reducing fight-or-flight mode while nurturing nap mode, she says. Before napping, set yourself up for success afterward. It sounds counterintuitive, but drinking some coffee beforehand can invigorate you when you wake up (especially if combined with zippy wake-up music). Metabolizing caffeine takes about 30 minutes, the length of a nap, so your rested feeling after waking up will be amplified by the caffeine jolt, according to some research. Pink takes it a step further: drinking coffee right after waking up, in addition to before. “I’ll admit to working both sides of it,” he says. (Experiment to find what works best for you: Avoid afternoon coffee if it disrupts your nighttime sleep.) Instead of engineering an energy blast when waking up, you may want to just try to ensure you can get to sleep during the nap. Teas with ginseng, blue lotus, or mugwort may help with inducing sleepiness, Horowitz says, though the effects vary from person to person. Avoid spicy foods and sugary carbs; acid reflux and blood glucose crashes don’t make for pleasant wakeups. New research in napping points to an old trick for creativity: Thomas Edison liked to hold a steel ball while napping. As he nodded off, the ball would fall and hit the floor. The sound woke him in a dreamy state, providing unique windows into his subconscious that sparked new ideas. Oudiette, the researcher in Paris, studied this strategy in modern-day nappers. She found that falling asleep for just 15 seconds, before the ball drop, tripled their chances of solving a math problem requiring creative insight. Read More: Why Your Breakfast Should Start With a Vegetable But you may not need the ball trick. Just napping with an alarm set for 60 minutes or a bit longer leads to a 40% increase in creativity, Mednick has found. “There’s this space between wake and deep sleep where these interesting ideas are bopping around, and we can maneuver inside there,” she says. An amateur musician, Mednick was recently struggling to write a song. Just before napping, she reviewed the elements she wanted to include. After she got up, the song flowed right out. In a study last year, Horowitz tested his own technology for nurturing sleep-related creativity. As study participants fell asleep, this device verbally prompted them to dream about trees. Post-nap, they wrote more creative stories about trees, compared to control groups. Napping opens up some helpful distance between you and the problem you’re working on, similar to gleaning insights after taking a walk or shower—but napping is “an intensified form of mind wandering,” Horowitz says. . Studies show that naps can boost memory and learning, regardless of how often you take them. Gamaldo recommends naps when cramming for college exams. Reviewing test materials and then napping “will cement your knowledge,” she advises, especially if you revisit the info after waking up. Naps also help with recalling learned skills. Not everyone needs to nap. Oudiette doesn’t. “When I’m tired, I just like to close my eyes,” she says. “It’s helpful even for two minutes.” The biggest thing is taking time to rest, no matter how. “You could lie down and stare at the ceiling,” she says, “but you’re not on your laptop or phone. "

Says",https://time.com/6987367/war-crimes-israel-hostage-rescue-raid/,The dramatic weekend raid rescued four Israelis and killed at least 274 Palestinians in Gaza's Nuseirat camp.,2024-06-11T12:13:21Z,"The U.N. human rights office has expressed concern about possible war crimes committed by both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups during a Saturday raid into Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp that rescued four Israeli hostages and killed hundreds of Palestinians.  “It was catastrophic, the way that this was carried out in that civilians—again—were caught smack bang in the middle of this,” Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the U.N., told the Associated Press.   Laurence said that Israeli forces may have violated the laws of proportionality, distinction, and precaution after at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid, according to Palestinian health officials. Laurence also said that Palestinian armed groups holding Israeli civilians hostage in densely populated areas are creating “added risks” to both Palestinian civilians and the hostages. “All these actions by both parties may amount to war crimes,” Laurence said.  The U.N. spokesman called for the release of all remaining hostages, return of the remains of deceased hostages, and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners.  This is not the first time concerns about war crimes have been raised amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Last month, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor Karim Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

13,Time,FDA Issues Warning on Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning in Pacific Northwest,https://time.com/6987287/fda-warning-paralytic-shellfish-poisoning-pacific-northwest/,The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says consumers should avoid eating shellfish from Oregon and Washington state.,2024-06-11T00:14:20Z,"Portland, Ore. — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says consumers should avoid eating shellfish from Oregon and Washington state as they may be contaminated with toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. At least 31 people have been sickened in Oregon so far, according to state health officials. Here's what to know about the federal agency's advisory. The warning says to avoid oysters and bay clams harvested from Netarts and Tillamook bays in northern Oregon since May 28, as well as shellfish harvested from areas around Willapa Bay in southern Washington since May 26. They may be contaminated with high levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Shellfish harvested from those areas during that period were distributed beyond Oregon and Washington to Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New York. The FDA has warned restaurants and retailers in those states not to serve it. Elevated levels of toxins were first detected in shellfish on the Oregon coast on May 17, state fish and wildlife officials said. Since then, a paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreak has sickened at least 31 people in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The agency has asked people who have harvested or eaten Oregon shellfish since May 13 to fill out a survey intended to help investigators identify the cause of the outbreak and the number of people sickened. Oregon authorities have closed the state's entire coastline to the harvesting of mussels, razor clams and bay clams. Agriculture officials have also closed three bays, including those named in the FDA advisory, to commercial oyster harvesting. Officials in neighboring Washington have also closed the state’s Pacific coastline to the harvesting of shellfish, including mussels, clams, scallops and oysters, a a shellfish safety map produced by the Washington State Department of Health shows. Paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is caused by saxitoxin, a naturally occurring toxin that’s produced by algae. Saxitoxin is a neurotoxin, meaning it can damage nerve tissue. People who eat shellfish contaminated with high levels of saxitoxins usually start feeling ill within 30 to 60 minutes, according to Oregon health officials. Symptoms include numbness of the mouth and lips, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath and irregular heartbeat in severe cases. There is no antidote to PSP, according to the health agency. Treatment for severe cases may require mechanical ventilators to help with breathing. Authorities warn that cooking or freezing contaminated shellfish doesn’t kill the toxins or make it safe to eat. A “very large” algal bloom has resulted in “unprecedented levels” of PSP toxins along Oregon's coast, Matthew Hunter, shellfish program manager for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said during a briefing. The toxins have accumulated in the shellfish, sickening some people who have eaten them. While the factors that create harmful algal blooms are not well understood, certain factors — resulting from both natural processes and human activities — are believed to play a role, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Studies show that many algal species flourish when wind and water currents are favorable,” the agency says on a webpage dedicated to explaining harmful algal blooms. Some blooms, it says, stem from “sluggish water circulation, unusually high water temperatures, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and drought.” Algae growth can also increase when nutrients used in fertilizers, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen, flow into bodies of water, according to the agency. Oregon officials said it may take weeks, months or even up to a year for toxin levels to subside, depending on the type of shellfish. Mussels can accumulate paralytic shellfish poison rapidly, but also rid themselves of it quickly, according to Hunter, the Oregon fish and wildlife official. Because of this, it may take anywhere from two weeks to a month for mussels to eliminate the toxin. Razor clams, however, are slower to do so. It may take them several months to a year to cleanse themselves due to the current high levels of toxin, Hunter said. Such high levels of paralytic shellfish poison haven't been detected in Oregon in decades, according to Hunter, who cited a previous shellfish harvesting closure in the state in 1992. However, PSP has been prevalent in the regional waters for centuries, he said. The harvesting closures may deal a blow to Pacific Northwest fisheries. The shellfish industry generates $270 million each year for the region's economy, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and employs some 3,200 people."

The senator returned to his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania, and is expected to be back in the Senate for votes this week. A spokeswoman for Fetterman, Carrie Adams, said that the senator was driving the car and the accident was on Interstate 70 in Maryland. The condition of the other driver is unclear. Fetterman, 54, suffered a stroke in May 2022 as he was campaigning for his seat.

15,Alice Park,A Combined Flu and COVID-19 Shot May Be Coming,https://time.com/6986786/moderna-flu-covid-19-combination-vaccine/,The combo vaccine generated stronger immune responses than the separate shots.,2024-06-10T17:34:48Z,"As much as we’d like to think that COVID-19 is behind us, the virus isn’t going anywhere. Health officials continue to recommend that people get vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza every year for the foreseeable future, and high hospitalization rates for COVID-19 in the past winter were a reminder that SARS-CoV-2 can still cause serious disease. Soon, that may be possible with one shot instead of two. On June 10, Moderna reported that its combination COVID-19/influenza shot generated even better immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza than those elicited by existing, separate vaccines. Both of the shots used in the study are experimental. The COVID-19 portion relies on a slightly different form of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein than the existing vaccine. Instead of encoding for the entire spike protein, the combination vaccine includes two key parts of it in a way that streamlines the shot to require a lower dose—which is useful for a combination vaccine, and also potentially extends its shelf life. The influenza component of the vaccine uses the same mRNA technology behind the existing COVID-19 vaccine but targets influenza proteins in the three strains that circulated during the past season: H1N1 and H3N2 from the influenza A group, and an influenza B strain. Read More: An mRNA Melanoma Vaccine Shows Promise In a study of more than 8,000 adults ages 50 and older, about half received the combination vaccine. The other half—the control group—received two separate shots: Moderna's latest COVID-19 vaccine, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, and a flu shot (either Fluarix, if people were 50 to 64 years old, or Fluzone HD for those 65 and older). In the younger group, the combo vaccine generated about 20% to 40% higher levels of antibodies to the influenza strains, and 30% higher levels to XBB.1.5, compared to the control group. Among older people, antibodies were 6% to 15% higher against the flu strains and 64% higher against XBB.1.5 compared to older people in the control group.  “The real advantage of a single shot is that people only need to get one needle,"" says Dr. Jacqueline Miller, senior vice president and head of development in infectious diseases at Moderna. There's a public-health advantage, too, she says, since U.S. vaccination rates for both diseases are relatively low. ""When we are able to give the two vaccines as one, it could increase vaccine compliance rates, especially for those at highest risk."" Read More: How to Navigate the New World of At-Home Testing Moderna is continuing to study the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot used in the combo as separate shots as well. That data will also help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it reviews the company’s request for approval of the combination shot, which could come by the end of the year. The specific strains targeted in the shot will depend on which forms of the viruses are circulating at the time. (The company also filed a request to the FDA on June 7 to update its COVID-19 vaccine to target the JN.1 variant.)  The combination vaccine will likely not arrive in time for the flu and COVID-19 season this fall. But in coming years, a two-in-one vaccine could help to increase vaccination rates, which in turn could contribute to lower hospitalization rates for both diseases."

The billionaire withdrew his complaint a day before a California judge was set to hear OpenAI’s request for dismissal. Musk had accused the company of becoming a “de facto subsidiary” of Microsoft Corp. in violation of a founding agreement to be a non-profit that developed artificial intelligence “for the benefit of humanity.” OpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well-publicized battle since well before the court case. Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. Musk is now raising money for his own AI company that he has positioned as an alternative to OpenAI. OpenAI had argued that Musk would use pretrial fact-finding and information sharing known as discovery in the San Francisco case to get access to its “proprietary records and technology.” OpenAI also contended that Musk in 2017 backed the company’s plans to become a for-profit business and insisted it raise “billions.” OpenAI denied that there was ever a founding agreement for it to breach or that it had promised to make its technology open-source, as Musk has claimed. On Monday Musk said he would ban Apple Inc. devices from his companies if OpenAI’s artificial intelligence software is integrated at the operating system level, calling the tie-up a security risk. Representatives for Musk and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."

The United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) said in a press release last week, which USPS posted on X Tuesday, that this type of text is a scam called smishing—a form of phishing involving a text or phone number. These scammers often try to present themselves as a government agency, bank, or other company and attempt to lure the recipient into sharing their personal or financial information, such as account usernames and passwords, Social Security numbers, date of birth, and credit and debit card numbers, according to the press release. Scammers can then use that information to commit other crimes, such as financial fraud. “The Postal Service offers free tools to track specific packages, but customers are required to either register online, or initiate a text message, and provide a tracking number. USPS does not charge for these services!” USPIS said in the press release. “USPS will not send customers text messages or e-mails without a customer first requesting the service with a tracking number, and it will NOT contain a link. So, if you did not initiate the tracking request for a specific package directly from USPS and it contains a link: don’t click the link!” Read More: Why Gen Z Is Surprisingly Susceptible to Financial Scams USPS advised the public to report any smishing incidents by copying the body of the text message and pasting it into an email to spam@uspis.gov—without clicking on any links—along with providing your name and a screenshot of the text that shows the phone number of the sender and the date it was sent. If you have been impacted by the scam—for instance, if you clicked the link, lost money, provided any personal information, or if your credit has been affected—should share those details in their email. You can also forward the texts to 7726, which will help with reporting the scam phone number.

19,Chantelle Lee,‘I Didn’t Know What He Was Going to Do.’ Wisconsin Superintendent Rushed at by Dad During Graduation Speaks Out,https://time.com/6987578/superintendent-concerned-safety-wisconsin-father-storms-graduation/,The Wisconsin superintendent who was rushed at by a father at a high school graduation says the incident made him concerned for his safety.,2024-06-11T20:14:16Z,"The Wisconsin school district superintendent who was rushed at by an irate father at a high school graduation last month says the incident made him concerned for his safety and the safety of everyone else at the ceremony, and that he spent the rest of the night “looking over (his) shoulder.” The tense moment between School District of Baraboo Superintendent Rainey Briggs and the parent—identified by authorities as Matthew Eddy—occurred at Baraboo High School’s graduation ceremony on May 31, when Eddy stormed the stage and grabbed Briggs by his arm. Eddy pushed Briggs away before the administrator could shake the hand of Eddy’s daughter, who had been crossing the stage to accept her diploma and was in the process of shaking hands with school district officials. Video footage of the incident went viral in the days following the ceremony and sparked outrage online, with many people calling Eddy’s actions racist, since Eddy is white and Briggs is Black. Briggs tells TIME that initially, he did not understand what was happening on the stage. He did not recognize Eddy, and did not know why Eddy would interrupt the ceremony. After Eddy grabbed him and said “You’re not touching my f-cking daughter’s hand,” Briggs recalls, he started worrying that Eddy may try to attack him. “Am I safe right now?” he says he asked himself at that moment. “Are all the other people in this space safe?” “I didn’t know what he was going to do,” Briggs continues. “I can’t believe that this is happening. The space isn’t safe, but yet and still, I had to carry on with the event.” “From that point on, for the rest of that night, I’m kind of looking over my shoulder.” Read More: Superintendent Files Restraining Order Against Dad Who Stormed Stage at Graduation Eddy has since been issued a criminal citation for disorderly conduct. Briggs was granted a temporary restraining order against Eddy, according to local court records. Briggs also says that the district sent Eddy a letter informing him that he is no longer welcome on any School District of Baraboo properties. Eddy has not returned TIME’s multiple requests for comment, but a Baraboo Police Department report obtained by TIME reveals a little more information about the possible motive behind Eddy’s actions. According to the report, Eddy and his daughter “had past issues” with Briggs—who was named superintendent in July 2021—and “dislike him.” Eddy told the school resource officer who responded to the incident that he stormed the stage because he wanted to prevent the superintendent “from having the satisfaction” of shaking his daughter’s hand. (Officials redacted the name of Eddy’s daughter from the police report because she is a minor.) Briggs tells TIME that he does not know Eddy and has never spoken to him. Three years ago, he and other administrators had an “encounter” with Eddy regarding his daughter, which he believes is the “past issues” that Eddy referred to in his interview with police. Briggs declines to share further details about that encounter, citing student confidentiality. According to the police report, though, Briggs told the investigating officer that Eddy’s daughter had been expelled at one point from Baraboo High School, but added that he does not directly interact with parents when it comes to expulsions. “I don’t know what the issue is,” Briggs tells TIME. “Matthew Eddy has never indicated to me that there was an issue, nor the student.” When asked if he believes Eddy’s actions were motivated by racism, Briggs says that he cannot say, but that “the optics don’t look good.” He says that he has not interacted with Eddy personally since the graduation ceremony, and he still does not know why Eddy feels such anger towards him specifically or why Eddy chose that moment to express it. “Matthew Eddy is the only person that can truly say what his motivations were,” Briggs says. “I don’t want to speak for Matthew Eddy.” According to the police report, the investigating officer told Eddy after the incident that his actions were “not acceptable” and “could have been handled in a much more appropriate way” that did not disrupt the ceremony for everyone else, including his daughter. When the officer asked Eddy if he was sorry for his actions, Eddy said he was, but only for the sake of his daughter. The officer said in the report that he believes this was something Eddy had “pre-planned.” Briggs says the incident with Eddy has caused him “to be a little bit more cognizant” of his surroundings and of his safety. Immediately after the ceremony, Briggs left the school to drive home and called his wife to tell her what happened, who was shocked by the news. The incident has not only affected him and his family, Briggs says, but also the district community. He says students who should have been celebrating their graduation had this important moment interrupted by Eddy’s actions. “It created more attention in the community at an event that should have been celebratory of 250 students, even his daughter,” Briggs says. “My heart goes out to his daughter, my heart goes out to the other 250 students.” “If I could speak to Mr. Eddy, I guess the one question that I would have for him is: Why then? Why not talk to me three years ago?” Briggs continues. “How do you see yourself restoring the situation based on the harm that’s caused to the community?” Briggs says he wants to emphasize that this incident with Eddy is not representative of the Baraboo community. “I don’t want this one situation … to have this lasting impact on this community in a way that causes people to not want to be here, that causes people to think that this is the worst community in the country, because it isn’t,” Briggs says. “It’s a very strong community. … There’s a lot of people who care.” Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories here"

Here’s How,https://time.com/6988472/us-passport-online-renewal-state-department/,"If you’re a U.S. citizen, you may be able to renew your passport online now.",2024-06-13T20:20:29Z,"If you’re a U.S. citizen, you may be able to renew your passport online now. The updated online passport renewal system is being rolled out on a beta basis over the next several months, the U.S. Department of State said. The department said that it is preparing for an official launch of the updated system, but did not give a timeline for when it will be fully implemented. The beta version was launched Wednesday. Travelers who submit online will not be able to travel internationally for at least eight weeks from the date they submit a renewal application because of the system’s beta status. President Biden signed an executive order in 2021 to allow online passport renewal as part of pandemic recovery efforts; but when the program rolled out in 2022, it was temporarily halted—until now. Here’s everything you need to know about the new process. The department said that people who want to renew their passport online must meet several different requirements, including that their passport has been valid for 10 years (issued between 2009 and 2015), they are 25 or older, and they are not changing their name, gender, or place of birth.  Check out the full list of requirements, here. If you do not meet these requirements, you can renew your passport by mail or in person at a passport agency or center, the department said. Read More: How Long Does It Take to Get a Passport? Here’s What You Need to Know The online system will only be open for a limited window each day at 1 p.m. eastern time, a department spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. The spokesperson said, though, that that time could change as the department monitors the system’s performance. The department warned that you may not be able to start your application on the day you choose; the system will close once the daily application threshold is reached. The department did not specify what the threshold is, but a spokesperson told TIME that it was a limited number that will gradually increase over time so that the department can track any problems that may arise with the updated system. The department emphasized on its website that limiting the number of applications each day is “an important and standard part of the software development process.” The limited service will run for the next several months. The department said that if you are not able to start your application on a specific day, you should try to do so on another day. The processing time for a renewed passport will be the same as if you were renewing by mail To apply for a passport renewal online, you can create an account on the MyTravelGov homepage, and then click on the “Renew Your Passport” button on the homepage to start the application. You can save your application and finish filling it out later, but you have 30 days to complete your application after you start it, otherwise you will need to start over, the department said. You will have to enter information from your most recent passport as part of your application. The department advised that it may experience temporary technical issues, as the system first launches. You will need to enter your travel plans as part of the application process so the department can ensure that you meet the online renewal requirements. You will also need to upload an original, digital photo in .JPEG file format (it cannot be a selfie, and it cannot be a scan photo or a photo of an already printed photo). You can go to the Online Passport Status System to opt to receive email updates about the status of your application. The department will notify you when your application is in process, approved, and when it sends your passport. It will also notify you if it needs more information to process your application.

21,Solcyré Burga,What to Know About the Karen Read Trial,https://time.com/6988533/karen-read-trial-what-to-know/,The case of a Massachusetts woman on trial for allegedly fatally running  over her boyfriend with her SUV has garnered attention.,2024-06-13T22:06:58Z,"A Massachusetts woman is currently on trial for allegedly killing her boyfriend in Jan. 2022 when authorities say she ran over him with her SUV, leaving him to die.  Karen Read, 44, has been charged with the murder of 44-year-old John O’Keefe, a Boston police officer, in a case that has sparked great media attention, spawned conspiracy theories, and even prompted protests in support of Read.  Internet blogger Turtleboy, also known as Aidan Kearney, has drawn attention to the case and publicly shown his support of the Read, but his involvement has been tainted with trouble as he currently faces charges of witness intimidation.    Since the trial began on April 16, prosecutors have presented evidence that they say pins Read to the crime, and cross-examined key witnesses like Jennifer McCabe, a friend of O’Keefe, who told the court that Read allegedly asked her to search how long it would take for someone to die in the cold.  Defense attorneys for Read, however, argue that O’Keefe died because of a fight that happened inside a friend’s home in Canton, Mass. where O’Keefe’s body was found. They’ve also alleged that police are trying to frame Read. Read has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on $100,000 bail.  Here’s what to know about the case.   Read is facing charges for second-degree murder, manslaughter while under the influence, and leaving the scene of personal injury and death—to which she has pleaded not guilty. She was still in a relationship with O’Keefe at the time of his death, though court documents have shown that the relationship was strained.  Read and O’Keefe were out drinking at the Waterfall Bar and Grill in Canton, Mass., 20 miles outside of Boston, on Jan. 28, 2022 after a night out of drinking, according to court documents. Prosecutors say that Read then dropped O’Keefe off at the then-home of retired police officer Brian Albert in Canton. (Albert sold the home in 2023.) Albert testified on May 10 that neither O’Keefe or Read entered his house that night.  In the early morning hours, Read allegedly left O’Keefe a voicemail saying that she hated him, according to court documents. At 4:23 a.m. Jennifer McCabe received a phone call informing her that Read was worried because O’Keefe was not responding to any calls and did not come home. About a half-hour later, prosecutors say Read called another woman whose spouse was friends with O’Keefe saying, “What if he's dead? What if a plow hit him?” Read and two other women then went looking for O’Keefe. At about 6 a.m., Read called the Canton Police Department to report that she found O’Keefe lying in the snow outside of Albert’s home, according to court documents. The medical examiner found that O’Keefe died from blunt impact head injuries and hypothermia.   Read’s attorneys have argued that O’Keefe got into an argument with people inside Albert’s home and that his beaten body was later dumped outside. They have pointed to wounds on O’Keefe’s arms which they said were from a dog attack to try to substantiate their claims. They claim investigating officers are trying to frame Read for O’Keefe’s death. Police also found red tail light pieces, a shoe, and clear plastic pieces at the scene, according to court documents. The defense alleges that the broken tail light on Read’s car occurred when she left her driveway and hit O’Keefe’s vehicle. A first responder testified in court in early May that Read was distraught and shouted “I hit him” when asked by paramedic Katie McLaughlin if there was any trauma that O’Keefe had endured, according to the Boston Globe.  The defense also attempted to shroud the case in doubt after presenting text messages sent by lead investigator on the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, that displayed the officer’s distaste for Read.  Proctor testified on Wednesday about inappropriate messages he sent regarding Read after O’Keefe’s death. During the seventh week of the trial, it was revealed that Proctor had sent a text to his sister saying that he hopes Read kills herself. Proctor claimed that the message was a “figure of speech” while being cross examined by defense attorney Alan Jackson during the trial. Proctor also called Read a “whackjob” to others and texted his bosses that he had not found any nudes so far when looking through Read’s cellphone, according to court documents.   Massachusetts State Police Lt. Brian Tully said he was aware of the messages and had expressed his discontent with their unprofessional nature. Tully also reported the messages up the chain of command.   ""We followed the facts and evidence which showed Ms. Read hit Mr. O'Keefe with her vehicle. Yes, at times I got emotional because of that and I said some stuff, texted some things I shouldn't have. But it was based off [of] the evidence,"" Proctor said in court. ""These juvenile, unprofessional comments have zero impact on the facts and the evidence and the integrity of this investigation.” Proctor is currently under investigation by the Massachusetts State Police—though it is not clear why. He has said that the messages were “unprofessional and regrettable.”"

Trump said he saw a deepfake video of himself promoting a product that was so convincing it caused him to question whether it was real. He went on to note his worry that the harms of deepfakes could be much greater, describing a scenario where a deepfake video of the President of the United States saying “we have just sent thirteen nuclear missiles…and they will hit their targets in 12 minutes and 59 seconds'' could cause a rival leader to preemptively initiate a retaliatory strike. Trump says he asked Elon Musk whether there would be any way for this hypothetical leader to discern the authenticity of the video; Musk is reported to have said “there is no way”.  The idea of misinformation increasing the risk of a nuclear war is not entirely hypothetical. In September 1983, at the height of the cold war, a Soviet early warning system incorrectly detected 5 incoming missiles. Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov chose to ignore the reports, potentially averting a nuclear catastrophe. More recently, in December 2016, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif directed a nuclear threat at Israel after being taken in by fake news. Experts have warned that deepfakes could heighten the threat of nuclear escalation for years to come. Trump stressed what he sees as the importance of America being at the forefront of the technology’s development. “We have to take the lead over China,” he said, noting that AI systems are extremely energy-intensive. This energy is necessary both to power the computer chips used to train the systems and to keep them from overheating. He went on to say that environmentalists’ concerns over energy use could “hold us back,” causing America to lose ground to China.  To date, computing chips and human talent—rather than energy—have proved to be the most crucial factors for AI developers; however, in April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed concerns that energy could become a bottleneck in the future. For years, big tech companies have invested in clean energy to offset their carbon footprints, although China remains the world leader in renewable energy. Read More: Who Is Holly Valance? Former Pop Star and Actor Raising Millions for Trump Campaign Fear of environmentalists causing the U.S. to lose-out to China is a well-worn theme for Trump, who in 2012 tweeted “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” He later said climate change is not a hoax in January 2020, although he continues to go back and forth on this point. In the interview with Paul, Trump called Biden “the worst president in the history of our country”— emblematic of the polarized nature of American politics. Yet concern for the risks posed by AI seem to bridge the partisan divide. In October last year, Biden passed an Executive Order which sought to address some of AI’s dangers, including deepfakes, and to maintain U.S. dominance in AI. In May 2024, a bipartisan group of senators, led by Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), unveiled their “AI roadmap” that calls for the implementation of guardrails against these risks, while investing billions in the technology. Trump recounted meeting “super geniuses” in San Francisco, who helped him make sense of AI. “They gave me $12 million for the campaign,” he said. “You know, four years ago they probably wouldn't have.” Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories here "

Though King Charles III’s actual birthday is on November 14, Trooping the Colour has been the ceremonial celebration of the monarch’s birthday since 1748. The event is performed annually with a Horse Guards Parade in London, England, by regiments of the Household Division. The event is marked with the King conducting an inspection of his troops. This year, after his diagnosis with cancer, Charles reviewed the troops of his King’s Birthday Parade from an Ascot Landau carriage rather than on horseback, as he did in last year’s celebration On Friday, Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, released a personal message, stating she would be attending The King’s Birthday Parade, after all. This marked the Princess’ first public-facing official outing since she attended the Christmas Day 2023 celebrations in Sandringham. Though the royal stated she is “not out of the woods yet,” regarding her own diagnosis of an undisclosed type of cancer following a planned abdominal surgery earlier this year, she said she is making good progress. She is hoping to attend a few other events this summer as well. I have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months. It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.I am making good progress, but as anyone going… pic.twitter.com/J1jTlgwRU8 Here are 10 surprising facts about the annual Trooping the Colour event. According to The Household Division—the division of the British Army that perform State Ceremonial and public-facing duties, especially in London and Windsor—the ceremony of Trooping the Colour is believed to have been performed first during King Charles II’s reign in the 17th century, when the colors (flags) of the battalion were carried down the ranks so that they could be recognized by all soldiers. In 1748, it was decided that this parade would be used to mark the official birthday of the Sovereign. Eventually, it became an annual event after George III became King in 1760. Each year, the full parade is actually conducted three times on consecutive weekends. This year, the first occasion, known as The Major General’s Review, took place on June 1, and the second occasion, The Colonel’s Review, took place on June 8. In The Major General’s Review, the salute is taken by the Major-General commanding the Household Division. In the Colonel’s Review, the salute is taken by the Royal Colonel of the regiment whose color is being trooped—this year that was the Irish Guards The Princess of Wales was originally set to salute the Irish Guards (a Foot Guards regiment of the British Army) this year during The Colonel’s Review, but did not attend. Lieutenant General James Bucknall, the former commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, took her place to perform the salute.  Still, she sent a heartfelt letter to the Irish Guards, wishing them luck on their final rehearsal and apologizing for her absence. The Irish Guards were deeply touched to receive a letter from our Colonel, Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales this morning.  We continue to wish Her Royal Highness well in her recovery and send Her our very best wishes.  Quis Separabit@KensingtonRoyal@ArmyInLondon pic.twitter.com/KQUgB1RmBE The late Queen Elizabeth II took part in the parade throughout her reign, except for in 1955, when the event was canceled due to a national rail strike, and 2020 and 2021, due to the pandemic. The Queen appeared on the balcony for the event in 2022, but let Charles, then the Prince of Wales, take the parade. The Queen rode on her favorite horse called Burmese from 1969 until the horse retired in 1986. In 1981, 17-year-old Marcus Serjeant pointed his pistol at the Queen as she rode down in the Horseguards’ Parade, and shot six blanks. Though Burmese was visibly startled by the shots, the Queen was unharmed. After Serjeant was seized by the police and guardsman, he reportedly said: “I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be somebody.”  The horses in the King’s Birthday Parade are known as the Household Cavalry, and have been taking part in ceremonial occasions since 1660. They are often carefully selected to have good weight, temperament, and presentation. Each horse is trained for several months at the Household Cavalry Training Wing in Windsor and the Hyde Park Barracks in London, which includes both basic training and riding the horses through the streets to desensitize them to loud noises, cars, and people. In April, four horses training in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment broke loose and bolted across London. The British Army confirmed ahead of Saturday that three of these horses—Tennyson, Trojan and Vanquish—would be taking part in the parade. In the past, Trooping the Colour has been a very popular public-facing event for certain members of the royal family as they gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the parade.  This year, for the second year in a row, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, were not in attendance. Much to the delight of the public, the Prince and Princess of Wales attended, alongside Charles and Queen Camilla. The sheer size of the military parade, and the pageantry of it, makes this event unique.  Over 1,400 officers and soldiers form the parade, together with 200 horses; over 400 musicians from ten bands and Corps of Drums march and play in unison, their tunes ringing for all onlookers. The assembled military perform drills to 113 spoken commands. The Household Division’s official site calls it “this impressive display of pageantry.” Trooping the Colour was first broadcast by BBC Radio in 1927 with commentary by Major J. B. S. Bourne-May, a retired officer of the Coldstream Guards. Now, in-person onlookers hoping to catch a glimpse of the parade can stand on The Mall or on the edge of St James' Park overlooking Horse Guards Parade. This year, the leading U.K. network, the BBC, broadcast the event for virtual onlookers. That coverage kicked off at 10:30 a.m. local time, and The Daily Mail’s online portal hosted a livestream on its YouTube channel from 8 a.m. This year, Trooping the Colour officially kicked off at 10:30 a.m., but troops started to gather in London at 10:00 a.m. ahead of the royal family’s departure from Buckingham Palace. The ceremony lasts two-and-a-half hours.  It begins with the King examining the troops, and being greeted by a Royal Salute on Horse Guards Parade and a 41 Gun Salute fired by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery from Green Park. At the end, the monarch joins their family on the Buckingham Palace balcony, as they all watch a fly-past performed by the Royal Air Force. Ahead of Trooping the Colour next week, The King has presented New Colours to No. 9 and No. 12 Company The Irish Guards at Windsor Castle.His Majesty is Colonel-in-Chief of the seven Guards regiments of the Household Division, who are often seen on duty at the Royal Palaces. pic.twitter.com/n51XCSCNKk According to the Household Division, the event is a formal State Ceremonial Parade in the presence of the country's ruler, and therefore those attending are expected to dress accordingly. Military personnel are expected to wear their ceremonial attire, but the public are also expected to dress nicely. The dress code for this year stated: “Morning dress; lounge suit; or jacket, tie & trousers for gentlemen / equivalent for ladies,” specifying no denim, shorts, or sandals."
25,Sean Gregory,Let Caitlin Clark Live,https://time.com/6987117/caitlin-clark-olympic-roster-wnba/,Caitlin Clark's absence from the Olympic roster for women's basketball kicked off another round of frenzied chatter about the WNBA rookie.,2024-06-10T18:08:06Z,"Caitlin Clark’s arrival in the WNBA has set off a firestorm of chatter, discourse, and debate the likes of which we’ve never really seen in sports. The only 21st century precedent I can think of is Tebowmania, about a dozen years ago, when former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Tim Tebow enjoyed some success in the NFL, with the Denver Broncos. Tebow’s open embrace of his Christian faith sparked a conversation about the appropriateness of religious zeal in the public square, in this case the football field. The media covered Tebow 24-7. But then he went away, his throwing motion never quite pro-ready.  Clark’s not going anywhere—she’s an all-time athletic talent, the leading scorer in NCAA Division 1 history. And even the Tebow comparison is imperfect. Tebow actually did something to warrant discussion about an off-field issue like religion: he wore his faith on his sleeve. Clark is igniting a firestorm around issues of race, gender, and the growth of women’s sports, by doing what she’s always done: playing basketball, with passion.  We saw this phenomenon again going into this weekend, when word came down that Clark was left off the Team USA roster for the upcoming Paris Olympics. Media commentators of all stripes exploded with outrage. A headline on Outkick, the right-leaning sports outlet, called Clark’s Olympic exclusion an “All-Time WTF decision.” Meanwhile USA Today columnist Christine Brennan wrote on X that “having covered the Olympics for 40 years (gulp), I’ve seen some bad team and athlete selection decisions. This is the worst.” Wrote Bill Plaschke in the Los Angeles Times: “shame on them,” referring to USA Basketball officials.  “This is about what I will personally label 'The Idiocy of Team USA Women's Basketball,’” ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith said on the morning debate show, First Take, on Monday. “How dare you make this decision. It's stupid."" Read More: A Giant Mural Shows Indiana Is Already Ready for Caitlin Clark All this outrage seems odd. Sure, the core argument for Clark’s inclusion makes sense: Clark’s impact on WNBA attendance and ratings are real and well-documented. It would have been good business for USA Basketball to give her a spot. She’d keep the positive momentum for women’s basketball strong through the summer. Plus, she can more than handle her own on the court. Team USA can always use sharpshooters.  If USA Basketball put Clark on the team, and was transparent about the business benefits, fine. But since when do sports-media commentators root for ratings above all else? Since when is capitalism the core concern? What about fairness, a supposedly core tenant of sports?  Every player on the 12-person Team USA roster deserves her spot. Who would you swap out for Clark? Kelsey Plum, who won gold in 3x3 hoops in Tokyo, and has since won two straight titles with the Las Vegas Aces? Her promotion to the 5x5 team was on the merits. The three first-time Olympians, Alyssa Thomas, Sabrina Ionescu, and Kahleah Copper, are all accomplished WNBA pros who played on the U.S. team that won the World Cup in Australia in 2022. Their loyalty to the program paid off with an Olympic invite. What’s wrong with that? The youngest players on the team are 26. Clark is 22. Not a single rookie made the squad.  Read More: Even After Championship Loss, Caitlin Clark's Legacy Is Untarnished Clark recently tied the WNBA rookie record for most threes in a game and she became the fastest player to get to at least 200 points and 50 assists in the WNBA history, but these are difficult decisions. Players with more sterling pro resumes than Clark have been snubbed. Candace Parker was a two-time WNBA MVP when she was left off the Rio Olympic roster. Going into Tokyo, Nneka Ogwumike was a WNBA MVP who also earned MVP honors in the Olympic qualifying tournament for those games. She watched Team USA win gold from home. Yes, other stars right out of college, like Diana Taurasi in 2004 and Breanna Stewart in 2016, joined Olympic teams right away. But the WNBA has benefited from a deeper talent pool these past few years; that talent drove viewership and engagement to new highs even before Clark entered the league. It’s a testament to the WNBA that the Americans will be the overwhelming favorite without Clark.  And plenty of people will be invested in Team USA in Paris. The Japan-USA women’s hoops final in Tokyo averaged 7.8 million viewers, according to Sports Media Watch, the largest audience for any women’s basketball game in at least five years. For context: Clark’s WNBA debut drew 2.1 million, making it the league’s most- viewed game since 2001. An impressive Olympics showing will continue to draw eyeballs to the game, and Clark will receive a well-deserved break before continuing to sell out arenas post-Paris. She’s also on track to make the team in L.A., in 2028. Women’s basketball will be more than fine.  All overheated Caitlin Clark discourse can use a time-out. Since her arrival, many prominent pundits and athletes have had less-than-fine moments in her sphere. Indianapolis Star columnist Gregg Doyel had a cringey exchange with Clark at her debut Fever press conference, earning him a suspension. Charles Barkley called women in the WNBA “petty” due to some of the resistance the rookie has faced in the WNBA, conveniently forgetting that jealousy of male superstars is also common: according to NBA lore, during his rookie year, some veterans decided not to pass the ball to Michael Jordan in the All-Star Game. Pat McAfee called Clark a “white bitch” on his show last week. Good grief.  On the court, the understandable desire to compete and put a rookie like Clark in her place has at times gone too far. Chicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter hip-checked Clark to the ground during a game; the flagrant foul was a cheap shot. Sky rookie Angel Reese cheered the hit from the sidelines: not cool. But maybe Black players like Reese and two-time WNBA champion A’ja Wilson wouldn’t have to point out the obvious—that players like them are also driving interest, or that the WNBA has long had phenomenal players—if commentators weren’t so focused on Clark, to the exclusion of others.    Clark, for her part, seems to understand that so much of the frenzy surrounding her is out of her control and is just trying to play the game she was hired to play. “I think it just gives you something to work for,” Clark said in reaction to her so-called Olympic snub. “I know it's the most competitive team in the world, and I know it could have gone either way of me being on the team or me not being on the team. I'm excited for them. Going to be rooting them on to win gold.”  That should say it all. Let’s let the storm settle. Let Clark focus on her game. Good things will follow."
26,Angela Haupt,4 Signs Your Body Is Telling You It’s Time to Take a Break,https://time.com/6977883/what-does-stress-feel-like/,"Stomach, sleep, and immunity issues are all worth paying attention to.",2024-06-10T15:44:27Z,"If the smoke alarm in your house were beeping frantically, you’d spring into action. If your car alarm started whirring loudly, you’d investigate. And if a tornado warning was issued for your neighborhood, you'd almost certainly take cover. Yet we’re not so fast, experts agree, to react to the alarm bells ringing in our own body, letting us know we need to slow down. “The problem is, we become conditioned early on to stop listening to our bodies,” says Jennifer King, an assistant professor of applied social sciences and assistant director of the Center on Trauma and Adversity at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. That means we might miss important signs that manifest when we’re navigating prolonged, repetitive, or unpredictable stress—the kind that affects many of us. “A cascade of changes happen in the body when the stress response is activated in a sustained way,” King says. “When the dose is too big, and there’s not a clear beginning or end, that causes wear and tear on the body.” That’s why it’s so essential to pay close attention to changes in how we relate to others, what we’re experiencing physically, and how we’re coping mentally and emotionally—and to be open to feedback from the people around us. We asked experts to explain what to look and listen for, plus what happens if we ignore what we find instead of addressing it. If you haven’t taken a break—and need one—you might notice you feel gloomier than usual and are experiencing increased anxiety. “Your mood can absolutely be affected,” says Dr. Gerda Maissel, a physician in New York’s Hudson Valley who works as a patient advocate and helps people navigate the health-care system. Your thoughts might start “circling,” or whirling around on repeat in a loop. And you’ll likely “feel like you can’t remember things, or you can’t find the name for something,” she says.  Read More: Do Less. It's Good for You Meanwhile, stress can deter you from enjoying activities you once relished. Haven’t opened a book you’d been looking forward to? No longer interested in that half-finished knitting project? Consider it a hint that something is off. People who desperately need a break sometimes also lose the ability to engage in basic self-care like exercise and eating well, Maissel says. You might feel engulfed, too, by a sense of overwhelm. Maisel has noticed that people with chronic stress are often unable to cope well—with issues big and small. “I call it tipping,” she says. “If you’re like a plank on a seesaw, and you’ve got stuff weighing you down and you're trying to keep everything in balance, eventually a lot of things will slide down with you.” The people she works with get tearful, have outbursts, and can't make simple decisions because they're so overwhelmed. Have you noticed you’re experiencing new stress in your relationships with various people? Maybe you’re grumpier than usual—and snapping at your colleagues or blasting your horn at that guy who cut you off on the freeway. “You might notice you’re feeling a little more irritable or cranky,” King says. “If you’re finding that you want to isolate a little more, and keep to yourself—if that's something you weren’t already doing—that can be because of stress.” If a friend or family member approaches you about your mood, try not to get defensive or brush off their concern. Often, other people are the first to notice the warning signs. Stress can affect all of the body’s systems, says Ashley Fields, a therapist in Indianapolis who specializes in women’s issues and perinatal mental health. Research suggests it can weaken the immune system, for example, causing you to get sick more frequently. “I have grad students I teach who often tell me that right after they graduate, they get a cold or some type of sickness,” says Fields, who teaches masters-level social work at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. “It’s almost like their bodies finally stop running at high alert with classes and work and internships, and need to heal.” You might also experience digestive difficulties—like an upset stomach, constipation, or indigestion—as well as appetite changes that cause you to gain or lose weight. Stress often causes muscle tension, Fields says, triggering headaches, jaw pain, and back and shoulder pain. We don’t always realize how much tension we’re holding in our bodies until we make it a point to intentionally observe what we’re feeling, and where, she adds. Your sleep might be affected, too. Feeling more tired than usual? Or maybe you’re sleeping fine, but you’re exhausted when you climb out of bed. Both are pretty likely cues that you need to devote more time to rest and relaxation, Fields notes. When we develop “tunnel vision” and orient our lives around our daily obligations, our body starts “begging us, oftentimes, to slow down,” says Dr. Christopher Thompson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Ignoring those pleas leads to “a lot of our modern health problems.” Read More: How to Get Real Rest To understand why, consider that when we see a threat, we enter fight-or-flight mode, and our adrenal glands start releasing cortisol and adrenaline. That cortisol causes your body’s tissues to release glucose into your blood, “because you need glucose to get energy to run away or fight,” Thompson says. Meanwhile, your insulin production will decrease and your blood vessels will tighten, which is OK for one short-term event, like if you’re in an emergency situation and need to defend yourself. But when we experience it for weeks, months, or even years without relief, “we don’t recover from those cortisol spikes,” which become the norm. “It’s clearly really hurting our health.” Research suggests, for example, that chronic stress is associated with high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and arthritis. Another potential effect: weight gain. Because cortisol can increase blood sugar and impact the body’s insulin level, it can lead to belly fat as well as other weight gain, Thompson says. It can also break down muscle tissue, which lowers your metabolism. “It makes sense that chronically elevated cortisol levels are causing a lot of problems, including obesity, increased weight, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes,” Thompson says. Exactly how long it takes for lingering stress to exact this toll will vary from person to person, he adds: “The problem is how long it takes us to recognize we’re in that period of stress.” Make it a point to check in with yourself every day about how you’re feeling and what you need, Fields advises. Thirty seconds will suffice; the important thing is to make it part of your routine. “It’s a pulse on how you’re doing,” she says—and you’ll collect information that can help you make meaningful lifestyle changes. If you realize your body is pushing you toward a break, don’t let the idea create even more stress. You don’t necessarily need to take a week off work, or submit a request for a sabbatical. Claiming just a few minutes of downtime throughout the day can make a difference, Fields says: Shut your phone off for 5 minutes, draw in an adult coloring book, or call someone you love. She likes to do a quick intentional breathing exercise: Breathe in for three to five counts, and then exhale for the same number. Read More: How to Get Back to Sleep After Waking Up at Night Maissel likes to take short breaks throughout the day, usually centered around movement: She aims to climb 20 flights of stairs daily. She might step away from her computer, for example, to go upstairs to water a plant, which helps keep stress at bay. “Instead of saving up for this big dose of calm and relaxation, think about how you can strategically and intentionally pepper breaks throughout your day,” King says. “When you wake up, or you’re heading to work or school, or you’re in transition, what are the things you could be doing that allow your spikes to come back down?” Whatever you do, she says, it needs to be something you find pleasurable or fun. For King, that means squeezing in one-song dance parties throughout the day. She pops up in her office and starts bouncing and shaking. Taking a brief respite “allows your body to metabolize some of what you’ve been taking in,” she says. “We’re soothing or energizing or offering ourselves whatever we might need to come back down to baseline, and to feel ready for whatever’s coming next.”"
27,Associated Press,Florida Authorities Warn of Shark Dangers Along Gulf Coast After Three People Are Attacked,https://time.com/6986907/florida-shark-attacks-authorities-warning-gulf-coast-beach/,Authorities are using boats to patrol the ocean and warning swimmers about sharks this weekend along Florida's Gulf Coast.,2024-06-08T17:50:35Z,"SEACREST, Florida — Authorities are using boats to patrol the ocean and warning swimmers about sharks this weekend along Florida's Gulf Coast, where three people were hurt in two separate shark attacks on Friday. The attacks off beaches in the Florida Panhandle led authorities to temporarily close several beaches to swimmers on Friday. Beaches were reopened Saturday, with flags warning of high hazards. In Walton County, the sheriff's office, fire department and the state's wildlife agency were working together to patrol the water with boats and the shore with vehicles, the South Walton Fire District said in an update Saturday. Both of Friday's attacks happened in Walton County. “Please swim carefully today, respect the Gulf, stay hydrated, and look out for your loved ones,” the fire department said on social media. Red and purple flags were being used Saturday to warn swimmers of the dangers. “Purple Flags indicate the presence of dangerous marine life and single red flags indicate high hazard conditions,” the Bay County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post on Saturday. Small fish are traveling in schools near the shore this time of year, which might have been a contributing factor in the attacks, the Bay County Sheriff’s Office said. The first attack happened Friday afternoon when a woman was bitten by a shark near WaterSound Beach, the Walton County Sheriff's Office said. She had critical injuries on her midsection and arm, and part of her arm had to be amputated, South Walton Fire Chief Ryan Crawford said at a news briefing. She was flown to a trauma center. Less than two hours later, firefighters responded to another beach about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) east of the first attack “following multiple reports of a teenager injured by a shark,” the sheriff’s office said. Two teenage girls were in waist-deep water with a group of friends when they were attacked, the South Walton Fire District said. “When lifeguards and deputies arrived on scene, they found one of the females had significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand,” fire officials said in an update. She was flown to a trauma center. The other teen had what officials described as minor injuries on one of her feet. ""For two of these incidents to happen on the same day is highly unusual,"" Crawford said. The time of the attacks — in the middle of the afternoon — was also an anomaly, Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson said. He noted that sheriff's officials often warn people to be aware of sharks early in the morning and at dusk, their typical feeding times. Also Friday, in Hawaii, a woman was seriously injured in an apparent shark attack in the waters off the island of Oahu, officials said. Shark attacks are rare, according to experts. There were 69 unprovoked bites last year worldwide, and 10 of those were fatal, according to the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack File. That was higher than the recent average of six deaths per year."
28,STEPHANY MATAT / AP,Florida Sen. Rick Scott Says He’ll Vote Against Recreational Marijuana After Brother’s Death,https://time.com/6986867/florida-senator-rick-scott-plans-vote-against-recreational-marijuana/,Republican Sen. Rick Scott says he'll be voting in November against a ballot amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in his state.,2024-06-08T14:30:35Z,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida says he'll be voting in November against a ballot amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in his state, a deeply personal decision based on his brother's long history of addiction. The senator and former Florida governor said he watched his brother Roger Scott begin smoking marijuana as a teenager and then struggle with substance use for the rest of life. “People end up with addictive personalities, and so he did,” Scott said in an interview. “It messes up your life, and so that’s why I’ve never supported legalization of drugs.” When Roger Scott died in April at 67, the cause wasn't substance abuse, but rather “a life of drugs and alcohol” catching up with him, the senator said. He had lived in an apartment in Dallas, Texas, where he served jail time in 1990 on a misdemeanor conviction of possessing dangerous drugs, court records show. Rick Scott became wealthy as a lawyer and health care industry executive before entering politics. Now running for reelection, he lamented that his brother had a “tough life” and says it all began with marijuana. Scott’s no-vote on marijuana falls in line with other state and national Republicans who question whether marijuana leads to using other riskier substances. The National Institute of Drug Abuse included in a 2019 webpage that most cannabis users don’t go on to use “harder substances,” but a statement from the agency also said using THC, marijuana's psychoactive compound, may cause brain changes that could make a person more likely to develop an addiction to other drugs. Amie Goodin, who researches marijuana safety at the University of Florida, said studies have found those who use riskier drugs often previously used marijuana, but that research hasn't established whether marijuana “is actually the cause” for someone to seek more powerful substances. Florida's voter initiative would legalize recreational marijuana use if the amendment receives 60% or more yes votes this November. That would also obligate the Florida Legislature to establish regulations and a framework for production and sales. Florida is among 38 states that have legalized medical marijuana, and would join 24 others that have legalized recreational use. Scott opposes this change alongside Florida's Republican Party, which formally announced its opposition in early May. They contend the amendment would “benefit powerful marijuana special interests, while putting children at risk and endangering Florida’s family-friendly business and tourism climates.” The amendment's sponsor, Smart & Safe Florida, said on its website that approval would enable Floridians to have “accountability, transparency, and regulations” in place. Among other benefits, this could ensure legal cannabis won't be laced with unknown and potentially dangerous chemicals, it said. Voters approved medical marijuana when Scott was governor, but Scott and the Legislature placed tight restrictions on its use, including banning smokable marijuana. Cannabis advocates then sued and a court agreed to allow smokable medical marijuana just before Scott left office. His successor, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, chose not to appeal."
29,Melanie Lidman / AP,"Benny Gantz, Israeli War Cabinet Minister, Resigns Over Frustration With Netanyahu",https://time.com/6987020/israel-benny-gantz-resigns-netanyahu-government/,Gantz accused Netanyahu of mismanaging the war in Gaza and putting his own “political survival” over Israel’s security needs.,2024-06-10T02:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM — Benny Gantz, a centrist member of Israel’s three-man war Cabinet, announced his resignation Sunday, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of mismanaging the war effort and putting his own “political survival” over the country’s security needs. The move does not immediately pose a threat to Netanyahu, who still controls a majority coalition in parliament. But the Israeli leader becomes more heavily reliant on far-right allies who oppose the latest U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal and want to press ahead with the war. “Unfortunately, Netanyahu is preventing us from achieving true victory, which is the justification for the painful and ongoing price,” Gantz said. He added that Netanyahu was “making empty promises,” and the country needs to take a different direction as he expects the fighting to continue for years to come. The popular former military chief joined Netanyahu’s government shortly after the Hamas attack in a show of unity. His presence also boosted Israel’s credibility with its international partners. Gantz has good working relations with U.S. officials. Gantz had previously said he would leave the government by June 8 if Netanyahu did not formulate a new plan for postwar Gaza. He scrapped a planned news conference Saturday night after four Israeli hostages were dramatically rescued from Gaza earlier in the day in Israel’s largest such operation since the eight-month war began. At least 274 Palestinians, including children, were killed in the assault, Gaza health officials said. Gantz called for Israel to hold elections in the fall, and encouraged the third member of the war Cabinet, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, to “do the right thing” and resign from the government as well. Gallant has previously said he would resign if Israel chose to reoccupy Gaza, and encouraged the government to make plans for a Palestinian administration. On Saturday, Netanyahu had urged Gantz not to leave the emergency wartime government. “This is the time for unity, not for division,” he said, in a direct plea to Gantz. Gantz’s decision to leave is largely “a symbolic move” due to his frustration with Netanyahu, said Gideon Rahat, chairman of the political science department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He noted it could further increase Netanyahu’s reliance on extremist, right-wing members of his government, led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. “I think the outside world, especially the United States, is not very happy about it, because they see Gantz and his party as the more responsible people within this government,” Rahat said. On Sunday evening, Ben-Gvir demanded a spot in the war Cabinet, saying Gantz and the smaller Cabinet had bungled the war effort due to “dangerous” ideological decisions. Hamas took some 250 hostages during the Oct. 7 attack that killed about 1,200 people. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November. About 120 hostages remain, with 43 pronounced dead. At least 36,700 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians."
30,Tia Goldenberg / AP,How an Israeli Raid Freed Four Hostages and Killed at Least 274 Palestinians,https://time.com/6987044/israeli-raid-hostages-palestinians/,The dramatic rescue operation came with an immense human toll—at least 274 Palestinians killed. Here's what to know.,2024-06-10T10:19:02Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel's dramatic weekend rescue of four hostages from the Gaza Strip, in an operation that local health officials say killed 274 Palestinians, came at a sensitive time in the 8-month-old war, as Israel and Hamas weigh a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining captives. Both sides face renewed pressure to make a deal: The complex rescue is unlikely to be replicated on a scale needed to bring back scores of remaining hostages, and it was a powerful reminder for Israelis that there are still surviving captives held in harsh conditions. Hamas now has four fewer bargaining chips. But they could also dig in, as they repeatedly have over months of indirect negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. Hamas is still insisting on an end to the war as part of any agreement, while Israel says it is still committed to destroying the militant group. Here is a look at the fallout from the operation and how it might affect cease-fire talks: The rescue operation was Israel’s most successful since the start of the war, bringing home four of the roughly 250 captives seized by Hamas in its Oct. 7 cross-border attack, including Noa Argamani, who became an icon of the struggle to free the hostages. The raid also killed at least 274 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, deepening the suffering of people in Gaza who have had to endure the brutal war and a humanitarian catastrophe. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies. The rescue was met with elation in Israel, which is still reeling from the Hamas attack and agonizing over the fate of the 80 captives and the remains of over 40 others still held in Gaza. Israeli hard-liners are likely to seize on it as proof that military pressure alone will bring the rest back. But only three other hostages have been freed by military force since the start of the war. Another three were mistakenly killed by Israeli forces after they escaped on their own, and Hamas says others have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. “If anyone believes that yesterday’s operation absolves the government of the need to strike a deal, they are living a fantasy,"" Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-selling Yediot Aharonot newspaper. ""There are people out there who need to be saved, and the sooner the better.” Even the Israeli army's spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, acknowledged the limits of military force. “What will bring most of the hostages back home alive is a deal,” he told reporters. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year, in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, and reaching a similar agreement is still widely seen as the only way of getting the rest of the hostages back. Hours after Saturday's rescue, tens of thousands of Israelis attended protests in Tel Aviv calling for such a deal. U.S. President Joe Biden last week announced a proposal for a phased plan for a cease-fire and hostage release, setting in motion the administration’s most concentrated diplomatic push for a truce. Biden described it as an Israeli proposal, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly questioned some aspects of it, particularly its call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a lasting truce. His ultranationalist coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he ends the war without destroying Hamas. That appears to have only deepened suspicions on the part of Hamas, which has demanded international guarantees that the war will end. It's unclear if such guarantees have been offered, and Hamas has not yet officially responded to the plan. The rescue operation was a rare win for Netanyahu, who many Israelis blame for the security failures leading up to the Oct. 7 attack and the failure to return the hostages despite months of grinding war. He has reveled in the operation’s success, rushing Saturday to the hospital where the freed hostages were held and meeting with each of them as cameras rolled. Recent opinion polls had already shown him making some progress in rehabilitating his image, and the rescue operation will help. But as the elation fades, he will still face heavy pressure from an American administration that wants to wind the war down and an ultranationalist base that wants to vanquish Hamas at all costs. His main political opponent, the retired general Benny Gantz, quit the emergency wartime coalition on Sunday, leaving Netanyahu even more beholden to the hard-liners. Netanyahu is already facing criticism from some of the families of deceased hostages, who say they received no such visits and accuse him of only taking credit for the war's successes. Israel will also likely face heightened international pressure over the raid's high Palestinian death toll. “The success in freeing four hostages is a magnificent tactical victory that has not changed our deplorable strategic situation,” columnist Ben Caspit wrote in Israel’s Maariv daily. It all makes for a tough balancing act, even for someone like Netanyahu, who friends and foes alike consider to be a master politician. The operation could provide the kind of boost with the Israeli public that would allow him to justify making a deal with Hamas. Or he might conclude that time is on his side, and that he can drive a harder bargain with the militants as they grapple with a major setback. Hamas has lost four precious bargaining chips it had hoped to trade for high-profile Palestinian prisoners. Argamani, widely known from a video showing her pleading for her life as militants dragged her away on a motorcycle, was a particularly significant loss for Hamas. The raid may have also dealt a blow to Hamas’ morale. In the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas managed to humiliate a country with a far superior army, and since then it has repeatedly regrouped despite devastating military operations across Gaza. But the fact that Israel was able to mount a complex rescue operation in broad daylight in the center of a crowded urban area has at least temporarily restored some of the mystique that Israel's security forces lost on Oct. 7. The operation also refocused global attention on the hostage crisis at a time when the U.S. is rallying world pressure on Hamas to accept the cease-fire deal. But Hamas has a long history of withstanding pressure from Israel and others — often at enormous cost to Palestinians. The militants may conclude that it's best to use the remaining hostages to end the war while they still can — or they might just look for better places to hide them."

The boat was carrying some 260 Somalis and Ethiopians from the northern coast of Somalia on the 320-kilometer (200-mile) journey across the Gulf of Aden when it sank Monday off Yemen’s southern coast, the IOM said in a statement. It said search efforts were continuing and so far 71 had been rescued. Among the dead were 31 women and six children, it said. Yemen is a major route for migrants from the East Africa and the Horn of Africa trying to reach Gulf countries for work. Despite a nearly decadelong civil war in Yemen, the number of migrants arriving annually tripled from 2021 to 2023, soaring from about 27,000 to over 90,000, the IOM said last month. Around 380,000 migrants are currently in Yemen, according to the agency. To reach Yemen, migrants are taken by smugglers on often dangerous, overcrowded boats across the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden. In April, at least 62 people died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Djibouti as they tried to reach Yemen. The IOM said at least 1,860 people have died or disappeared along the route, including 480 who drowned. Monday’s sinking “is another reminder of the urgent need to work together to address urgent migration challenges and ensure the safety and security of migrants along migration routes,” said IOM spokesperson Mohammedali Abunajela."
32,Eliana Dockterman,"Pixar’s Pete Docter: If Inside Out 2 Doesn’t Succeed, We Have to ‘Radically’ Rethink Our Business",https://time.com/6986308/inside-out-2-peter-docter-interview/,"Docter spoke to TIME about you won’t see live-action adaptations of Pixar’s animated movies. (Sorry, Josh O’Connor. That means no Ratatouille remake.)",2024-06-11T13:55:38Z,"Pete Docter knows the stakes are high for Inside Out 2. Docter started at Pixar when he was 21, and quickly rose through the ranks, working on classics like Toy Story. He went on to direct films like Up and Monsters Inc. as well as the original Inside Out, the most profitable non-sequel Pixar has ever produced. In 2018, he was named Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer. He’s racked up nine Oscar nominations, with three wins. But in recent years, Pixar has found itself in a commercial and critical rut. Movies like Turning Red and Luca that were largely based on creators’ own childhoods didn’t seem to resonate with audiences the way that more universal tales like Toy Story and Monsters Inc. did. Docter points out it can be difficult to come up with original ideas that resonate with a wide audience two decades into the studio’s existence. “A lot of people say, ‘I totally thought toys came to life when I wasn't in my room.’ ‘I totally believed there were monsters in my closet,’” he says. “We're still rummaging around for things like that, but it's harder and harder to find as we're into our 28th movie or whatever.”  And ever since Disney put movies like Turning Red, Luca, and Soul (the last of which Docter co-directed) on its streaming service Disney+ during the pandemic, Pixar has struggled to coax audiences back to theaters. In the last two years, Lightyear and Elemental both failed to meet opening weekend expectations at the box office. The studio has been forced to overhaul its creative vision and business strategy by returning to the properties that won over fans in the first place, like Inside Out. Box office prognosticators have predicted that Inside Out 2 will become one of the highest-grossing movies of 2024. And theater owners are praying that it will drive families to the cinema in a year that’s been light on kid-friendly content. Overall, it’s been an abysmal year at the movies. The Memorial Day box office hit a 26-year low after several big-budget films underperformed. It may be that audiences just want to watch movies—especially kids’ movies—at home rather than forking over a hefty sum to take the family to the theater.  The future of Pixar, this year’s box office, and theaters in general may hinge, in part, on the success of movies like Inside Out 2. “If this doesn't do well at the theater, I think it just means we're going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business,” says Docter. Inside Out 2 picks up a few years after the events of its predecessor with a girl named Riley preparing for high school. The anthropomorphized emotions that live inside Riley’s head and help to steer her through the world—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear—wake in the middle of the night to a blaring “Puberty” alarm and the introduction of new roommates: Embarrassment, Ennui, Jealousy, and Anxiety. Joy (Amy Poehler) and Anxiety (Maya Hawke) tussle over how to steer Riley through the awkward teenage years.  Docter spoke to TIME about why Pixar is focusing much of its energy on making more sequels, how they can find universal ideas that connect with large audiences, and why you won’t see live-action adaptations of Pixar’s animated movies. (Sorry, Josh O’Connor. That means no Ratatouille remake.) Why did you think there was enough in the Inside Out story for a sequel? We’ve built the entire ocean for Nemo, the entire universe for Wall-E. But it turned out the biggest set we had built [when Inside Out debuted] was inside of a little girl's mind. We only saw like 3% of it in the first film. There was way more to play with, and we had a lot of leftover ideas.  But the big question is, was there something substantive? We tapped Kelsey Mann, who was head of story on Onward and Monsters University, and he ran off and thought of this idea having to do with anxiety. It felt like that's something that was really ripe.  My editor showed the trailer to her kids, and they were like, “What’s anxiety?” Do you think that concept will go over the head of a six-year-old?  Yes, though so did things like Anger or Sadness [in the first movie]. After the first film, we heard story after story of people saying, “I now have tools to talk about this stuff with my kids.” That was true especially of little boys who have a lot of trouble talking about emotions. I don't know if that's genetics or a societal thing. But either way, they really connected, especially with Anger. One of the great gifts of this project is taking these abstract ideas and making them real. You have talked about how releasing Pixar movies straight to Disney+ trained audiences to expect those movies on streaming. How do you get audiences to go to the theater for Pixar movies again? Part of our strategy is to try to balance our output with more sequels. It’s hard. Everybody says, “Why don't they do more original stuff?” And then when we do, people don't see it because they're not familiar with it. With sequels, people think, “Oh, I've seen that. I know that I like it.” Sequels are very valuable that way.  On the other hand, they're almost harder than originals because we can’t do the same idea again. We have to build on it hopefully in ways that people don’t expect.  Lightyear underperformed at the box office. If the focus is more sequels and spin-offs, what’s the lesson from that spin-off not working?   We took a long moment of self scrutiny after that didn't deliver. I think we overestimated the audience's nerd level of being like, “Oh, that kid in the first Toy Story bought a toy, and it was based on a movie. And this is that movie.” That's probably a few layers too deep. Because I think people are going, “Well, where's Mr. Potato Head? Where's Woody?”  What are you looking for when it comes to ideas for original movies that will get people to theaters? It's sort of cynical to say people want to see stuff they know. But I think even with original stuff, that's what we're trying to do too. We're trying to find something that people feel like, “Oh yeah, I've been through that. I understand that I recognize this as a life truth.” And that's been harder to do. A lot of people say, “I totally thought toys came to life when I wasn't in my room.” “I totally believed there were monsters in my closet.” We're still rummaging around for things like that, but it's harder and harder to find as we're into our 28th movie or whatever.  A recent Bloomberg article emphasized that going forward, Pixar is going to prioritize universality over specificity—which means fewer movies inspired by a creator’s specific childhood experiences, and more based on universal truths. But as journalists, we’re taught the specific is the universal. I believe that too. So how do you find that balance? I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding about that because it's not that [those movies were] too specific. But what I’ve found is sometimes, if you are telling a personal story, you’ll be like, “Oh, no, that's not the way the story goes. Because my story is this.” But we're not telling my story; we're telling a story that needs to work for a fictional character that we're creating. So there's sometimes a reluctance to let go or let the movie shape itself the way it needs to.  Nemo is very personal. Obviously, [writer-director] Andrew Stanton is not a fish, and he's not a single dad. But he recognized his own smothering of his child in an effort to protect them. He was able to springboard off of that to tell stories about octopuses and all sorts of wild, fun stuff.  The story shouldn’t come fully formed. You’re always adding and removing stuff. It’s an organic, messy process. But sometimes, your own personal experience can drive that and other times it can get in the way.  Practically, how does that work? The Pixar braintrust gives more input into every movie? Avoid being seduced by “This is really clever.” We want to drill down before they go into production to be like, what’s the core idea? Okay, this is really about the struggles of being a parent or the struggles of losing a loved one.  I know Pixar is stepping away from doing as much short-form content for Disney+ in order to focus on features. But Bluey, which has eight-minute-long episodes, has become wildly popular on Disney+. And I think part of the reason they’re so successful is we have short attention spans now. Does that pressure Pixar to explore that short-form space again?   Well, when they first announced Disney+, we immediately jumped in with a bunch of shorts. Turns out the audience didn’t want short little things from Pixar at least. It just didn't perform as well. It didn't earn its keep in terms of what we had to put into it to make them. So Disney asked us to pull back on anything that's not the features.  We’ve also found the better [a movie] does at the theater, the more successful it has been on Disney+. Initially you’d think if it does really well in the theater, nobody's going to watch it on Disney+ because we've seen it already. It's actually the opposite, which kind of makes sense. I remember as a kid I had The Muppet Show album, and I played that thing to death. As a kid you want the comfort of watching this one thing over and over and over.  That’s true for us on Disney+. I don’t know if it’s true on Netflix. I actually saw this morning that Super Mario Bros. has been on the Top 10 Netflix chart for 25 weeks. To your point, that movie did well in theaters and now it’s doing well on streaming. That’s the same model. You know, I would love to push the theatrical window more. I’m no businessman, but just creatively it’d be great to make audiences feel if you don’t see this now, it’s going to be awhile before it’s readily available at your house. I’ve been shocked by how many big-budget movies this summer have wound up on PVOD (premium video on demand) two weeks after their release.  It’s crazy.  Inside Out 2 has a 100-day release window. That feels like a statement. That’s how long we had for Elemental. When that movie came out we all said, “Oh, no, that didn’t open the way we thought it should!” But as time went on, it just had legs. I don’t know if the marketing was wrong, the space was too crowded, or people thought it didn’t look interesting. But word of mouth made people go check it out. I think that would not have happened if we came out three weeks later on Disney+. Industry analysts have really built up the opening weekend of Inside Out 2. If it doesn’t succeed, the summer box office is doomed. If it doesn’t succeed, Pixar is doomed. How do you see the stakes? I can't imagine having a better chance at a big box office than this because it's a known movie and characters that meant something to people and a really funny cast—and hopefully something meaty at the heart of it that you can take home as well.  So if this doesn't do well at the theater, I think it just means we're going to have to think even more radically about how we run our business. So far Pixar has built a business around pretty large budgets. It allows us to make a lot of mistakes and take risks, and if it doesn’t work, we can still go back and fix it.  I think if you really want to make it cheap, you think of an idea, and you make it. But if you want to make it good, you have to change and iterate a ton and that's what we've been able to do so far. If the box office doesn't support that, if the economics don't support that, we just have to make even more giant shifts.  What shifts have been made? [Pixar had a round of layoffs in May.] We’ve already been able to tuck our budgets way down. We’ve made films in much fewer weeks.  In the Monsters Inc. through Ratatouille days there was—I was going to say opulence, but that’s not the right word. There was much more freedom to explore. And now we're tightening the belt and we're really going to be targeted about when we take risks. You mentioned Ratatouille. I don't know if you're aware that Josh O'Connor, one of the stars of Challengers, has been talking nonstop on his press tour about his love of Ratatouille.  No! And there is a fan campaign to get him cast in a live-action Ratatouille. Are live-action adaptations something you guys would ever consider? No, and this might bite me in the butt for saying it, but it sort of bothers me. I like making movies that are original and unique to themselves. To remake it, it's not very interesting to me personally. That’s maybe for the best because I don’t know how you make a live-action rat cute. It would be tough. So much of what we create only works because of the rules of the [animated] world. So if you have a human walk into a house that floats, your mind goes, “Wait a second. Hold on. Houses are super heavy. How are balloons lifting the house?” But if you have a cartoon guy and he stands there in the house, you go, “Okay, I'll buy it.” The worlds that we’ve built just don’t translate very easily."
33,Julie McFadden,What a Hospice Nurse Wants You to Know About Death,https://time.com/6986598/hospice-nurse-death-lessons-essay/,"""Death is not an emergency,"" writes Julie McFadden.",2024-06-10T11:00:00Z,"I am asked all the time why in the world I would do something as difficult as working for hospice. People often ask, “Isn’t it so depressing?” It’s sad sometimes, yes. There’s really no way around that. But I don’t find my job to be depressing. In a way, it’s actually a sacred gift to me. The people I’ve met in their dying moments have changed my outlook on life, and far from depressing, I find their stories precious and inspiring. Take Jason, 80, married, with children and grandchildren. When he was diagnosed with metastatic liver cancer and it was clear that he was in his final days of life, his whole family gathered in the home where he and his wife, Susan, had raised their children. I had been Jason’s hospice nurse for a few weeks, and his condition, although terminal, remained stable. The last time I made a visit, however, his condition had changed. In the couple’s bedroom, Jason was unconscious and unresponsive. Jason and Susan’s three children and several grandchildren were gathered around his bed, thumbing through a stack of photo albums. They were laughing and crying as each of them shared their favorite family stories and memories: trips to the lake, Christmas and holiday highlights, secret childhood mischief. The love surrounding Jason was everything anyone could ask for as they moved toward death. Wanting to honor that time but also be available for whatever they needed, I stationed myself in an office space across the hall to record my notes about the visit. As I worked, I heard snippets of the family’s conversation. “We love you, Dad. We love you.” “It’s so easy to love you.” “You’ve been the best husband.” “It’s okay. You can let go.” “We love you.” The entire family had transitioned effortlessly with Jason’s sudden decline and were able to say goodbye the way they wanted. To me in the other room, it felt like a powerful, sacred love. It felt, ironically, like this type of death is what life is supposed to be all about. What I do doesn’t feel depressing because I see patients get to have these beautiful deaths, being welcomed in love to a place that’s good. I get to witness families and friends really loving each other well. I get to help people who are dying feel comfortable as they die and help them and their loved ones embrace the reality of death—which helps them live better and die better. I see the power in what is possible as we faithfully accompany people toward death. And as professionals, or as loved ones, we have the power to make a real difference in people’s lives. Read More: The Language of Hospice Can Help Us Get Better at Discussing Death So often, I hear family members dismissing the experience of the person who is dying. It can sound a variety of ways: “Don’t say stuff like that, Dad. You’re not going to die.” “Don’t talk about how much you love me. You’re not going to die.” “I don’t want to learn how to take care of the garden because you’re not going to die.” I know this can be hard, but we do the person who is dying a disservice when we don’t let them speak their truth. They know that they’re dying, and they deserve space to talk about it. Is it comfortable talking about death? Rarely. Is it a way to honor and care for the person who is dying? Absolutely. It’s always time to talk about death. Talk about it when you’re sick. Talk about it when you’re not sick. Talk about it at the Thanksgiving dinner table. There’s never a time not to talk about death. Talking about—and even simply being around—death is thought to be a painful experience. But it doesn’t have to be. Oftentimes, when a loved one is dying, I encourage their loved ones, to, pause and pay attention to what’s happening in you and around you. Notice the sense of stillness. Pause and be present in the moment. Notice what you feel and what you need. Take in the silence, or turn on music if you prefer. At some point, you’ll make the call for the body to be removed from the home. Eventually, you’ll phone everyone who needs to know. Ultimately, you’ll handle other responsibilities. One day, you’ll wash the sheets and make the bed. But when the person you love dies, there’s nothing that needs to be done immediately. Death is not an emergency. Give yourself the gift of pausing to be present.

34,"Mohammad Jahjouh, Jack Jeffery, and Kareem Chehayeb / AP",How an Israeli Raid Freed Four Hostages and Killed at Least 274 Palestinians,https://time.com/6987062/274-palestinians-killed-israel-hostage-rescue/,The dramatic weekend raid came with an immense human toll—and political fallout. Here's what to know.,2024-06-10T10:41:04Z,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — They arrived in the middle of the day, when the squat concrete buildings of the Nuseirat refugee camp are stifling and the narrow streets outside are filled with people. No one suspected a thing until the shots rang out. The Israeli raid caught everyone off guard, from the Hamas militants guarding four hostages in two different buildings to the thousands of civilians who soon found themselves running for their lives through a blistering crossfire. By the time it was over, four Israeli hostages had been brought home alive and mostly unscathed, at least physically, and at least 274 Palestinians, and an Israeli commando, had been killed. For Israel, it was the most successful operation of the eight-month war, bringing nationwide elation and removing some of the stain from the army's unprecedented collapse on Oct. 7. For Palestinians, it was a day of horror that sent hundreds of dead and wounded flooding into already beleaguered hospitals. Here's how it unfolded, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian witnesses. Noa Argamani, a 26-year-old who had emerged as an icon of the hostage crisis, was being held in one apartment and three male hostages — Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 41, were in another about 200 meters (yards) away. All had been abducted from a desert rave-turned-massacre site during the Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war. They had been moved among different locations but were never held in Hamas' notorious tunnels. At the time of their rescue they were in locked rooms guarded by Hamas gunmen. Israeli intelligence figured out where they were and commandos spent weeks practicing the raid on life-size models of the buildings, according to Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. “It needs to be like a surgical operation, like a brain operation,” he said. He said they decided to strike at midday because it would be the “ultimate suprise,” and to target the two buildings simultaneously. Planners feared that if they hit one first, the captors would hear the commotion and kill the hostages in the other. Hagari declined to say how the Israeli forces made their way to the heart of Nuseirat, a crowded, built-up refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Based on previous operations, at least some of the special forces who took part in the raid likely dressed like Palestinians and spoke fluent Arabic. Kamal Benaji, a Palestinian displaced from Gaza City who was living in a tent in central Nuseirat, said he saw a small truck with a car in front and another behind pull up in front of a building on the street where he had pitched his tent. The commandos sprang from the truck and one of them threw a grenade into the house. ""Clashes and explosions broke out everywhere,” he said. The rescue of Argamani seems to have gone smoothly, while the team extracting the three other hostages ran into trouble. Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora, an officer in an elite police commando unit, was mortally wounded during the break-in, in which all the Hamas guards were killed, Amos Harel, a veteran defense correspondent, wrote in Israel's Haaretz newspaper. Then the rescue vehicle carrying the three hostages got stuck in the camp, he said. Palestinian militants armed with machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades opened fire on the rescuers, as Israel called in heavy strikes from land and air to cover their evacuation to the coast. “A lot of fire was around us,” Hagari said. It was this bombardment that appears to have killed and wounded so many Palestinians. Mohamed al-Habash, another displaced Palestinian, was in the Nuseirat market looking for humanitarian aid or inexpensive food when the heavy bombing began. He took cover with a half-dozen other people in a damaged home. He said many other houses were hit. “We heard very loud bombing and heavy gunfire,"" he said. “We saw many fighter jets flying over the area.” The Israeli rescuers eventually made it to the coast. Zamora was evacuated by helicopter and later died of his wounds in a hospital. The military renamed the operation in his honor. Footage released by the military showed soldiers walking the hostages along the beach toward the water and helicopters whipping up clouds of sand as they took off. ‘We called the hostages diamonds, so we say we have the diamonds in our hands,” Hagari said. At the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, the dead and wounded arrived in waves — men, women and children. It's one of the last functioning medical facilities in the area and was already packed with people wounded in heavy strikes in recent days. Samuel Johann, a coordinator with the international charity Doctors Without Borders, which operates in the hospital, said it was a “nightmare.” “There have been back-to-back mass casualties as densely populated areas are bombed. It’s way beyond what anyone could deal with in a functional hospital, let alone with the scarce resources we have here,"" he said in a statement released by the group. The Gaza Health Ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed and around 700 were wounded. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tallies, but said the dead included 64 children and 57 women. Khulood Shalaq, who was being treated at another hospital with her wounded 1-year-old nephew, said 14 members of her family were killed in the raid, with some still buried in the rubble. She said at one point she saw four helicopters launching missiles into the camp. “The streets are filled with dead bodies,"" she said. Hamas later released a video claiming that three other hostages, including an American, were killed in the bombardment, but it provided no evidence. The army said it does ""not respond to statements by terrorist organizations.” Hamas and other militants are still holding some 120 hostages, around a third of whom are believed to have died. Hagari acknowledged that a cease-fire deal would bring home more hostages than military operations, but said Israeli forces need to “create conditions” to bring them home. “We are doing things that are unimaginable, and we will keep on doing things that are unimagined,” he said. ___ Jeffery reported from Jerusalem and Chehayeb from Beirut.

35,Anna Gordon,Ukraine’s Top Reconstruction Official Quits in Latest Blow for President Zelensky,https://time.com/6987078/ukraine-reconstruction-nayyem-resigns/,Mustafa Nayyem's resignation on Monday is the latest blow to the Zelensky government in recent months.,2024-06-10T13:07:41Z,"Mustafa Nayyem, the top official overseeing Ukraine’s defense fortifications and reconstruction efforts, announced his resignation on Monday. The news marks the latest high-profile departure that has shaken Western confidence in Ukraine’s government. Nayyem, who resigned alongside two other officials in Ukraine’s Restoration and Infrastructure Development agency, claimed his work was being undermined by the government.  Nayyem told the Financial Times that prior to his resignation, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal prohibited him from attending the annual Ukraine Recovery Conference on June 11 and 12 in Berlin. The conference brings together potential donors interested in funding reconstruction projects in parts of Ukraine where infrastructure has been damaged by the war.  Zelensky is expected to attend the conference and deliver a speech addressing the German parliament while he is there.  In his resignation letter, Nayyem said that he had faced “systemic obstacles” that made it difficult for him to use his powers effectively, according to the Financial Times.  Nayyem’s resignation raises new questions about reconstruction efforts and the ability to protect critical infrastructure amid the ongoing war. Last month, Ukraine’s minister of infrastructure and deputy prime minister of reconstruction Oleksandr Kubrakov was removed from office following a vote by the Ukrainian parliament. In recent months, Ukraine’s government has faced a series of personnel challenges. In March, Zelensky dismissed top aid Serhiy Shefir, from his role of first assistant, along with three advisers and two presidential representatives.

36,COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER / AP,President Offers Love and Pride for His Son’s Addiction Recovery after Guilty Verdict,https://time.com/6987508/president-offers-support-hunter-guilty-verdict/,"“Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Biden wrote after Hunter's guilty verdict.",2024-06-11T18:11:44Z,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden kept his distance from the courtroom where his son Hunter stood trial on felony gun charges to avoid any appearance of meddling but his quick statement reacting to the jury’s guilty verdict Tuesday spoke to where his heart has been all along. “Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Biden wrote. “So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.” After the verdict was announced, the White House canceled press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre’s scheduled briefing and announced that Biden would spend the evening in Delaware. Biden aides and allies have privately worried about the toll a guilty verdict would take on the 81-year-old president, for whom personal loss has been closely intertwined with his public life. They say the president is less worried about any personal political cost he might incur, than concerned as a father for a son who is only a few years removed from the throes of severe drug addiction. The verdict came shortly before the president was scheduled to give a speech on his administration’s efforts to limit gun violence and toughen enforcement of gun laws at a conference hosted by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund in Washington. From there, Biden is traveling to his Delaware home on Tuesday afternoon, where he was expected to gather with his family, including Hunter, before departing for Italy on Wednesday morning to attend the Group of Seven summit. Biden spent more time than usual in Wilmington while the trial was under way, part of a family show of support for Hunter. First lady Jill Biden was in the courtroom nearly every day — and made a 24-hour commute back from France to be there for testimony on Friday — but she just missed being there when the verdict came down on Tuesday. She arrived back to the courthouse just minutes after the foreperson three times intoned “guilty."" A collection of other family members were there throughout the trial. The president himself did not attend court, but was closely following the proceedings, with updates often coming from the first lady. Yet, every day as Hunter arrived to the courthouse, he passed a portrait of his father hanging on the wall as he walked through the doors. Hunter Biden, in his own statement, like his father spoke to family ties and the process of recovery. “I am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends, and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,"" Hunter Biden said in a statement, mentioning his wife first. ""Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time.” The trial was a highly personal tour of Hunter Biden's drug use and mistakes. Jurors listened to hours of testimony from Hunter Biden's ex-wife, a former girlfriend and his brother’s widow, who between them painted a picture of strip club trips, infidelity, habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. Jurors saw images of the president’s son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room and half-naked holding crack pipes. And they watched a video of his crack cocaine being weighed on a scale. Prosecutors argued the evidence was necessary to prove to jurors that the 54-year-old was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun, and therefore lied on a gun-purchase form when he said he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs. “The evidence was personal. It was ugly, and it was overwhelming,” prosecutor Leo Wise argued. “It was also absolutely necessary.” Wise encouraged jurors during deliberations to weigh the evidence. Then he swept his hand across the room, directing them to look at the gallery and the clutch of Biden family members seated in courtroom. “All of this is not evidence,” he said. “People sitting in the gallery are not evidence.” Even Republican critics acknowledged the pain for the Biden family. “Anybody who has a child, I have children of my own, anybody who has children, this is devastating to them,” said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa."
37,Geoffrey Bunting,The Atypical Family‘s Finale Almost Rises Above Its Mean-Spirited Script,https://time.com/6987430/the-atypical-family-finale-netflix/,"The Netflix K-drama follows a family that has lost its superpowers, and a host of storylines involving familial conflict, bullying, scandals, and grief.",2024-06-12T14:34:16Z,"The first time we meet the Boks in Netflix’s The Atypical Family, they are perched on a literal precipice. Bok Dong-hee (Soo-hyun) stands on the edge of a cliff, willing herself to fly. Her brother, Gwi-ju (Jang Ki-young), downs a stiff drink while his mother, Man-heum (Ko Do-shim) simultaneously berates him for no longer being able to travel back in time and laments the insomnia that stops her dreaming of the future. It’s an unsubtle introduction to the series’ titular atypical family, now rendered ordinary by the loss of their superpowers and desperate to get them back. And it’s a lack of subtlety that haunts The Atypical Family right to its surprisingly watchable end. That ending arrived this weekend, when the series' 12th and final episode aired on Netflix. The finale closed with a tight, almost-tragic climax that had the potential to salvage a sterile series that too often relied on mean-spirited jokes and tried to cram too much into its runtime. Yet, as The Atypical Family undermined its own grim final act with a typical K-drama happy ending, it failed to redeem its many shortcomings. Read more: Queen of Tears Is Yet Another K-Drama That Doesn’t Stick the Landing If the story of a matriarch fretting over her family’s loss of superpowers draws immediate comparisons to Disney’s Encanto, the similarities continue when it falls to a young, non-superpowered woman, Do Da-hae (Chun Woo-hee), to help the Boks rediscover their humanity. Da-hae enters the picture after Gwi-ju falls from the cliff and she drags him from the water, only to promptly disappear again. In a moment of ostensible serendipity, Man-heum finds her working at a spa seemingly hours later, where she discovers Da-hae is the only person who can grant her the sleep she desperately needs. Da-hae is immediately ushered into the Bok family home and just as quickly thrust on Gwi-ju—who is still grieving the loss of his first wife by drinking and neglecting his daughter, I-na (Park So-yi). Yet, as Da-hae pretends to be receptive in furtherance of what will turn out to be not serendipity but in fact an elaborate scam, so too does she begin to discover the Boks’ superpowered secret. As far as supernatural thrillers go, it’s an interesting setup. The Atypical Family founders, however, under the weight of its moving parts. The series is forever in a rush as it uses its superhero framework to explore familial conflict, school bullying, the many scams of Da-hae’s guardian Baek Il-hong (Kim Keum-soon), cheating scandals, and grief—to name only a few of its themes and storylines. Even in a South Korean TV landscape renowned for blending genres, it’s too much to balance. An uncharitable read may be that the show is simply trying to emulate the success of the 2023 Hulu series Moving. But while that superpowered show offered a compassionate glimpse into the fringes of South Korean society, The Atypical Family loses its way, more often than not, in a script from writer Joo Hwa-mi that brutally punches down on any character that falls outside the narrowly airbrushed ideals of the prototypical K-drama. This cruelty, which eventually extends to insensitivity around poverty, abuse, and bullying, is exemplified in the characterization of Dong-hee. The decision to place a slender actress in a fat suit in 2024 is absurd on its face—though The Atypical Family is not the only recent series to do so. Joo, however, takes every opportunity to make Dong-hee as repellent as possible. Never far from a bag of chips, she screams when a snack is struck from her hands and scrabbles after it like Garfield pouncing on a lasagne. When an al fresco dinner is ruined by rain, she yells at her father (Oh Man-seok) to save the food. She even falls for someone solely based on how they deliver food to her—though Joo only allows this after she loses weight. That weight loss is achieved through a combination of starving herself and overexercising. These unhealthy methods are rarely, and only limply, challenged, and ultimately celebrated. It’s a strikingly cruel depiction, but it is only part of the unkindness at the core of The Atypical Family’s script. Read more: The Netflix Korean Dramas to Look Out for in 2024 The script deals with addiction in several of the characters’ arcs, though it squanders any potential to do so thoughtfully and sensitively. Gwi-ju is an alcoholic addicted to revisiting the past; Dong-hee is addicted to food; Man-heum is addicted to power to the point of abuse. Yet, as Joo plays with complex and sensitive issues, her writing betrays such a poor understanding of addiction—and such a low opinion of addicts—that it ultimately revels in unkind and often dangerous depictions. Even as The Atypical Family performs compassion—through, for instance, momentary understanding of Gwi-ju’s grief or I-na receiving attention from her father (before he returns to neglecting her)—time and again these moments are undermined with shallow or insincere storytelling. So invested is the script in execrating the perceived weakness of its characters, that it leaves them bereft of development. This isn’t helped by the lack of chemistry between the two leads—and note should be made of how impressively uncharismatic Jang is as Gwi-ju. So, even as the series reaches its emotional climax, we still don’t understand why Gwi-ju and Da-hae would fall for each other beyond the script—and K-drama tradition—dictating that it be so. Chun Woo-hee, as Da-hae, gives a determined performance, even if the material she’s working with ultimately renders it lackluster. She is responsible for some of The Atypical Family’s lighter moments, albeit unintentionally. Gwi-ju is invisible when he visits the past, forcing Chun to awkwardly lean while ostensibly in his arms or appear to be bickering with herself. The result is a secondhand embarrassment for Chun, whose early turns in The Wailing and Argon show she deserves better than these laughable scenes. Which contributes to what is perhaps most jarring about The Atypical Family. Despite its many faults, The Atypical Family is surprisingly, even atypically, watchable. In spite of its script, The Atypical Family is a terrifically well-made series. In production, design, sound, editing—it’s excellent. And there was certainly potential in its conception. Any one of its many plotlines could make for an excellent K-drama. A woman tries to scam a rich heir only for him to provide a way out of her own dreadful situation, someone traveling back in time but unable to avert a disaster (a plot that tows awfully close to this year’s Marry My Husband), a teen overcoming bullying through dance. The problem is that a show cannot survive on ideas and production alone—it demands solid writing. Joo appears aware of the show’s overstuffed story when The Atypical Family shears most of its subplots to focus on Gwi-ju’s time-travel and its consequences in the series’ final few hours. But by then, it’s too late. Any emotional heft The Atypical Family wields in these last moments is unearned, these characters so undercooked, that it means nothing when Gwi-ju and Da-hae frolic in romantic bliss or when tragic reality filters in. There is no resolution of season-long plotlines, just new ones injected at the last minute as a tear-jerking cap on an otherwise impotent series. While occasionally diverting, The Atypical Family is a dispiriting trudge through the worst elements of South Korean TV: lazy stereotypes, cookie-cutter plots, and a cruelty that clearly resonates with audiences who have kept The Atypical Family in Netflix’s Top 10 non-English series throughout its run. Though its tight production at times obscures its problematic writing, the series cannot outpace its mean-spirited script even at its most engaging—invariably its most quiet moments. It is apt, perhaps, as a series with nothing positive to say, that The Atypical Family is at its most watchable when nobody is talking."

HANNON / AP,Sacramento Mass Shooting Suspect Dies in Jail,https://time.com/6986981/sacramento-mass-shooting-suspect-dies-jail/,The 29-year-old male inmate died while in custody at the Sacramento County Main Jail on Saturday morning.,2024-06-09T16:44:12Z,"A suspect who was being held in a California jail on charges connected to a 2022 mass shooting in the state capital died in his cell Saturday, according to police and his attorney. The 29-year-old male inmate died while in custody at the Sacramento County Main Jail around 2:15 a.m., the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement posted on social media. The San Francisco Chronicle reported public defender Norman Dawson identified the man as Smiley Martin, his client who was awaiting trial on three felony charges stemming from an April 3, 2022, shooting in Sacramento that killed six people and wounded 12 others, including two of the alleged shooters. Jail deputies were conducting a cell check and found an unresponsive inmate. The deputies and then fire department personnel attempted life-saving procedures but he was pronounced dead, the sheriff's office said. The Sacramento County Coroner’s Office will determine the cause of death and release the man's name after notification of his next of kin, according to the sheriff's office, which said it will investigate. Martin was “fighting to defend his innocence in the preliminary hearing process"" at the time of his death, Dawson said in a written statement. More than 100 shots were fired in rapid-fire succession in a downtown entertainment area near the state Capitol building during the shooting around 2 a.m. Two groups of men connected to gangs began shooting as bars and clubs emptied out at closing time, sending hundreds of people desperately trying to reach safety. At least five gunmen were involved, police said. Martin, who was 27 at the time, was arrested while hospitalized with gunshot wounds. He was charged with murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession and transport of a machine gun. Authorities also arrested his brother, Dandrae Martin, 26 at the time, as a “related suspect” on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and being a convict carrying a loaded gun. He suffered minor wounds. Dandrae Martin posted a live video of himself with a handgun hours before the shooting, a law enforcement official said. A third man, Mtula Payton, also was charged in connection with the shooting."
39,Philip Lymbery and Leticia Carvalho,Penguins Are Key Indicators of the Ocean’s Health,https://time.com/6986218/penguins-oceans-health-essay/,The plight of penguins can serve as a guidepost for what needs to happen if we are to preserve life on both land and sea.,2024-06-07T11:00:00Z,"In Betty’s Bay, South Africa, one of the world’s wildlife celebrities, an African penguin, was busy shaking herself free from the sea. On land, cute and ungainly in equal measure, this princess of the ocean had a glint in her eye. It was late April during peak breeding season. She hurried toward rocks and scrub bed beyond the tideline. Here, she would disappear momentarily beneath a meandering boardwalk built for admiring tourists before emerging on the other side. Lining the margin of the sandy beach were rows of white nesting shelters and, in one of them, her mate. Nearby, a conservationist was proudly pointing out a new walkway designed by scientists with penguins in mind. These flightless birds were now using it as their preferred route under the boardwalk and out to sea. Cunningly, it would lead them over a state-of-the-art weighbridge telling scientists how successful these dapper little birds had been at fishing. African penguins spend a lot of time at sea catching fish. When times are good, they can gain a third of their body weight in a day. When fishing is bad, they lose weight and may abandon attempts to breed. Read More: How to Help The Fishing Industry? Stop Fishing So Much So, how were they doing? Well, not good. The penguins’ staple prey of sardines and anchovies are being pulled out of the ocean in great quantities for animal feed. Much of the fish are to be ground down into fishmeal for the feed troughs of industrially reared pigs, poultry, and fish. Declining fish stocks mean that penguins are finding it harder to find enough food for their chicks, putting further pressure on a species in drastic decline. Latest projections show this iconic species could be extinct in the wild by 2035. Having once numbered in their millions, African penguins have since declined by 97% in little more than a century. The impact of their decline will be felt close to home, not least for the local economy. Renowned for pulling a crowd, the tourist revenue at a similar penguin colony at Boulders Beach, Cape Town has been estimated at over 300 million rand ($16 million) a year. This unfolding ecological disaster also points to much broader concern for the environment, with penguins being seen as a key indicator of the wider ecological health of our ocean. Their plight could well be the canary in the coal mine for what needs to happen if we are to preserve life on both land and sea. The ocean is our planet’s life support and is what regulates the global climate system. It is the world’s largest ecosystem, home to nearly a million known species and containing vast untapped potential for scientific discovery. Despite our utter reliance on it, we have only ever explored about 10% of it. While we know little of the ocean compared to its immense vastness, what we do know is that the consequences of our actions are evident throughout its waters. As the plight of the penguins shows, a classic interdependence between land and sea is the way we produce food. Recent decades have seen the uptick of industrial agriculture often associated with heavy use of artificial fertilizers, chemical pesticides, and poor animal welfare. Farmed animals have essentially been taken from pastures and reared in confinement, causing big impacts on both the welfare of farmed animals and the environment. Fertilizers are a big source of pollution in the ocean, leading to over 500 dead zones, areas of sea where nothing lives. Large amounts of commercial fertiliser containing the “Big 3” primary nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K), and manure are applied to soils. Excess nutrients then wash into rivers and streams and end up in the sea, killing fish and other aquatic life needed by the wider ecosystem, including seabirds like penguins. Scientists now fear that the amount of nitrogen pollution emitted just by global animal farming is more than the planet can cope with. Aimable Uwizeye of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization found that animal farming accounts for about a third of all humanity’s nitrogen emissions. Of this, 68% of emissions are attributable to crops grown to feed animals, followed by nitrogen released by the build-up and management of manure. This further exacerbates the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and the proliferation of pollution and waste. This crisis is placing the world’s ecosystems under assault. Billions of hectares of land are degraded, affecting almost half of the world’s population and threatening half of global GDP. Rural communities, smallholder farmers and the extremely poor are hit hardest. The way we produce and consume food is driving over 80 % of biodiversity loss.  Pollution from land-based sources and overfishing for animal feed is impacting species in Africa and other parts of the world much as it is impacting the penguins of Betty’s Bay. Penguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 penguin species listed as either Vulnerable or Endangered. But land restoration can reverse the creeping tide of degradation, drought and desertification. Restoration boosts livelihoods, lowers poverty and builds resilience to extreme weather. Restoration increases carbon storage and slows climate change. Restoring just 15% of land and halting further conversion could avoid up to 60% of expected species extinctions. We cannot turn back time, but we can grow forests, green our cities, fish sustainably, harvest rainwater, and eat nature-friendly, higher welfare foods. Governments and the finance sector can promote regenerative, nature-friendly farming to increase food production while preserving ecosystems. Agricultural, forestry and fishing subsidies can be redirected towards sustainable practices and small-scale farmers. Farming can be encouraged to use sustainable farming practices that don’t rely on heavy chemical inputs and animal feed. Farmed animals can be returned to the land as part of balanced, rotational, mixed agricultural practices that adhere to nature-friendly, animal welfare and agro-ecological principles. Consumers, in turn, can help by choosing foods that help build a better, more sustainable future. It’s only in this way that we can be the generation that finally makes peace with land and sea. And in this way, ensure a better future for the likes of Betty’s Bay’s penguins, people, and all other life on Earth."

The section that connects to the beach in Gaza, the causeway, was rebuilt nearly two weeks after heavy storms damaged it and abruptly halted what had already been a troubled delivery route. “Earlier this morning in Gaza, U.S. forces successfully attached the temporary pier to the Gaza beach,” Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters by phone Friday. “We expect to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance from the sea in the coming days.” Cooper said operations at the reconnected pier will be ramped up soon with a goal to get 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of food and other supplies moving through the pier into Gaza every two days. The pier was only operational for a week before a storm broke it apart, and had initially struggled to reach delivery goals. Weather was a factor, and early efforts to get aid from the pier into Gaza were disrupted as civilians desperate for food stormed the trucks that aid agencies were using to transport the food to the warehouses for distribution. However before it broke apart the pier had been gradually increasing aid movement each day. Cooper said Friday that the lessons learned from that initial week of operations made him confident higher levels of aid throughout could be attained now. A large section of the causeway broke apart May 25 as heavy winds and high seas hit the area, and four Army vessels operating there went aground, injuring three service members, including one who remains in critical condition. The damage was the latest stumbling block in what has been a persistent struggle to get food to starving Palestinians during the nearly 8-month-old Israel-Hamas war. The maritime route for a limited time had been an additional way to help get more aid into Gaza because the Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafahhas made it difficult, if not impossible at times, to get anything through land routes that are far more productive. Israel's Rafah military operations and military strikes in northern Gaza had also temporarily halted U.S. airdrops of food. Cooper said Friday the U.S. also expects to resume those airdrops in the coming days. President Joe Biden's administration has said from the start that the pier wasn’t meant to be a total solution and that any amount of aid helps. After the May 25 storm damage to the causeway, large sections were disconnected and moved to the Israeli port for repairs. In addition, two of the U.S. Army boats that went aground during the same bad weather near Ashkelon in Israel have been freed. Two other Army boats two beached onto the Gaza shoreline took on a lot of water and sand and the Israeli Navy has been helping with the repairs, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. Biden, a Democrat, announced his plan for the U.S. military to build a pier during his State of the Union address in early March, and the military said it would take about 60 days to get it installed and operational. The initial cost was estimated at $320 million, but Singh said earlier this week that the price had dropped to $230 million, due to contributions from Britain and because the cost of contracting trucks and other equipment was less than expected. It took a bit longer than the planned two months for installation, with the first trucks carrying aid for the Gaza Strip rolling down the pier on May 17. Just a day later, crowds overran a convoy of trucks as they headed into Gaza, stripping the cargo from 11 of the 16 vehicles before they reached a U.N. warehouse. The next day, as officials altered the travel routes of the convoys, aid finally began reaching people in need. More than 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of aid were delivered before the causeway broke apart in the storm, Pentagon officials said."

While U.S. audiences may, at present, be unfamiliar with Mountbatten, that looks set to change. Ahead of his debut on The Traitors, here’s what you need to know about the British aristocrat.  Mountbatten’s family tree and that of the Windsors are very closely related. Mountbatten’s father, David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven, was first cousin of Prince Philip. Mountbatten is a direct descendent of Queen Victoria and third cousin once-removed of Queen Elizabeth II. He is also the great-nephew of Louis Mountbatten, who was the last Viceroy of India, and was killed when the Irish Republican Army detonated a bomb on board his boat in August 1979. Mountbatten is one of the godparents of Lady Louise Windsor, daughter of King Charles’ brother Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. In 1994, Mountbatten married Penny Thompson, British philanthropist and businesswoman. The ceremony was attended by Princess Margaret and Prince Edward. Mountbatten and Thompson went on to have  three daughters together— Ella, Alix, and Luli. The couple separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. Mountbatten made headlines in 2016 by being the first person in the extended British Royal Family to come out as gay. He opened up about his decision to go public in an interview with the Daily Mail, and in 2018 he married his now-husband James Coyle, who is an airline cabin services director. A post shared by Ivar (@ivar_mountbatten) According to an interview Mountbatten and Coyle did with Tatler in 2019, Mountbatten had always known he wasn’t straight, but was not sure he would ever want to come out after his divorce. But all that changed when he met Coyle in 2015 in the Farinet bar in Verbier, Switzerland. “[Ivar] doesn't hang around,” Coyle said of his husband. “And that's the delightful thing about Ivar, he makes his mind up about some­thing and sticks to it. There's no game-playing, to a degree where you're almost looking for the catch. He's so straightforward and remarkably easy to love.” The two were married at their home in Bridwell Park, and Mountbatten told Tatler that he was walked down the aisle by ex-wife Thompson, and that though no royal family members were in attendance at his second wedding in 2018, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh gave their warm wishes to the couple.  “They're very support­ive and think James is brilliant,” said Mountbatten. According to Company Check, Mountbatten’s current total business assets are valued at £838k.  Previously, Mountbatten  worked as a geologist and as director of the SCL Group, which was a British behavioral research and strategic communication company, which closed operations due to the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal.Mountbatten and Coyle’s country house estate Bridwell Park, located in Devon, southwest England, is now open to the public and can be reserved for weddings and large events. In 2020, the couple opened the Orangery Cafe at the estate. The Queer Spirit Festival, which includes DJ’s, workshops, and group ceremonies related to queer spirituality, is also set to take place at Bridwell Park in August. This is not Mountbatten’s first foray into the world of reality television. He was on Keeping Up With The Aristocrats in 2022 and the 2019 season of the U.K. Channel 4 survival-based program Treasure Island with Bear Grylls, though he called his decision to go on the show a part of his “on-going midlife crises.”"
42,DAVID KOENIG / AP,"Southwest Airlines Plane Suffered Damage When It Went Into a ‘Dutch Roll’ During Flight, Investigators Say",https://time.com/6988973/southwest-airline-flight-dutch-roll-investigators/,A Boeing 737 Max suffered damage to parts of its structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a Southwest Airlines flight last month.,2024-06-14T22:51:08Z,"A Boeing 737 Max suffered damage to parts of the plane's structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a Southwest Airlines flight last month, U.S. investigators said Friday. The incident happened as the jet cruised at 34,000 feet from Phoenix to Oakland, California, on May 25, but Southwest did not notify the National Transportation Safety Board about the roll or damage to the jetliner until June 7, the NTSB said. “Following the event, SWA performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components,” the safety board said. The NTSB comment could suggest that the incident was more serious than previously known, but aviation experts said it was too soon to know for sure. A Dutch roll is a combination of yaw, or the tail sliding side to side, and the plane rocking in a way that causes the wings to roll up and down. The name comes from the way the rhythmic, swaying movement resembles a form of ice skating that was popular in the Netherlands. “It's just a part of aerodynamics,” said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now an aviation-safety consultant. “What you feel in the back is that the airplane sort of wallows.” Pilots train to recover from a Dutch roll, and most modern planes include a device called a yaw damper that can correct the condition by adjusting the rudder. A preliminary report by the Federal Aviation Administration said that after the Southwest plane landed, damage was discovered to a unit that controls backup power to the rudder. The damage was described as “substantial.” Cox said the structural damage likely occurred in the plane's tail fin, where the power units are housed. He was baffled that the backup unit would be damaged because normally it would not be activated during a Dutch roll. Cox said the two-way oscillation of a Dutch roll was a dangerous phenomenon in previous Boeing jets, but not in 737s because of design changes. Boeing “737s are not prone to excessive Dutch roll. The design of the airplane is (such that) if you do absolutely nothing, the airplane will dampen the Dutch roll out naturally,” he said. “In older-model airplanes — 707s, 727s — it could develop up to the point you could lose control of the airplane.” The NTSB said it downloaded data from the plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, which will help investigators determine the length and severity of the incident. Investigators won't know precisely what the pilots were saying, however: The cockpit voice recorder was overwritten after two hours. The pilots regained control and landed at Oakland. There were no reported injuries on the flight, which carried 175 passengers and a crew of six. The NTSB said it expected to issue a preliminary report on the incident in about 30 days."

Coli Found in Paris’ Seine River Less Than 60 Days Before Olympics,https://time.com/6988977/unsafe-e-coli-paris-seine-river-olympics/,Water in the Seine River had unsafe levels of E. coli less than two months before swimming competitions are scheduled to take place in it.,2024-06-14T23:04:00Z,"Paris — Water in the Seine River had unsafe elevated levels of E. coli less than two months before swimming competitions are scheduled to take place in it during the Paris Olympics, according to test results published Friday. Contamination levels in the first eight days of June, after persistent heavy rain in Paris, showed bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci beyond limits judged safe for athletes. The report was published by monitoring group Eau de Paris one day after a senior International Olympic Committee executive said there were “no reasons to doubt” races will go ahead as scheduled in in a historic downtown stretch of the Seine near the Eiffel Tower. The first Olympic event in the cleaned-up Seine is men’s triathlon, including a 1.5-kilometer (under 1 mile) swim, on the morning of July 30. The women’s triathlon is the next day and a mixed relay event is on Aug. 5. Marathon swimming races over 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) for women and men are scheduled on Aug. 8 and 9, respectively, in waters that were historically polluted before a $1.5 billion investment ahead of the Olympics “We are confident that we will swim in the Seine this summer,” IOC official Christophe Dubi said Thursday at an online briefing after hearing an update Paris from city officials and Olympic organizers. Despite the IOC’s publicly expressed confidence, the final decision on approving the events safe for athletes should rest with the governing bodies of individual sports, World Aquatics and World Triathlon. The safety of the Seine water for the Olympics has been in doubt since some test events scheduled last August were cancelled, also after unseasonal heavy rains. According to European standards, the safe limit for E. coli is 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters. The World Triathlon Federation uses the same criteria to determine sufficient water quality for competitions. During the first eight days of June, test results showed that E. coli levels frequently exceeded these thresholds. Enterococci levels were better, mostly staying within safe limits. The tests indicated an improvement, from high contamination levels on June 1 to more acceptable levels by June 9, mainly due to improved weather. Rainwater infiltrates the sewer system, and to prevent street flooding, the excess water, carrying fecal bacteria, is diverted into the Seine. To address this, a massive reservoir capable of storing 50,000 cubic meters of water during heavy rainfall was inaugurated in May. Water quality of rivers in major cities can be impacted by many things, from runoff to dumping of chemicals, sometimes illegally, and boat traffic. Earlier this week, Paris’ mayor Anne Hidalgo doubled down on her promise to take a dip in the river before the start of the competition. On Tuesday, she confirmed that her swim was postponed until after the snap elections in France, which end on July 7."
44,Alice Park,Can Bird Flu Survive in Milk?,https://time.com/6988603/bird-flu-milk-pasteurization/,Researchers tested infected milk at commonly used pasteurization temperatures.,2024-06-14T20:22:15Z,"Now that avian influenza is circulating among dairy cattle in at least 12 states in the U.S. and has infected three dairy workers, health experts are keeping a close eye on whether people can be infected from consuming infected milk or meat. So far, the federal government maintains that the risk of getting infected is low for the general public, and that commercially sold milk remains safe to drink. That’s despite the fact that U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that about 20% of milk sold in stores contains fragments of the bird flu virus H5N1. Those fragments so far are not active, however; researchers report that they could not generate any live virus from them in the lab, and animals exposed to them did not develop infections. Both agencies also say that pasteurization, or heating milk, inactivates the virus. But the timing of the pasteurization and the amount of virus in the milk before it's treated are important to understanding how effective heat-treating can be.  In a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the University of California, Los Angeles wanted to better understand how well the process can inactivate H5N1. They tested raw milk treated at two different temperatures—63°C (145°F) and 72°C (161°F)—which are typically used to pasteurize milk for retail markets. Read More: We Are Not Safe from Bird Flu Until We Protect Farmworkers The good news is that at the lower temperature, heat inactivated the virus in raw milk within two minutes—which means that commercial pasteurization, which generally heats milk to 63°C for 30 minutes, should be sufficient to inactivate H5N1. At the higher temperature, the virus was inactivated in most cases after just 20 seconds. “When we did this study, there was no information on H5N1 in milk because it had never been observed before, so our starting point was building information on how well these viruses get inactivated by pasteurization,” says Vincent Munster, chief of virus ecology in the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “This is the first study looking at the stability as well as inactivation and efficiency of heat treatment of H5N1 in the lab setting.” While the findings are reassuring that conditions mimicking commercial pasteurization can effectively kill H5N1, the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture are conducting studies to verify that real-world milk treatment processes do indeed inactivate H5N1. Munster notes, for example, that the effectiveness of pasteurization is both time and dose dependent, meaning the milk needs to be treated for a specific amount of time, and that milk containing higher concentrations of virus may require longer heat exposure to kill all of the virus. Pasteurization facilities often treat milk from farms in multiple states, so batches may have varying amounts of virus. Treating them at the same temperatures for the same amount of time may not always inactivate all of the virus present, if the milk contains a high concentration of H5N1. “The next step is to confirm that industrial-scale pasteurization works the way it is supposed to work,” he says. For now, it’s important to continue learning more about what happens to the virus as it moves from an infected dairy cow and into the milk supply. “Even with very efficient inactivation, H5N1 should not be in our milk,” says Munster. “So we should make an effort to ramp up our countermeasures to prevent H5N1-positive milk from entering dairy processing plants. If we don’t have H5N1 in the milk, we won’t have to inactivate it.”"

The victims' families have been invited to watch the first blows and hammer off a piece themselves if they choose. Officials plan to complete the weekslong project before the school’s 3,300 students return in August from summer vacation. Most were in elementary school when the shooting happened. The building had been kept up to serve as evidence at the shooter's 2022 penalty trial. Jurors toured its bullet-pocked and blood-stained halls, but spared him a death sentence. He is serving a term of life without parole. Broward County is not alone in taking down a school building after a mass shooting. In Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary School was torn down after the 2012 shooting and replaced. In Texas, officials closed Robb Elementary in Uvalde after the 2022 shooting there and plan to demolish it. Colorado’s Columbine High had its library demolished after the 1999 shooting. Over the last year, some victims' relatives have led Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Congress, school officials, police officers and about 500 other invitees from around the country on tours of the building. They mostly demonstrated how improved safety measures like bullet-resistant glass in door windows, a better alarm system and doors that lock from the inside could have saved lives. Those who have taken the tour have called it gut-wrenching as something of a time capsule of Feb. 14, 2018. Textbooks and laptops sat open on desks, and wilted Valentine’s Day flowers, deflated balloons and abandoned teddy bears were scattered amid broken glass. Those objects have now been removed. The Broward County school board has not decided what the building will be replaced with. Teachers suggested a practice field for the band, Junior ROTC and other groups, connected by a landscaped pathway to a nearby memorial that was erected a few years ago. Several of the students killed belonged to the band or Junior ROTC. Some parents want the site turned into a memorial."

From how to watch to who is nominated, here's what you need to know.",2024-06-16T12:16:37Z,"The biggest night of the year for Broadway stars and fans is upon us. June 16 marks the 77th Tony Awards, celebrating the best and brightest of this year on Broadway. With 28 of the 36 shows catching at least one nomination, a highly contested Best Musical category, and nine musical performances, this year’s show is sure to excite viewers. The guestlist is star-studded, with the presenters alone proving to be an impressive list. Tony Award-winners Cynthia Erivo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Idina Menzel, Jeffrey Wright, and Ben Platt will hand out awards, as well as Josh Gad, Andrew Rannells, and Anthony Ramos. From how to watch to who is nominated, here’s what you need to know about this year’s celebration of talent, art, and theater: This year, the Tony Awards will be held at the David H. Koch Theater, the home to the New York City Ballet in Lincoln Center.  The three-hour main telecast will air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ with Showtime from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. EST for U.S. audiences.  There will also be a pre-show on Pluto TV,  hosted by dancer and presenter Julianne Hough and actor/rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar, where more technical Tony Awards will be awarded. This year’s host is Ariana DeBose, known for her Oscar-winning performance in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story, making history as the first Afro Latina and openly queer actor of color to win an acting Oscar. She was also in the original cast of Lin Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton, and in 2018 she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her breakout performance in Summer: The Donna Summer Musical. This will be her third time hosting. “This is Broadway’s biggest night. Why not give the people at home even more of a Broadway experience?” DeBose told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Our show is going to move like a Broadway show. We want to give you a full Broadway experience.” The cast of the nominated dance-musical Illinoise, based on the music of singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, and of Suffs, a musical about the suffragette movement produced by Hillary Clinton, are set to perform during the awards. They will be joined by performances by the casts of of Stereophonic, Hell’s Kitchen, Cabaret, Merrily We Roll Along, The Outsiders, The Who’s Tommy, and Water For Elephants. Nicole Scherzinger will also perform for the “In Memoriam” segment, where fans may see tributes to Broadway stars such as Ron Simons, Tony Mordente, and Chita Rivera. A total of 28 shows earned at least one Tony nomination nod, led by the musical Hell's Kitchen, powered with songs by Alicia Keys, and the play Stereophonic, composed by Will Butler of indie rock band Arcade Fire fame, each with 13 nominations respectively. In fact, five of Stereophonic’s seven performers were singled out for individual acting nominations.  The musical The Outsiders, an adaptation of the S. E. Hinton novel and the Francis Ford Coppola film, also earned 12 nominations; and the revival of the classic Cabaret, with British actor Eddie Redmayne at the helm, has nine nominations to its name.  After a star-studded few months on Broadway, the guestlist for this year’s Tony Awards looks strong. Rachel McAdams snagged a nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play for her Broadway debut in Mary Jane, as did Succession actor Jeremy Strong, who is up for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play on account of his work in Enemy of the People. Actors Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson also both received nominations for their roles in Mother Play and Appropriate respectively, as did Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame for his role in fan-favorite Merrily We Roll Along. Redmayne in his second show on Broadway got a nod as Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical as did actor Brian d'Arcy James for Days of Wine and Roses and Jonathan Groff in Merrily We Roll Along. There are also a record-breaking number of women nominated for best directing, holding seven of the 10 slots. In the category of Best Direction of a Play, Anne Kauffman, Lila Neugebauer and Whitney White are nominated for Mary Jane, Appropriate, and Jaja’s African Hair Braiding respectively, and in the category of Best Direction of a Musical, Maria Friedman, Leigh Silverman, Jessica Stone, and Danya Taymor are nominated for Merrily We Roll Along, Suffs, Water for Elephants, and The Outsiders respectively. Only 10 women have ever won Tony awards for directing. You can see the full list of Tony Awards 2024 nominees here."
47,Justin Worland,Consumers Don’t Buy Corporate Blame Shifting on Climate,https://time.com/6986626/consumers-individual-action-climate-change/,A new survey shows that consumers think companies have the most responsibility to tackle climate change,2024-06-07T15:29:35Z,"One of the most pervasive misunderstandings I hear in some corporate circles is that consumers really don’t care about climate change because, by and large, they aren’t willing to pay much to address it. To make this argument, skeptics of corporate climate action often point to the mounds of evidence showing that most consumers prioritize price over sustainability in their buying decisions. It is true—and unsurprising—that price remains the top concern for most consumers, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t care at all. Indeed, surveys suggest that consumers do care about climate change. They just don’t think it’s their responsibility to address it. In a recent poll asking who bears responsibility for climate change, respondents answered decisively: companies, first and foremost, are responsible. In the June 4 University of Chicago survey, 62% of respondents said that industry bears significant responsibility in cutting emissions. That’s followed closely by 59% who say the same about the federal government. (I am the journalism fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago). Another survey released earlier this year by the consulting firm EY found that two-thirds of American consumers think that they have already done enough to address climate change and that energy companies should take the lead in reducing energy consumption. An economics-minded reader might balk at the apparent contradiction in these findings. Companies can offer more climate friendly products in a range of industries right now without any further technological breakthroughs, but those costs would ultimately hit consumers in one way or another. In other words, consumers can’t have their cake and eat it, too. But the findings are nonetheless worth reflecting on. For one, they throw cold water on the long-running campaigns by some companies and industry groups aimed at convincing individuals to take responsibility for climate change. Despite decades of pushing that message, only 41% of respondents to the Chicago survey said individuals bear significant responsibility for addressing climate change. Extrapolate a little further, and the findings help make the case for companies to find ways to prioritize sustainability. For one, it’s worth noting that some consumers say they are willing to pay a sustainability premium, if only a small one. And behavioral economists have found that companies can effectively “ nudge"" consumers into greener choices—think of making the default option the more sustainable one. Even consumers who aren’t willing to pay a premium for sustainability right now may see a company’s green products as a differentiator when the cost comes down. In the long run, as more and more companies invest in sustainability efforts, sustainability metrics are likely to become less of a “nice-to-have” and more of a baseline for entry. Threading the cost and sustainability needle isn’t always easy, but it’s increasingly necessary.  To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here."

Southern Nevada Health District said in a press release Monday that as of June 6, 91 pools, comprising 3,081 mosquitoes from 16 ZIP codes, have tested positive for the virus. Two pools, comprising 46 mosquitoes from two ZIP codes, have also tested positive for the virus that causes St. Louis encephalitis. The health district’s Mosquito Surveillance Program has received an increased number of complaints from residents about mosquito activity, according to the press release. Health officials attributed the rise in reports partly to the increased presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the area—these mosquitoes are aggressive biters during the day and tend to bite people rather than birds. Aedes aegypti have tested positive for West Nile virus for the first time in Clark County, the press release said. For the past four years, Southern Nevada has had minimal West Nile virus activity, health officials said. Only two human cases of the virus were reported in 2023. In 2019, officials reported 43 confirmed human cases. Read More: Mosquito-Borne West Nile Virus Soared in 2018, According to CDC Data Humans can become infected with West Nile virus if they are bitten by a mosquito that is infected with the virus. About one in five people who are infected with West Nile virus will develop symptoms, such as fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash, according to the press release. In some cases—about one in 150 people—those who are infected with West Nile virus can develop a more serious, or even fatal, illness. The last time mosquitoes in Clark County tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus was in 2019, and there has not been a human case since 2016, according to the press release. Like West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, and although most people who are infected will not develop symptoms, some could develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Some people could develop a neuroinvasive form of the disease that causes either encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, which is inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, according to the press release. Health officials encouraged the public to take preventive steps to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses, including getting rid of standing water, which can be a breeding source for mosquitoes, as well as using insect repellent to prevent mosquito bites."

The early morning blaze broke out at around 4:10 a.m. local time and engulfed more than 100 pet shops in the famous market, according to Bangkok officials. Caged animals including dogs, birds, cats, and snakes were reportedly burned to death in their cages.  No human casualties have been reported as a result of the fire.  Officials have said it took emergency responders around an hour to gain control of the fire, which was reportedly caused by an electrical short circuit. While officials are still calculating the financial damage incurred by the fire, affected shop owners have been encouraged to register for compensation.  Chatuchak, like many markets in the Thai capital, is saturated with a variety of stores in its narrow lanes. The tourist hotspot boasts more than 15,000 stalls across 26 sections—including antiques, food, and clothing—and claims to attract 200,000 visitors at the weekend.  The pet section of the market is open throughout the week, and has frequently been criticized for its treatment of animals. Tuesday’s blaze invited renewed criticism from animal rights groups, including PETA.    “Animals are not ours to use for our entertainment,” PETA’s senior vice-president Jason Baker said on Tuesday, the BBC reported. “PETA urges the Thai government to ensure that this facility, where captive animals suffer, never reopens.”  The Wildlife Friends Foundation (WFFT) in Thailand used the fire to point to the illegal smuggling of rare and endangered species, a practice that is prevalent among pet vendors in Chatuchak.  “Chatuchak market is a shame on the city of Bangkok. It has been allowed to continue selling animals unethically and often illegally for far too long,” WFFT’s director Edwin Wiek said in a statement. He added that the sale of exotic animals in the market “is immoral, cruel, a health and safety hazard, and completely unnecessary."" "

The wedding of 33-year-old Grosvenor, one of Britain's wealthiest landowners, to his partner Olivia Henson, 31, is one of the high-society events of the year in Britain. William, 41, arrived with his fellow ushers at Chester Cathedral in northwest England ahead of the midday service. The venue is close to the duke’s 10,000-acre (4,000-hectare) Eaton Hall estate, where guests were due to attend a private wedding reception. Onlookers gathered outside the cathedral cheered the arrival of Grosvenor, dressed in a morning suit, and Henson, wearing a white wedding dress by British designer Emma Victoria Payne. Her long veil, worn over a tiara, rippled in the wind. Grosvenor is a godfather to 10-year-old Prince George, the eldest son of William and his wife Catherine. Kate, who is being treated for cancer, was not expected to attend the wedding. Neither was William’s estranged younger brother Prince Harry, who lives in California with his wife Meghan and their two children. Grosvenor inherited his title at the age of 25 when his father died in 2016. His ancestor, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, married heiress Mary Davies and acquired what was then marshland in 1677. Over the generations the family developed the land into two of London’s most affluent neighborhoods, Mayfair and Belgravia. The family’s Grosvenor Estate owns 300 acres (121 hectares)of land in London, as well as land across Britain and housing, office and retail space around the world. The 2024 Sunday Times Rich List estimated the duke’s wealth at just over 10 billion pounds ($12.8 billion.)"
51,Judy Berman,Julio Torres’ Fantasmas Is a Marvelous Manifesto for Keeping TV Weird,https://time.com/6986387/fantasmas-review-julio-torres/,The visionary 'Los Espookys' creator and 'SNL' alum returns to HBO with his oddest—and best—offering yet.,2024-06-07T12:00:00Z,"Quantity, not quality, defined the Peak TV era, an original-content bonanza that began when streaming services started making their own shows in the mid-2010s and was on the wane by the time Americans emerged from pandemic isolation. But the flurry of production inevitably facilitated some deeply strange—and often great—projects. Netflix let cult comedian Maria Bamford make Lady Dynamite, a surreal journey into her mental illness. Starz greenlighted New Queer Cinema legend Gregg Araki’s Now Apocalypse, which was kind of like Melrose Place if it had horny lizard aliens. SNL writer Julio Torres sold HBO on Los Espookys, a Spanish-language comedy about four friends who execute elaborate horror hoaxes for a living. Now Peak TV is over, the streaming industry is contracting, and executives have become increasingly conservative about the projects and voices in which they choose to invest their shrinking budgets. And yet, by some miracle, Torres is back on HBO, June 7, with his weirdest and most wonderful creation to date. Fantasmas (Spanish for ghosts) gets its title from a pitch writer and director Torres’ quasi-autobiographical protagonist Julio makes to Crayola, early in the six-episode series’ premiere, for a clear-colored crayon with that spectral name. But it applies equally to the show’s characters, offbeat dreamers set adrift in a society eager to commodify their identities and aspirations. The premise makes Fantasmas both a sparkling specimen of weird TV and a manifesto championing the existence of that possibly dying art. Here’s the best I can do for you in terms of a plot summary: Julio, a New Yorker who has been avoiding urgent letters from his landlord, purchases and then promptly loses a precious gold oyster earring that is the exact size and shape of a worrisome mole on the side of his face. It wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that the series follows his search for the missing bauble, with dubious help from his agent, Martine Gutierrez’s Vanesja (the S is silent, and Vanesja’s career is actually a years-long performance art project), and robot secretary, Bibo (voiced by Joe Rumrill), who is also an aspiring actor. Julio’s profession is nebulously creative. As a result of being struck by lightning as a child, he explains, “I can feel the inner lives of shapes and colors and sounds and letters.” For example, Q, “which comes up way too early in the alphabet” and “should be all the way in the back with the fellow avant-garde letters: the X, the Y, the Z.” This monologue, delivered in the back of a Chester—which is like an Uber, except its namesake driver (Tomás Matos) is a genderqueer eccentric resisting corporate domination—gives way to what, in a more typical SNL-adjacent comedy, might be described as a sketch. Steve Buscemi appears as Q, an aggressive, experimental-punk musician who’s booked on a bill between accessible, crowd-pleasing normies P and R. The audience revolts. Q spirals into self-destruction. But then weirdness triumphs as a band comprising W, X, Y, and Z rises to fame and cites Q as a seminal influence. What seems to be a fanciful digression is really Fantasmas in miniature: an oddball hero’s journey that illustrates the cultural value of the brilliant bohemian. Such vignettes are the meat of the show, bound together by the connective tissue of Julio’s quest. Set in a New York whose look is equal parts Blade Runner, diorama art, and neon dreamscape, with Torres often zooming out to expose the constructedness of the sets, these stories take us on side quests with minor characters. Unwaveringly loyal to her employer, an insurance agency employee (Alexa Demie) who refuses to process Julio’s claim meets her sadomasochistic match in an airline’s customer service representative, played by Ziwe. Fantasmas is packed with bonkers TV parodies, from Bowen Yang as an elf suing Santa for unpaid labor to an alternate-universe Alf to a brain-breaking Real Housewives sendup starring Rachel Dratch, Rosie Perez, Cole Escola, and Emma Stone (an executive producer) in a Lisa Rinna wig. As you can see, guest stars run the gamut from Hollywood A-listers to underground icons: Julia Fox, Paul Dano, Natasha Lyonne, Amy Sedaris, Pose standout Dominique Jackson. Tilda Swinton, who starred in Torres’ recent movie Problemista, gives voice to a majestic toilet. Like Problemista, which applied its creator’s fantastical eye to the labyrinth of immigration and the gig economy that leeches off the young, broke, and creative, Fantasmas is preoccupied by the bureaucratic apparatus that seeks to not just standardize but monetize identity. If the show has a villain, it’s a surveillance-capitalist nightmare called Proof of Existence—a monolithic new form of identification that collects every imaginable variety of personal data, charges a monthly subscription fee, and is fast becoming a requirement for obtaining everything from employment to housing. Julio wants to opt out, but the effects on his livelihood could be devastating. His lack of Proof forces him to hustle, which could mean scrapping ideas like a tragedy about that time a dolphin died in Brooklyn’s polluted Gowanus Canal in favor of autobiographical oppression porn. “No metaphors,” Vanesja coaches her client. “Just big, sad speeches. Call it Gaytino.” People who loudly self-identify as weird can be tiresome; they’re often more affected than they are genuinely different. But Torres is the real thing—a visionary weirdo who delivers on the artistic, comedic, and political potential of outsider identity. What he’s resisting in, and through, Fantasmas is the reduction of diversity in art to a few boxes checked on a Proof of Existence application. Sure, he’s a gay Salvadorian American whose background has influenced his work. Yet his vital stats aren't what define his comedy. It’s a brain that anthropomorphizes the letter Q and invents “the first and only queer hamster nightclub in New York City” and craves “an emoji that is one of the spoons from Beauty and the Beast finally getting turned back into a human but then realizing he’s still a servant” (as Julio explains: “That’s for when you get a promotion at work”).  Representation matters is the dead-eyed refrain of the flacks who nag Julio to abandon his crazy flights of fancy and just make Gaytino already. It certainly does, as TV turns away from the Bamfords and the Arakis it briefly embraced, but not necessarily in the way they mean."

It will be a huge challenge legally because they will potentially have no appeals rights, but we will try to document what’s happened and do what we can.” Biden’s policy halts asylum claims at the border once apprehensions reach 2,500 per day—a number that’s already exceeded.  The usual asylum screening can restart once there is a daily average below 1,500 for seven days in a row, and an additional two weeks has passed. In addition to the asylum limit, the Biden Administration also directed that the minimum time asylum-seekers have to find consultation was reduced to four hours from 24 hours, a time frame that Toczylowski calls “laughably” short. Keren Zwick, litigation director at the National Immigrant Justice Center, is already preparing for the fight against the executive actions in court alongside the ACLU. The ACLU released a memo on June 4, soon after Biden signed the executive action, outlining their intent to challenge the order in court and stating, “It was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now.” Throughout 2018 and 2019, former President Donald Trump attempted to change asylum rules through multiple policy changes, including the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, and an asylum ban on those who passed through another country before reaching the U.S. In response to the asylum ban, The ACLU filed suit, arguing that the Trump Administration had violated the rules set in place by Congress on establishing a “safe third country,” which is an agreement established with the Immigration and Nationality Act which allows another country to process asylum claims instead of the U.S. In July 2020, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. blocked Trump’s asylum ban. Biden also took steps to end Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy when he took office. Zwick says that the real challenge is going to be finding plaintiffs for their lawsuit, which means finding people directly harmed by the rule. That’s going to be particularly difficult if those directly harmed by Biden’s executive action are swiftly deported from the United States with the shortened consultation period of four hours. She and her team are potentially going to have to search for people who have already been deported, traveling to their country of origin. “During the Trump Administration, we did have to go to Guatemala, so this isn't a new problem for us,” Zwick said. “It's just new that it's a Biden-related problem.” Trump’s rule was blocked by the courts in 2021.  The Biden Administration argues that the latest actions are necessary to streamline a backlogged system and pushes back against comparisons to Trump’s policies. “The Trump Administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,” a senior Administration official said on June 4. “The actions that we are taking today will only apply during times of high encounters,” the official noted, adding that there are exceptions to the rule that differentiate it from those put forth by the Trump administration. “The action will not ban people based on their religion.  It will not separate kids from their mothers.” Both in the U.S. and in shelters in Tijuana, ImmDef provides “Know Your Rights'' presentations that help migrants understand what is expected of them by border officials, including what will happen in credible fear interviews. When asylum-seekers enter the United States, they are referred to U.S. border officials who conduct a credible fear interview (CFI), in which the official determines whether the migrant seeking asylum has a “credible fear” of returning to their home country.  Toczylowski says ImmDef is redoing its “Know Your Rights” presentations in light of the new actions and rethinking its strategies, keeping in mind LGBTQ migrants, indigenous language speakers, and those who they see as most vulnerable after this new policy. Even with Biden’s action, people who legitimately fear being tortured or persecuted in their home country can still seek protection in the United States and will be screened by U.S. asylum officers, but with more scrutiny than before. If that screening is passed, they can pursue limited forms of humanitarian protection. The executive action outlines specific exceptions to the asylum rule for humanitarian reasons, specifically unaccompanied children and victims of a severe form of trafficking. Still, Jennifer Babaie, director of advocacy and legal services at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which provides free and low-cost legal services to migrants and refugees in West Texas, New Mexico and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, says she believes the rule will not change how many people are attempting to cross the border; it will only hinder their ability to receive help. “The new rule is punitive in that legally, it's taking away asylum and just access to that kind of relief for the majority of individuals, but it's not doing anything to stem or block people from walking up to the port of entry,” Babaie says. “It's just increasing the penalty for even being brave enough to do that and requesting asylum.”  Toczylowski of ImmDef agrees, and believes that these deterrence policies are not realistic, since those seeking asylum are not fleeing their home countries because of, or in spite of, U.S. policies, but for their safety and survival  Toczylowski says this feels like a “betrayal” from what she and other immigration rights lawyers and activists were told on Biden’s campaign trail.  Babaie agrees, noting how often Las Americas has sat down with government agencies to relay “on-the-ground” needs from group on the border, asking the Administration to focus on “human-centered” solutions.  “It’s not a lack of information, it’s a willful choice,” Babaie said. “I think it’s a disservice to the public that they’re being told this was necessary.”"
54,Jamie Ducharme,"Every Question You’ve Ever Had About Air Conditioning, Answered",https://time.com/6986625/is-air-conditioning-bad/,How does air conditioning work? Is air conditioning good for air quality and human health? Can air conditioning make you sick?,2024-06-12T12:50:17Z,"Humming air conditioners are the soundtrack to summer in the U.S., given that almost 90% of households use them for cooling. Even though air conditioning is everywhere, however, many people still have questions about exactly how it works, how to use it best, and how it affects air quality, human health, and the environment. TIME spoke to experts to get answers. In the most basic terms, “an air conditioner absorbs heat from the building and dumps it to the outside,” explains Jeffrey Siegel, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who researches ventilation and indoor air quality. More specifically, a compressor moves liquid refrigerant into an indoor coil, where it evaporates and pulls heat from the surrounding air. The gaseous refrigerant then flows to the system's outdoor coil, moving heat out of your home. The gas condenses back into a liquid in the system’s outdoor coil, and the process starts again. Central air-conditioning systems, window units, and mini-splits (which usually sit high on the wall) work in conceptually the same way, but there are differences in how they’re installed and exactly how they transfer heat. Functionally, the biggest difference for consumers is that central systems cool an entire home, whereas window units and mini-splits are designed to work in only one room. It depends on what kind of system you have. Window units and mini-splits typically don’t have high-quality filters, so they don’t do much for air quality beyond temperature regulation, Siegel says. Central air-conditioning systems, however, can offer valuable filtration, catching particulate matter like dust, pet dander, mold, and smog.  The higher a filter’s minimum efficiency reporting value, or MERV, the more it can trap. High-MERV filters can even help remove viruses from indoor air, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but not effectively enough to rely on your AC system alone for disease prevention. If you have central AC, make sure to run the fan for at least 20 minutes an hour, as air only passes through the filter when the fan is actively running, Siegel says. Read More: What to Wear When It's Really Hot Outside The tradeoff is that rooms that are sealed for cooling don’t get much, if any, ventilation from fresh air. “Dilution with outdoor air helps get rid of a lot of stuff,” Siegel says, so it’s a good idea to shut off your AC and open the windows for at least a chunk of every day, as long as outdoor conditions allow. “Sick building syndrome,” which causes people to feel unwell when they spend lots of time indoors, is thought to be linked to inadequate ventilation. In a word: yes. A dirty filter won’t do your health any favors, particularly if it’s harboring bacteria or other disease- or allergy-causing grime.  But the health of your cooling system may be an even more pressing concern. “If you let that gunk build up on your filter, you can destroy your system,” says Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs at the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a manufacturer’s trade association. “The air can no longer get through that filter, so it backs up into the system and it freezes up.” (Short of a total system meltdown, Siegel says, you may simply notice that it’s not working as well as usual.) Exactly how often you need to change or clean your filter depends on the manufacturer’s instructions and how heavily you use your system, Siegel says, but roughly every three months is a good ballpark estimate. From a mechanical perspective, a properly maintained system should be fine to run 24/7, Dietz says. But an old or neglected unit may die under the strain of constant use—hence why many people’s systems “conk out” during a heatwave, he says. Save yourself the emergency repair costs and schedule a routine service appointment every spring, Dietz suggests. And keep in mind that the average central air-conditioning system has a lifespan of about 15 years. Especially if yours is getting close to that point, Dietz says, it’s worth having it inspected before a problem arises. Even if it’s technically possible, though, constantly running your AC does have downsides, says Stan Cox, author of Losing Our Cool: Uncomfortable Truths About Our Air-Conditioned World. Your utility bills will soar, as will your energy usage. Air conditioners use about 6% of all electricity produced in the U.S. and account for the release of 117 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. That means the systems we rely on for cooling are actively contributing to our warming planet. Studies also suggest that the human body can build tolerance to heat through exposure—so completely avoiding warmth by shutting yourself in a refrigerated room at the first sign of spring thaw means you may be extra miserable come August. “Our comfort range is not fixed,” Cox says. “It moves up and down depending on the temperatures you’re exposed to.”  Some people experience respiratory symptoms, like a runny nose or scratchy throat, after sleeping in a heavily air-conditioned room. That may be the result of a dirty system, Siegel says, or it could be due to a lack of ventilation. Air conditioning also removes humidity from the air, Cox says, and that dryness can contribute to symptoms like sore throats and headaches. Read More: How to Properly Cool Your Home With a Fan Most of the time, these symptoms aren’t cause for great concern. But contaminated cooling systems have been linked to serious illnesses like Legionnaires’ disease and can also cause an allergic reaction that leads to lung inflammation. In general, central AC is most efficient if you’re trying to cool an entire house because it has “economies of scale,” Dietz says. It’s designed to reach every nook and cranny of your house using one relatively compact system, whereas you’d need lots of window units or mini-splits if you cooled each room individually. But, Cox says, it’s worth considering how much of your home actually needs to be cooled. You could, for example, place window units or mini-splits in your bedrooms for overnight use and simply use fans in living spaces. That may not be a viable option depending on your family’s schedule, living space, and local climate, but such a system “uses a lot less electricity than keeping the whole house cooled off continuously,” Cox says. Lots of people have rules about when they’ll turn on their AC for the first time—not before June 1, say, or not before the temperatures top 80°F—but those are just personal preferences, Dietz says. There’s no reason you can’t use your air conditioner on a mild day, aside from concerns about energy usage. If you’re on the fence about whether it’s hot enough to turn on your AC, however, Cox recommends trying a fan first. You may be surprised by how well fans work, either on their own or as a way of reducing your air-conditioning usage. Research has even shown that people don’t feel any difference between cranked-up AC versus a fan paired with AC on a lower setting.  Read More: 8 Ways to Stay Hydrated If You Hate Drinking Water “If the ambient air is cooler than your body, the fan is flooding your body with air that’s lower than your skin temperature and blowing away the warm air that accumulates around the surface of your skin,” Cox explains. Circulating the air around you also helps sweat evaporate from your skin, a key part of the cooling process.  That said, fans don’t work on scorching-hot days, when the air around you is hotter than your body temperature. In those cases, you should resort to air conditioning, either in your home or at a community cooling center.  You may notice that even your AC isn’t as effective as usual on an extremely hot day, because it has to work harder to transfer heat from your home’s interior to the outdoor air, Siegel says. Still, as long as your unit is properly maintained, it should work well enough to keep you cool and safe on even the hottest of summer days."
55,Jamie Friedlander Serrano,You’re Vacationing All Wrong. Here’s How to Have a Truly Restful Break,https://time.com/6986803/how-to-vacation-relaxing/,Avoid these vacation mistakes if you want to make the most of your days off.,2024-06-12T16:06:34Z,"Travel can do wonders for your well-being. “Experiencing awe, going to novel places, engaging your creative mind, being in nature, and spending time with family and friends are all things that we know can increase well-being and even reduce stress,” says Stephanie Preston, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. But those perks aren’t a given. As anyone who’s dealt with intrusive work emails or an overly ambitious itinerary can attest, it’s possible to arrive back home from a trip feeling more stressed than you were before you left.  Keeping certain tips in mind as you plan and set out will help you better reap the benefits of travel. Because the positive effects of traveling fade about a month after you return home—and because the planning process can make you happier than the trip itself—traveling more often could be key to improving mental health, says Laurence Chan, instructor of medical psychology at Columbia University. That means taking a few smaller trips may be better than taking one big trip, he says. It may also be easier to fit into a busy life. “If someone is taking a longer vacation, there could also be a logistical limitation to disconnecting, and someone could be more likely to engage in work spillover tasks—like attending a ‘can’t-miss’ meeting or conference call,” he says.  It’s hard, but put your phone away as much as possible—and consider deleting your work email app or social media apps while you’re gone. One 2016 study linked spending less time on one’s phone to a more relaxing vacation.  “I think social media in general is hard to disconnect from,” says Dr. Paul Nestadt, a psychiatrist and director of the Johns Hopkins Anxiety Disorders Clinic. “It can be anxiety-provoking to keep doomscrolling.” He adds that some of his patients actually feel more anxiety from disconnecting entirely, so be mindful of your personality and what suits you best.  If you’re particularly addicted to your phone, Preston recommends choosing a vacation destination that has limited internet access, such as a camping spot in the mountains.  If you’re aiming for a relaxing getaway, you shouldn’t overschedule yourself. But don’t underschedule yourself either, says Henley Vazquez, co-founder of the travel agency Fora.  “There can be the impulse to figure it out when you’re there,” she says. But faced with an empty agenda,  “we end up defaulting to checking our phones.”  Vazquez says a good rule of thumb is to plan a half-day’s worth of activities every day. Consider also preparing a list of restaurants you’d like to try in advance so you don’t succumb to stressfully surfing Yelp from your hotel room.   While it might be tempting to take photos throughout your trip, consider occasionally leaving your camera or phone in your bag and simply enjoying the present moment. “I think it has become almost an impulse to experience your own trip through your social sharing rather than to just experience it on the ground,” Vazquez says. Instead of snapping photos for Instagram, work on savoring your scenic hike, relaxing boat ride, or joy-filled family dinner. “No matter which activities you engage in, I think it’s important to do them fully,” Chan says. “If you’re going to be walking, just walk. If you’re going to be exploring the sites, just take them in.” It might seem like a counterintuitive way to tamp down stress, but try to do extra work before you leave for your trip, Nestadt says. If you don’t, you risk feeling even more overwhelmed when you return home. “That can kind of delete or overwrite the beneficial effects you would’ve had from the trip,” he says.  Even though you might dream of spending 10 days sunbathing and swimming in Hawaii, nine would be better if it means you have a day of rest and recovery between your vacation and returning to work or school.  “If part of the reason you’re taking the vacation is because you need a break, then building a buffer [day] in really allows the recuperation that you’re able to achieve on vacation to last,” Nestadt says. An extra day at home is especially helpful if your trip involves jet lag, Preston adds. One study found that when people exercise on vacation—regardless of whether they do at home—they had improved sleep, heart rates, and well-being. Although a run on the hotel gym’s treadmill is good, it’s even better to break a sweat in nature, as exercising outdoors can lower anxiety and stress. Regular exposure to sunlight has countless benefits for physical and mental health. It can improve sleep, strengthen the immune system, release mood-boosting serotonin, increase vitamin D stores, and lower blood pressure. One study found that people experienced more health benefits from their vacation when they were in a sunny locale rather than an overcast one. If you’re torn between Seattle and San Diego for your next jaunt, for example, you might feel happier and more relaxed if you choose the latter.  You might think traveling with anyone will be fun—a vacation is a vacation, right? Wrong. One study found that who we travel with greatly impacts how much we enjoy our trip. (Out of traveling alone or with someone’s friends, partner, relatives, or colleagues, people enjoyed traveling with their colleagues the least.)  One reason: You might want to rise and shine for a morning hike, for instance, whereas your brother-in-law might want to sleep in and zone out at the beach. “There can be a lot of interpersonal conflict over how you manage the schedule and the priorities,” Preston says.  To truly recharge, think very carefully about how well your vacation desires will mesh with those of your travel companions.  Googling the best restaurants in Mexico City could lead you down a three-hour rabbit hole of research. Instead, consider asking for food recommendations only from your friend who went there a few months ago. “Crowdsource advice from friends who have been places, and they’ll tell you the restaurants to go to or the hikes that were spectacular, and that can save a lot of time,” Preston says.  Packing is personal, Vazquez says. Some people carefully plan their outfits, while others toss a hodgepodge of items into their suitcase and figure it out later. Regardless of your style, she recommends using compression packing cubes to condense your items and serve as portable drawers, keeping you organized while you’re away. “I cannot overemphasize what a game changer these were for me when I found them,” she says. They’re particularly useful for people traveling with kids, as you can pack each family member’s items in a different compression bag.  You might not be able to avoid layovers if you’re traveling somewhere far away, or if your budget doesn’t allow for a nonstop flight. But it’s ideal to take direct flights and streamline travel if you can. Flight connections can be stressful, especially if you’re traveling internationally, have a short layover time, or if one leg of your flight is delayed.  If you’re spending significant time getting to and from your destination, you might not return feeling like you had a truly restful trip, Vazquez says. “You might have even added to your anxiety by making a large portion of your time away dedicated to complicated travel arrangements,” she says."

Authorities said Rebecca Grossman, wife of a prominent Los Angeles burn doctor, fatally struck Mark Iskander, 11, and brother Jacob, 8, while speeding. A Los Angeles jury in February found Rebecca Grossman guilty on all counts: Two felony counts each of second-degree murder and gross vehicular manslaughter, and one felony count of hit-and-run driving resulting in death. Superior Court Judge Joseph Brandolino sentenced her to two concurrent 15-years-to-life sentences, plus three years for fleeing the scene of the fatal crash that would run concurrently with the two other sentences, the Los Angeles Times reported. The judge called Grossman's actions “reckless and unquestionably negligent.” The deadly crash occurred on the evening of Sept. 29, 2020, in Westlake Village, a city on the western edge of Los Angeles County. Prosecutors presented evidence that the data recorder in Grossman’s white Mercedes showed she was speeding at up to 81 mph (130 kph) and tapped her brakes, slowing to 73 mph (117 kph), less than two seconds before a collision that set off her airbags."

Chomsky’s absence from the public eye over the past year fueled speculation about his health, culminating in an outpouring of tributes over the weekend. On Monday, Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo reported that the 95-year-old American public intellectual has not commented on the ongoing war in Gaza, despite requests from his supporters and the press, because he had “a massive stroke” in the U.S. last year. “He has difficulty speaking, and the right side of his body is numb,” it said. According to the report, after American doctors said little more could be done, Chomsky’s wife Valeria decided to fly him to São Paulo, where the couple has had a residence since 2015, to receive specialized treatment. Upon arriving via a rented ambulance jet, Chomsky was reportedly admitted to an intensive care unit, and he is visited daily by a neurologist, speech therapist, and pulmonologist. “His condition has improved significantly,” the paper added. “He left the ICU and is now in a regular room.” Folha de São Paulo also reported that Chomsky, a vocal anti-war advocate, would raise his left arm “in a gesture of lament of anger” when he sees images in the news of the war in Gaza. The paper added that, given the progress in Chomsky’s recovery, the University of São Paulo is considering appointing him an ad hoc professor of linguistics and political science. While reportedly pleased by the idea, Valeria Chomsky is instead considering moving the couple to an apartment near the beach in Rio de Janeiro, because she read that it is beneficial for stroke victims to live in a sunny, flat city. Valeria Chomsky confirmed the details of the Brazilian report in an email to the Associated Press on Tuesday. Noam Chomsky, one of the most prolific and most cited living scholars, is known for his transformative theories in linguistics as well as his political activism and criticisms of U.S. foreign policy, capitalism, and mass media."

Here’s What to Know About the Illness,https://time.com/6987577/paralytic-shellfish-poisoning-fda-warning/,"The FDA issued a warning last week that shellfish originating from growing areas in Netarts Bay and Tillamook Bay, Oregon may be contaminated with the toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP.",2024-06-11T19:50:30Z,"The FDA issued a warning last week that shellfish originating from growing areas in Netarts Bay and Tillamook Bay, Oregon, may be contaminated with the toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP. The administration is advising consumers to avoid eating oysters and clams from the region, including calling on restaurants and food retailers to dispose of them. The contamination has been found in oysters and bay clams distributed in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Oregon and Washington. As of May 30, the FDA had not reported any illnesses or deaths from the poisoning.  Here’s what to know about paralytic shellfish poisoning.  Paralytic shellfish poisoning originates from paralytic shellfish toxin, a naturally occurring biotoxin that is produced in some species of microscopic algae. When molluscan shellfish, such as clams, mussels, oysters, geoduck, and scallops, consume the toxin in algae, they can accumulate the poison. While some species are able to quickly rid themselves of the toxins, others take longer to cleanse it from their systems. The toxin can be passed on to humans through eating shellfish and crabs, which might also become toxic when they feed on infected shellfish.   Symptoms of PSP can occur within 30 minutes of consuming contaminated seafood and can range from tingling of the lips, mouth, and tongue, to respiratory paralysis and may include these other symptoms: numbness of arms and legs, “pins and needles” sensation, weakness, loss of muscle coordination, floating feeling, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, vomiting, and headache.  The FDA advises that Individuals experiencing symptoms of PSP to contact their healthcare provider and report their symptoms to their local Health Department.  There is no specific treatment for PSP and it can be life threatening to humans. Patients are usually given respiratory support and fluid therapy. If patients survive the first 24 hours, their prognosis is considered good, In fatal cases, death is typically due to asphyxiation. Food containing PSTs may look, smell, and taste normal. Cooking or freezing shellfish does not remove the toxins. Most nations have certified PSP testing programs. However, commercially harvested shellfish come from licensed, certified growers that are required to meet state and federal health standards and undergo regular testing for toxins."
59,AMY BETH HANSON / AP,Reported Birth of Rare White Buffalo Calf in Yellowstone Park Fulfills Lakota Prophecy,https://time.com/6987690/reported-birth-rare-white-buffalo-calf-in-yellowstone-park-fulfills-lakota-prophecy/,The reported birth of a rare white buffalo in Yellowstone National Park fulfills a Lakota prophecy that portends better times.,2024-06-12T00:36:40Z,"Helena, Mont. — The reported birth of a rare white buffalo in Yellowstone National Park fulfills a Lakota prophecy that portends better times, according to members of the American Indian tribe who cautioned that it’s also a signal that more must be done to protect the earth and its animals. “The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do more,” said Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, and the 19th keeper of the sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle. The birth of the sacred calf comes as after a severe winter in 2023 drove thousands of Yellowstone buffalo, also known as bison, to lower elevations. More than 1,500 were killed, sent to slaughter or transferred to tribes seeking to reclaim stewardship over an animal their ancestors lived alongside for millennia. Erin Braaten of Kalispell took several photos of the calf shortly after it was born on June 4 in the Lamar Valley in the northeastern corner of the park. Her family was visiting the park when she spotted “something really white” among a herd of bison across the Lamar River. Traffic ended up stopping while bison crossed the road, so Braaten stuck her camera out the window to take a closer look with her telephoto lens. “I look and it's this white bison calf. And I was just totally, totally floored,” she said. After the bison cleared the roadway, the Braatens turned their vehicle around and found a spot to park. They watched the calf and its mother for 30 to 45 minutes. “And then she kind of led it through the willows there,” Braaten said. Although Braaten came back each of the next two days, she didn't see the white calf again. For the Lakota, the birth of a white buffalo calf with a black nose, eyes and hooves is akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ, Looking Horse said. Lakota legend says about 2,000 years ago — when nothing was good, food was running out and bison were disappearing — White Buffalo Calf Woman appeared, presented a bowl pipe and a bundle to a tribal member, taught them how to pray and said that the pipe could be used to bring buffalo to the area for food. As she left, she turned into a white buffalo calf. “And some day when the times are hard again,” Looking Horse said in relating the legend, “I shall return and stand upon the earth as a white buffalo calf, black nose, black eyes, black hooves.” A similar white buffalo calf was born in Wisconsin in 1994 and was named Miracle, he said. Troy Heinert, the executive director of the South Dakota-based InterTribal Buffalo Council, said the calf in Braaten's photos looks like a true white buffalo because it has a black nose, black hooves and dark eyes. “From the pictures I've seen, that calf seems to have those traits,” said Heinert, who is Lakota. An albino buffalo would have pink eyes. A naming ceremony has been held for the Yellowstone calf, Looking Horse said, though he declined to reveal the name. A ceremony celebrating the calf's birth is set for June 26 at the Buffalo Field Campaign headquarters in West Yellowstone. Other tribes also revere white buffalo. “Many tribes have their own story of why the white buffalo is so important,” Heinert said. “All stories go back to them being very sacred.” Heinert and several members of the Buffalo Field Campaign say they've never heard of a white buffalo being born in Yellowstone, which has wild herds. Park officials had not seen the buffalo yet and could not confirm its birth in the park, and they have no record of a white buffalo being born in the park previously. Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association, could not quantify how rare the calf is. “To my knowledge, no one’s ever tracked the occurrence of white buffalo being born throughout history. So I’m not sure how we can make a determination how often it occurs.” Besides herds of the animals on public lands or overseen by conservation groups, about 80 tribes across the U.S. have more than 20,000 bison, a figure that’s been growing in recent years. In Yellowstone and the surrounding area, the killing or removal of large numbers of bison happens almost every winter, under an agreement between federal and Montana agencies that has limited the size of the park’s herds to about 5,000 animals. Yellowstone officials last week proposed a slightly larger population of up to 6,000 bison, with a final decision expected next month. But ranchers in Montana have long opposed increasing the Yellowstone herds or transferring the animals to tribes. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte has said he would not support any management plan with a population target greater than 3,000 Yellowstone bison. Heinert sees the calf's birth as a reminder “that we need to live in a good way and treat others with respect.” “I hope that calf is safe and gonna live its best life in Yellowstone National Park, exactly where it was designed to be,” Heinert said."

Though Roan released multiple songs in 2020 that would later appear on her debut album, those singles did not achieve the success Atlantic had hoped for, and the label dropped her that year. In September 2023, she released The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess with Amusement Records—producer Dan Nigro’s label under Island Records—to widespread acclaim. Midwest Princess made multiple best-of-the-year lists, including TIME’s in 2023. Following a solo tour in support of the album, Roan found a new audience after opening for Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS World Tour in early 2024. In April, Roan made her Coachella debut, and since then, has skyrocketed to fame. Audiences are falling in love with the 26-year-old star for many reasons. Her incredibly catchy yet honest songs speak to listeners, as does her sincerity online and with her fans. Here’s everything to know about the rise of Chappell Roan. sing it lesbian lady liberty pic.twitter.com/UyNZgPClUT Chappell’s music is all about queer experiences, from messy moments of heartbreak to ecstatic discoveries of love and sex. Her witty lyrics and infectious melodies bring listeners along on journeys through situationships, passionate affairs, breakups, and even the satisfaction of seeing an ex get what they deserve.  In “Pink Pony Club,” one of the singles she released in 2020, the narrator yearns to leave their home in Tennessee and go to a “special place where boys and girls can be queens every single day” and in “Red Wine Supernova” she sings about the rush of falling too fast for a ""Brigitte Bardot"" type. Her latest, “Good Luck, Babe!” has a sharp message for a woman who chooses men over her: “When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night, with your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife. And when you think about me, all of those years ago, you’re standing face to face with ‘I told you so.’”  “This is such an exciting time in queer music, but pop music in general,” she told TIME earlier this year. “I think people are getting a little bit more risky and that’s always when great pop music is born. No fear of looking raunchy, or that you’re gonna make people upset.” A chart created by a data journalist and shared online traces how Chappell’s monthly listeners on Spotify have grown quickly since she released her album in September. In March 2023, she had about 3 million monthly listeners. Just a little more than a year later, she has more than 20 million each month. as the world's foremost Chappell Roan data journalist, I bring you an update on her Spotify monthly listeners – she's increased over tenfold since the start of 2024, which is WILD pic.twitter.com/ZHCjDnTaiA The stark increase in her fandom can be seen in the crowds at her most recent performances. A post shared by Boston Calling (@bostoncalling) A post shared by ･ﾟ: *✧ Chappell Roan ✧*:･ﾟ (@chappellroan) At Gov Ball earlier this month, Roan revealed that she turned down an opportunity to perform at the White House. “In response to the White House who asked me to perform for Pride: we want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that’s when I’ll come.” Chappell Roan recently turned down an invitation to perform at The White House for pride.  pic.twitter.com/zlJymlUwmW It’s not just the fans who have noticed the positive responses from audiences: in recent days, programmers for the Bonnaroo music festival moved her to the main stage for her performance, and the All Things Go music festival announced she will be performing on its New York stop.  Roan's social media footprint dates back a couple of years. On TikTok, she used to promote her music with occasional makeup tutorials for some of her more dramatic looks set to one of her singles.

At her most recent performance in Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 12, she got emotional about her rapid rise to fame and shared how overwhelming the experience has been. She took a second to address the crowd as she wiped away tears.  “I just want to be honest with the crowd. I feel a little off today, because I think my career is going really fast and it’s hard to keep up,” she says in the video. “I’m just being honest, I’m having a hard time today.” Chappell Roan tears up onstage at Raleigh concert:“I just want to be honest with the crowd.

62,DAVE COLLINS and JUAN A. LOZANO / AP,Alex Jones’ Assets Will Be Sold to Pay $1.5B Sandy Hook Debt as Future of Infowars Remains Uncertain,https://time.com/6988981/alex-jones-assets-sold-sandy-hook-debt/,A federal judge on Friday ordered the liquidation of Alex Jones′ personal assets but dismissed his company’s separate bankruptcy case.,2024-06-14T23:25:46Z,"Houston — A federal judge on Friday ordered the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones′ personal assets but dismissed his company’s separate bankruptcy case, leaving the future of his Infowars media platform uncertain as he owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Judge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones’ proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation, but threw out the attempted reorganization of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems. Many of the Sandy Hook families had asked that the company also be liquidated. If Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy reorganization had been converted to a liquidation, Jones could have lost ownership of the company, its social media accounts, the Infowars studio in Austin and all copyrights as the company’s possessions were sold. Jones smiled as the judge dismissed the company’s case. It wasn’t immediately clear what will happen to Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company that Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years. One scenario could be that the company and Infowars are allowed to keep operating while efforts to collect on the $1.5 billion debt are made in state courts in Texas and Connecticut, where the families won lawsuits against Jones, according to lawyers involved with the case. Another scenario is that lawyers for the Sandy Hook families go back to the bankruptcy court and ask Lopez to liquidate the company as part of Jones’ personal case, because Jones owns the business, lawyers said. Lopez said his sole focus in determining whether to dismiss Free Speech Systems’ case or order a liquidation was what would be best for the company and its creditors, including the Sandy Hook families. Lopez also said Free Speech Systems’ case appeared to be one of the longest running of its kind in the country, and it was approaching a deadline to resolve it. “I was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another,” Lopez said. “This case is one of the more difficult cases I’ve had. When you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.” Many of Jones’ personal assets will be sold off, but his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. He already has moved to sell his Texas ranch worth about $2.8 million, a gun collection and other assets to pay debts. In the lead-up to Friday’s hearing, Jones had been telling his web viewers and radio listeners that Free Speech Systems was on the verge of being shut down because of the bankruptcy. He urged them to download videos from his online archive to preserve them and pointed them to a new website of his father’s company if they want to continue buying the dietary supplements he sells on his show. “This is probably the end of Infowars here very, very soon. If not today, in the next few weeks or months,” Jones told reporters before Friday’s hearing. “But it’s just the beginning of my fight against tyranny.” Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, according to the most recent financial filings in court. Free Speech Systems, which employs 44 people, has about $6 million in cash on hand and about $1.2 million worth of inventory, according to J. Patrick Magill, the chief restructuring officer appointed by the court to run the company during the bankruptcy. Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022, when relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the families in the Connecticut case, said liquidating Free Speech Systems would “enable the Connecticut families to enforce their $1.4 billion in judgments now and into the future while also depriving Jones of the ability to inflict mass harm as he has done for some 25 years.” The relatives said they were traumatized by Jones’ comments and his followers' actions. They have testified about being harassed and threatened by Jones’ believers, some of whom confronted the grieving families in person saying the shooting never happened and their children never existed. One parent said someone threatened to dig up his dead son's grave. Jones and Free Speech Systems initially filed for bankruptcy reorganization protection that would have allowed him to run Infowars while paying the families with revenues from his show. But the two sides couldn't agree on a final plan, and Jones recently filed for permission to switch his personal bankruptcy from a reorganization to a liquidation. The families in the Connecticut lawsuit, including relatives of eight dead children and adults, asked that Free Speech Systems' bankruptcy case also be converted to a liquidation. But the parents in the Texas suit — whose child, 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, died — want the company's case dismissed. Lawyers for the company filed documents indicating it supported liquidation, but attorneys for Jones' personal bankruptcy case wanted the judge to dismiss the company's case. Kyle Kimpler, an attorney for the families seeking liquidation, had told the judge that dismissing the case could lead to a “race to the courthouse."" It's possible one family could get everything while another gets nothing, he added. Although Jones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook shooting happened, he has been saying on his recent shows that Democrats and the “deep state” are conspiring to shut down his companies and take away his free speech rights. He also has said the Sandy Hook families are being used as pawns in the conspiracy. The families’ lawyers say that is nonsense. The families have a pending lawsuit in Texas accusing Jones of illegally diverting and hiding millions of dollars. Jones has denied the allegations. ___ Collins reported from Hartford, Connecticut."

The man was last seen on Tuesday in Mathraki, a small island near the larger Greek island of Corfu. He was found dead on a beach on the island on Sunday. The cause of death has not yet been disclosed. The Corfu medical examiner arrived at the scene later in the day, according to Corfu TV News. In an email to TIME on Sunday evening, the U.S. State Department was able to confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in Greece. Respecting the privacy of the deceased's family, they declined to provide further comment at this time. Meanwhile, the search continues for retired U.S. police officer Albert Calibet, 59, who went missing on Tuesday after going on a solo hike on the Greek island of Amorgos.  When contacted by TIME in regards to Albert Calibet, a State Department spokesperson confirmed, in an emailed statement sent on Friday, that they were aware of reports of a missing U.S. person in Greece, and that they stood ready to provide assistance to U.S. citizens and families.  Another tourist, a 74-year old Dutch man, went missing on Sunday, June 9, on the Greek island of Samos, after hiking alone. His wife reported him missing on Sunday afternoon. Samos, like Symi where Mosley was found, lies close to the Turkish border. On Saturday, June 15, the tourist was found dead by a drone operated by local firefighters, according to local newspaper Samos Voice. and reported by the Associated Press. TIME has reached out to Dutch authorities and local Samos officials for comment and further information. Greece has been confronting intense heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 38C/100.4F. Popular tourist sites like Acropolis Hill, along with multiple schools and nurseries, closed mid-week due to high temperatures.   The search team for U.S. tourist Calibet is made up of South Aegean Police Command officers, the Embassy, ​​Coast Guard volunteers, the Amorgos Volunteer Rescue Team, and a group from the Greek island of Paros, according to a Greek newsite. An aerial search was is also underway for Calibet. The tourist is “well-known on the island” due to numerous visits over the course of the past few years, Calliope Despotidi, the deputy mayor of Amorgos, told the Greek Reporter. Authorities have been attempting to track Calibet’s phone, and are also using drones to help facilitate the search. Calibet was last in communication with his sister on Tuesday when he sent her a photo of a trail sign, per the Greek Reporter. He was reportedly supposed to meet with a friend between noon and 1 p.m. local time, but never showed up. Officials believe that Calibet deviated from his original hiking route, which was expected to take a travel time of just over four hours.  Calibet started working at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy in 1998, according to the Los Angeles Times. After his retirement, he worked at the department as a part-time employee.  Calibet disappeared shortly after British TV doctor Michael Mosley was found dead on the Greek island of Symi. Authorities said Mosley most likely died due to natural causes, though there are more reports to be done before the official cause of death can be determined. In addition to the U.S. citizens discussed above, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea, on Friday. Per AP, the two women, aged 73 and 64, ""had left their respective hotels to meet."""

Kathy Hochul is considering banning face masks on the subway because of reported antisemitic acts perpetrated by people wearing masks.,2024-06-14T19:24:50Z,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering banning face masks for riders using the city’s subway system because she has received reports of antisemitic incidents perpetrated by people wearing masks. During a news conference Thursday, Hochul said she had started speaking to lawmakers about the possibility of drafting a bill. But she acknowledged that the issue was complicated, since many people wear masks for health, religious, and cultural reasons. The governor said she was looking into this issue after “a group donning masks took over a subway car, scaring riders and chanting things about Hitler and wiping out Jews” on Monday night.  That wasn't the only incident that's happened, though, as the governor's office said that incidents involving masked individuals making threats on the subway have been widely reported. “We will not tolerate individuals using masks to evade [responsibility] for criminal or threatening behavior,” Hochul said during the news conference. “My team is working on a solution, but on a subway, people should not be able to hide behind a mask to commit crimes.” “There’s obviously a problem here,” she added.. “This will be dealt with.” Read More: New York’s Mayor Wants to Make People Take Their Face Masks Off Following a String of Robberies Hochul said if a bill was drafted, there would be “common sense exceptions.”  While many people have stopped wearing face masks since the number of COVID-19 cases have declined, others still use them in public settings, including on the subway. Masks were required for subway riders during the pandemic, up until September 2022. “I assure everyone, we understand how complex this issue is,” Hochul said. “And we’re just listening to people and addressing their needs and taking them very seriously. So we’ll be reporting more on that in the near future as well.”"
65,Alana Semuels,Why Car Prices Are Finally Falling,https://time.com/6988412/car-prices-falling/,New vehicle prices were down in May for the eighth consecutive month,2024-06-13T19:28:45Z,"Two years ago, David Rosenberg’s dealership lots were virtually empty; cars would sell as soon as they arrived. Today, Rosenberg, president of DSR Motors, which has 12 dealerships across New England, says he’s offering up huge deals to get vehicles off the lots because he has so much inventory.  Rosenberg has been forced to offer big price cuts for brands like Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) and Nissan, as well as some Subaru models. “For some cars it’s a buyers market,” he says. “We’re taking off $25,000—crazy numbers.”  Car prices aren’t just falling at Rosenberg’s lots. New vehicle prices in May were down nearly 1% from a year ago, representing the eighth month in a row that prices have dropped, according to estimates by Kelley Blue Book.  One big reason dealers like Rosenberg have so much inventory compared to a year ago is pandemic-related. As automakers suspended production during COVID-19, shipping lanes became clogged, and semiconductors were in short supply. Dealers had a difficult time getting cars on their lots as a result. There were so few cars available in 2021 and 2022 that sellers could charge soaring prices to people desperate for a vehicle. (Including me.) Consumers, flush with cash from stimulus packages, competed over the limited number of cars available, driving up prices further.  Read More: How To Negotiate With Car Dealers. This continued until the end of last year, Rosenberg says. Now, though, dealers have a lot more cars—so many that they are incentivized to sell them if they sit around too long. There were 2.89 million cars available at the beginning of June, the highest number since late 2020 and a 55% increase from a year ago, according to Cox Automotive’s vAuto Live Market View.  The relief for consumers represents a big shift from a year ago, when prices were still climbing. In May 2023, new vehicles cost 4.7% more than they did the previous year, according to government data. That same government data shows new car prices are down 0.8% from a year ago.   It’s not all good news for car buyers. Interest rates for car loans are roughly four percentage points higher than they were in April 2022, according to a recent report from the Bank of America Institute. The cost of car insurance is skyrocketing. Even if prices drop further, the costs of borrowing and insurance could make consumers’ monthly payments higher than they have been. A recent Bank of America / Market Landscape Insights study found that 45% of respondents said they had trouble paying vehicle loan payments and vehicle maintenance costs. “Even though prices are down, you may not be feeling as much relief as you’d hoped for,” says Kevin Roberts, CarGurus’ director of industry insights and analytics.  There are some options from people who want to get a good deal. Many dealers still have 2023 models on their lots, and 2025 models are going to roll out soon, so dealers will likely offer specials, says Roberts. Used-car prices have dropped 9.3% from a year ago, according to government data.  Read More: Why We're Spending So Much Money. Even electric cars are getting more affordable, thanks to increased competition, faster production, and government tax credits. Research from CarGurus suggests that prices on some used EV models are a whopping 36% lower than they were a year ago.  Of course, the cost of both new and used cars is still higher than it was before the pandemic. That’s probably not going to change anytime soon. Wages are higher. Parts are more expensive. Today, everything costs more.  "

The proposed change would effectively close that loophole by barring credit reporting companies from disclosing medical debts to lenders, and prevent lenders from using that debt to make lending decisions.  ""The CFPB is seeking to end the senseless practice of weaponizing the credit reporting system to coerce patients into paying medical bills that they do not owe,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a Tuesday press release. ""Medical bills on credit reports too often are inaccurate and have little to no predictive value when it comes to repaying other loans."" Medical debt is strenuous on many Americans. Per a 2022 CFPB report, the U.S. has $88 billion in medical debt, though the Bureau estimates that amount could be much higher. The burden of medical debt disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic populations.  Even though more than 90% of the U.S. population has some form of health insurance, many are overburdened by high levels of debt associated with medical costs, which often leads people to cut spending on food, clothing, and other household items, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Read More: For Hospitals, ‘Nonprofit’ Doesn’t Mean ‘Charitable’ The Biden Administration has been working on removing or eliminating medical debt for consumers, as the CFPB found that medical debts “provide less predictive value to lenders than other debts on credit reports.”  TransUnion, Equifax and Experian removed cleared medical debt from credit reports starting in  July 2022, removing red markers on their credit reports. FICO and VantageScore have also announced that they decreased the extent to which medical bills affect people’s credit scores.  Under the proposed rule, companies would also be banned from taking or repossessing medical devices, like wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, if people cannot pay off a loan.  The CFPB has opened the rule for comment through August 12, as per the rulemaking process. If the rule is finalized, the CFPB estimates that Americans with medical debt on their credit report will see an increase of 20 points on average.  Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories here"

They claim that Apple, of Cupertino, California, determined starting salaries before 2018 by asking employees for their compensation history and that this practice “perpetuated historic pay disparities between men and women.” Then, when California outlawed the practice, the iPhone maker started asking for salary expectations, entrenching the disparity, the women claim.  “Apple’s policy and practice of collecting such information about pay expectations and using that information to set starting salaries has had a disparate impact on women, and Apple’s failure to pay women and men equal wages for performing substantially similar work is simply not justified under the law,” Joe Sellers, a lawyer at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC representing the employees, said in a statement. The two employees, Justina Jong and Amina Salgado, also claim that in performance reviews, men at Apple routinely get higher scores on teamwork and leadership, resulting in lower bonuses and pay for the women.  Jong realized she was being paid about $10,000 less than a male colleague only after she saw his W-2 form on the office printer, according to the statement.  A representative of Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit, filed Thursday in California state court. Lawsuits claiming pay discrimination against women in the tech industry have sometimes ended in substantial settlements that nonetheless can work out to a paycheck or two per person. The lawyers who filed Thursday’s suit include those who have brought similar claims against Oracle Corp. and Google and won average per-person payouts of $3,750 and $5,500, respectively, after legal costs. Jong and Salgado filed the suit on behalf of more than 12,000 current and former female employees in Apple’s engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions in California. They have both worked at Apple for more than a decade, according to the complaint.  Salgado complained to Apple about the pay disparity a “number of times” but, despite conducting its own investigation, Apple didn’t raise her salary until a third-party probe concluded there was a pay gap between her and her male counterparts, according to the complaint. She didn’t receive back pay, according to her lawyers. Jong and Salgado are seeking unspecified wages they say they are owed. The suit was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  The case is Jong v. Apple, California Superior Court, San Francisco County."
68,Andrew R. Chow,How AI Is Fueling a Boom in Data Centers and Energy Demand,https://time.com/6987773/ai-data-centers-energy-usage-climate-change/,Artificial intelligence is causing the rapid construction and usage of data centers around the world—potentially imperiling climate goals.,2024-06-12T16:17:47Z,"While AI could change the world in many unforeseen ways, it’s already having one massive impact: a voracious consumption of energy. Generative AI does not simply float upon ephemeral intuition. Rather, it gathers strength via thousands of computers in data centers across the world, which operate constantly on full blast. In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast that global data center electricity demand will more than double from 2022 to 2026, with AI playing a major role in that increase.  AI industry insiders say the world has plenty of energy capacity to absorb this increased demand, and that technological efficiency improvements could offset these increases. But others are skeptical about the industry’s promises, and worry its aggressive consumption of fossil fuel energy sources will hamper collective efforts to combat climate change.  Here’s how we arrived at this point, and what the rise of data centers could mean for communities on a local and global level.  When someone’s phone data gets backed up to the “cloud,” it really gets stored in data centers: massive facilities filled with thousands of computer servers running on a constant basis. In the era of 5G and cloud-based storage, data centers have become essential infrastructural cogs, supporting everything from financial transactions, to social media, to government operations. Data centers need a continuous and stable supply of energy to operate. They now account for more than 1% of global electricity use, according to the IEA. Data centers were already vastly increasing in number before AI. The bitcoin mining industry played a role in this increase: A report from the Energy Information Administration found that bitcoin mining was responsible for 2 percent of the nation’s total electricity demand in 2023.   But the tech industry’s hard pivot into AI has even more dramatically escalated their construction and usage. That’s because it is extremely energy intensive to train AI models, which burn through power at a far higher rate than traditional data center activities. A ChatGPT query, for example, uses ten times more energy than a standard Google query, says David Porter, a vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute. Porter says that while 10-20% of data center energy in the U.S. is currently consumed by AI, that percentage will likely “increase significantly” going forward.  This energy usage has been exacerbated by the stiff competition between major tech companies, who are racing to build more powerful generative AI models. Researchers recently found that the cost of the computational power required to train these models is doubling every nine months, with no slowdown in sight. As a result, the IEA predicts that in two years, data centers could consume the same amount of energy as Sweden or Germany. Relatedly, researchers at UC Riverside estimated that global AI demand could cause data centers to consume over 1 trillion gallons of fresh water by 2027.  Despite these staggering figures, the exact energy consumption of many AI models remains opaque. “For the longest time, companies like Google and Meta were pretty transparent: up until ChaptGPT came out, quite honestly,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher and the climate lead at the AI platform Hugging Face. “In the last year and a half, they’ve gotten a lot more secretive about data sources, training time, hardware, and energy.”  Read More: The Billion-Dollar Price Tag of Building AI This rapid increase in energy usage threatens to derail the climate pledges that major tech companies set for themselves before the AI hype cycle. In 2020, for example, Google set a goal to run on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030. Microsoft made a similar pledge the same year, vowing to become carbon negative in a decade.  But last year, Microsoft took a massive step backwards in that regard by increasing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, mostly due to its ambitious AI pursuits. “In 2020, we unveiled what we called our carbon moonshot. That was before the explosion in artificial intelligence,” Microsoft president Brad Smith told Bloomberg. “So in many ways the moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020, if you just think of our own forecast for the expansion of AI and its electrical needs.” Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, has spent more than $10 billion in past quarters on cloud-computing capacity, and is planning to double its data center capacity. In Goodyear, Arizona, which faces a water shortage, Microsoft’s data centers are expected to consume more than 50 million gallons of drinking water every year.  Some locales are pushing back against data center construction. There is currently a de facto moratorium against them in Dublin, as they already consume nearly a fifth of Ireland’s electricity. But data centers are ramping up massively elsewhere—including Northern Virginia, colloquially known as Data Center Alley. Just outside of Washington D.C., historically residential tracts of land are quickly being rezoned as industrial to make room for data centers, drawing the ire of local citizens. Because it is cheaper for companies to build data centers in places with robust power sources and existing infrastructure, many of them cluster together. Data centers are now the “number one issue we hear about from our constituents,” says Ian Lovejoy, a Republican state delegate in Virginia. Aside from quality of life concerns, he says that local politicians and residents are worried about data centers threatening electricity and water access, as well as the idea that taxpayers may have to foot the bill for future power lines.  “Today, there isn't enough power generation capacity or transmission capacity to fuel the data centers that are in the pipeline,” Lovejoy says.  “Everyone's just kind of gambling that we will build up the infrastructure and everything will be fine. But if the data centers outpace power generation, you could see brownouts, and a real constrained power situation growing.”  Of the 8,000 data centers that exist globally, about a third are in the U.S., compared to 16% in Europe and almost 10% in China. The Hong Kong-based think tank China Water Risk estimates that data centers in China consume 1.3 billion cubic meters of water per year—nearly double the volume that the city of Tianjin, home to 13.7 million people, uses for households and services.  The very companies consuming all of this energy say they are working on solutions. Many AI boosters argue that their technology will be crucial towards combating climate change, in part by combating inefficiencies. In 2016, for example, Google announced that its DeepMind AI had helped reduce its company’s data center cooling energy usage by “up to 40 percent.” Efficiency improvements in chip hardware could also have a big impact in reducing energy usage. This year, NVIDIA rolled out a new line of GPUs (graphics processing units) with 25 times lower energy consumption than its previous models. However, Luccioni believes that any hardware efficiency gains may be offset by Jevons Paradox, named after a 19th century British economist who noticed that as steam engines became more efficient, Britain’s appetite for coal actually increased. “The more a resource becomes more efficient, the more people will use it,” she says.  Industry insiders also argue that they are leading the way in the energy transition, by spurring the construction of renewable energy sources, particularly in wind, solar and nuclear. But many new data centers are still powered by fossil fuels, especially because it takes a while for new energy sources to come online. “Unfortunately, a lot of renewables don’t meet the needs of high speed compute, in their demand for consistent and high quality energy,” says Paul Prager, the CEO of the bitcoin mining company Terawulf, which is also expanding into AI. “And you can’t snap your fingers and have a power plant tomorrow. I think we’re in for a near term period over the next three to four years where we’ll see energy costs escalate a little bit on a local level.”   Regulation may be on the way. Singapore announced a sustainability standard for data centers in tropical countries last year, and the European Commission moved towards regulating data center sustainability across the EU. In the U.S., Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey introduced a bill to study the environmental impacts of AI in February, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing about the energy usage of AI in June. “Transparency is currently our main hurdle, because many people don’t realize the environmental impacts of AI: and not only consumers, but lawmakers and companies,” Luccioni says. “When we establish transparency and start having a little bit more information, then we can start trying to regulate.” "

Apple announced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday that it will finally be bringing the Calculator app to the iPad, receiving praise from those in attendance and on social media. The first version of the iPad was released in 2010, and in the 14 years since then, the tablet has never had Apple’s official Calculator app. Without the official app, iPad users who wanted to do math on their tablets either had to turn to a web browser or download a third-party app. But that will change when iPadOS 18 arrives this fall. In addition to the usual math calculations, the app will be able to do unit conversions.  The new iPad version of the app will also include a new feature called Math Notes, which will allow users to write math problems by hand with the Apple Pencil, and then the Calculator app will automatically solve the problems. Users will be able to go beyond basic math problems to use functions from the scientific calculator, such as logarithmic equations.

72,Associated Press,"U.S. Braces for Extreme Weather, From Southern Heat to Possible Snow in the Rockies",https://time.com/6989085/us-extreme-weather-southern-heatwave-snow-forecast-rockies/,"Some states are bracing for an intense heatwave, while the Pacific Northwest will experience unseasonably cold weather.",2024-06-15T19:05:14Z,"After days of intense flooding in Florida, that state and many others are bracing for an intense heat wave, while the Pacific Northwest will experience unseasonably cold weather and there is a potential for late-season snow in the Rocky Mountains early next week. The chaotic weather map includes the possibility of severe thunderstorms developing in between hot and cold fronts. Forecasters said the colliding fronts could lead to areas of flash flooding between eastern Nebraska and northern Wisconsin on Saturday night, as well as strong storms across parts of eastern Montana into North and South Dakota. Meanwhile a plume of tropical moisture will reach the central Gulf Coast during the next couple of days, with heavy rain expected to start Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. “They're all related,” said David Roth, a forecaster with the National Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “This heat that's going to be building over the Midwest and the Northeast is because we have an unusually amplified weather pattern for June.” A trough of low pressure in the Northwest brought scattered thunderstorms and hail to Seattle and other cities in western Washington in the afternoon, and frost warnings prompted gardeners in northern Idaho to cover delicate plants for the weekend. In Phoenix, temperatures reached 111 degrees Fahrenheit by 5 p.m. and were predicted to climb a few degrees higher. Lee Franklin, a spokesperson for the Phoenix Public Library, said more than 5,000 visitors had sought respite at library cooling centers so far, including a new, 24-hour one at the Burton Barr Library. “We definitely see a need and a use of our heat relief effort on these high-heat days,” Franklin said. Forecasters said the threat of heavy rains in Florida continues to dissipate, but some thunderstorms could cause local flooding given the already saturated soil. Some areas between Miami and Fort Lauderdale were left underwater in recent days as storms dumped up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) in southern parts of the state. The damaging no-name storm system coincided with the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity. Across much of the southern parts of the country, temperatures were rising Saturday. In Atlanta, where highs were forecast to near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) both weekend days, city officials opened a cooling center to provide relief. The city also postponed a “Family and Friends Field Day” due to the heat. And in the west Texas city of El Paso, Saturday highs were expected to approach 105 F (40.6 C), and the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory through Monday morning for the region. The city has opened five cooling centers that will operate daily until further notice. Though Arizona is entering its three-month monsoon season, when a shift in wind patterns typically pulls moisture in from the tropical coast of Mexico, no rain is forecast for most of the coming week. “No chances of rain across the state,” National Weather Service meteorologist Ted Whittock said, while noting that there is a 30% chance of showers in southeastern Arizona next Friday. An atmospheric river of moist air is getting funneled into the upper Midwest, causing an unusual “moderate risk of excessive rainfall” from Sunday into next week in Minnesota, Roth said. “They don't get heavy rain events like this very often. We're forecasting up to 7 inches in Minnesota — it can't be understated how unusual this is,” Roth said. The last time the state tallied that much precipitation in one event was in 2008, he said. In Tennessee, tens of thousands of revelers at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival braved a hot, sunny weekend to take in more than 150 performances at the 700-acre farm campground and concert venue that hosts the annual event. While medical crews treated various heat-related conditions, some fans constructed elaborate canopy and tent combinations for shade. Others had their sunscreen confiscated upon entry because of restrictions on full-size bottles and aerosol cans, The Tennessean reported. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and New England will likely peak in the mid- to upper 90s next week, which is “nothing to sneeze at even in the middle of the summer, let alone this early in the summer,” National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said. The high humidity will make it feel even hotter in many places, he added. The expected highs in the Northeast could set daily and even monthly records over the next several days, Roth said. Even northern Maine has a very low chance of reaching 100 degrees, he said. “The town of Caribou in northern Maine usually counts how many 80-degree days they have in a year. The fact that they have any chance of reaching 100 is very unusual,” Roth said. Last year the U.S. had the most heat waves — abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days — since 1936. In the South and Southwest, last year was the worst on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While most of the country bakes, parts of Montana have been placed under winter storm watches with a potential for wet snow lasting into Monday night. Churchill said the northwestern cold front is connected to the heat wave because one extreme is often accompanied by the other. Heavy rain and sporadic thunderstorms were expected in western Washington into Saturday evening. In Edmonds, where an outdoor art festival was underway, the National Weather Service warned in the early afternoon that a stronger thunderstorm was headed in. Hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts in the state's Cascade Mountains and Montana’s Rocky Mountains were also likely to see snow at lower elevations than normal. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather watch for north-central Idaho and western Montana from Sunday through Tuesday. The agency warned of a hypothermia risk and said backcountry roads could become impassible due to the expected snowfall and possible downed trees and branches. As much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of heavy, wet snow was expected in the mountains around Missoula, Montana, and as much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) was predicted for higher elevations around Glacier National Park."
73,Harry Booth,‘They’re Selling You Down the River.’ Musk Slams Apple Deal with OpenAI,https://time.com/6987391/elon-musk-apple-openai/,Elon Musk took aim at Apple after it announced a deal to use OpenAI’s technology on its devices.,2024-06-11T14:05:02Z,"Elon Musk took aim at Apple after it announced a partnership to use OpenAI’s technology on its devices. Musk took to his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to voice concerns about Apple potentially integrating OpenAI at the operating system level, after the tie-up was announced Monday, calling the deal a security risk.  “If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” Musk wrote. “Visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage.” Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company’s new AI offering, which the company dubs “Apple Intelligence,” during the tech giant’s developers conference on June 10. Apple Intelligence will significantly expand Siri’s capabilities, but also add writing and image generation tools to Apple’s stock apps like Mail and Notes. The company also unveiled a new deal with OpenAI, which allows Apple to integrate ChatGPT directly into its digital assistant Siri and its generative AI tools. Cook said Apple plans to offer integration with other AI models in future. During his presentation at the event, Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, emphasized privacy, saying that Apple Intelligence is aware of personal data without collecting it. However, Musk didn’t appear convinced. “It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!” he posted to X after Apple’s announcement. “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,” he added. “They’re selling you down the river.” Apple has already created its own AI models, which underpin many of the new features it announced this week, and run locally on-device. For more complex tasks, Apple uses its own larger models running on what it calls “Private Cloud Compute”. According to Apple, these servers do not store customer data, and only use it to verify requests. Approved volunteers appended this information to Musk’s post on X via a “Community Note”—a feature Musk has touted in the past as a way to combat misinformation. “Private Cloud Compute uses your data only to fulfill your request, and never stores it, making sure it’s never accessible to anyone, including Apple. And we’ve designed the system so that independent experts can verify these protections,” Federighi said. Alongside its own models, Apple will integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Siri and its new generative tools to prevent the need for “jumping between tools.” Apple said users will be asked before sharing any information with ChatGPT. A demonstration of the tool indicates that users will be prompted with the option to accept input from ChatGPT for each task. Musk’s comments come amid heightened concerns over AI’s potential to infringe on user privacy. In May Microsoft drew criticism from a privacy watchdog for a new AI feature that would regularly capture users’ screens. Meta, sparked backlash recently when it introduced new terms, allowing it to train its AI models on data collected since 2007.  Musk’s criticism of the deal is the latest development in an ongoing spat with OpenAI, which he helped co-found alongside the current CEO Sam Altman and three others in 2015. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 following a disagreement with the company’s leadership team over its future.   Read More: Inside Elon Musk’s Struggle for the Future of AI In February 2023, three months after the launch of ChatGPT, Musk criticized OpenAI, writing that it had become a “ maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.” The following month, Altman called Musk a “jerk” on journalist Kara Swisher’s podcast, but also said he believed the Tesla CEO cared about AI and the future of humanity. Later that month, Musk was among the more-than 30,000 signatories to an open letter that called for a pause to training AI system’s larger than OpenAI’s GPT-4. Although the letter did not succeed in convincing top AI labs like OpenAI to halt these activities, it did highlight the growing concern over the potential risks posed by artificial intelligence. In July 2023, Musk revealed his own artificial intelligence company, xAI. In November, it began previewing its own chatbot, Grok, to select X Premium users. In March 2024, xAI released Grok-1, an open-source AI model and xAI has subsequently raised $6 billion. That same month, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman, alleging that they had violated the company’s founding principles by putting profit over benefiting humanity. OpenAI responded by releasing a trove of emails that show Musk supported the creation of a for-profit entity. OpenAI has denounced the court case, calling it “incoherent” and aimed at advancing Musk’s “commercial interests.” "
74,Harry Booth and Tharin Pillay,A Timeline of All the Recent Accusations Leveled at OpenAI and Sam Altman,https://time.com/6986711/openai-sam-altman-accusations-controversies-timeline/,"The release of OpenAI's latest model has been somewhat overshadowed by a series of accusations leveled at both the company and its CEO, Sam Altman.",2024-06-07T17:46:45Z,"Recent weeks have not been kind to OpenAI. The release of the company’s latest model, GPT-4o, has been somewhat overshadowed by a series of accusations leveled at both the company and its CEO, Sam Altman. Accusations range from prioritizing product development over safety to using the likeness of actor Scarlett Johansson’s voice without her consent. This comes at the same time that several high-profile employees, including co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, have chosen to leave the company.  This is not the first time the Silicon Valley startup has been embroiled in scandal. In November, Altman was briefly ousted from the company after the board found he had not been “consistently candid” with them. He returned five days after being removed, with the support of most staff. The board was subsequently reconstituted, and Altman was reappointed to it in March. As AI systems of the sort developed by OpenAI become increasingly powerful, they carry the potential for both tremendous benefits and serious risks. For example, many experts believe that they could be used to enable large-scale criminal or terrorist activities. Meanwhile, OpenAI says its mission is to build “artificial general intelligence” (AGI)—a speculative technology that could perform almost all economically valuable tasks better than a human—in a way that benefits “all of humanity.” Recent events have cast doubt on whether the company can be trusted to act responsibly in pursuit of this lofty goal, and have led many to underscore the need for regulation in the AI sector. Here is a timeline of all the recent accusations leveled at OpenAI and Sam Altman. After resigning from OpenAI on May 15, Jan Leike explained his decision in a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), writing “safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Leike departed on the same day as OpenAI’s chief scientist Sutskever. The pair co-led the “superalignment” team, the newest of OpenAI’s three safety teams. While the company’s other safety groups focused on the risks posed by AI systems in the short-to-medium term, the superalignment team was established in July 2023 to devise ways of controlling hypothetical future AI systems. Leike said that for months the team had been “sailing against the wind” and struggling to access the computing power needed for its research—despite OpenAI promising the team a fifth of its total computing resources. Days later, multiple sources confirmed to Fortune that OpenAI had failed to keep its commitment. The superalignment team had also lost at least three staff since March, two of whom were fired for allegedly leaking information. With co-leaders Leike and Sutskever no longer there to take the helm, the superalignment team was disbanded. Altman responded by saying he was grateful for Leike’s contributions and acknowledging there was a lot more safety work to be done. In a follow-up post, Altman and OpenAI’s President, Greg Brockman, laid out their vision going forward, saying “we take our role here very seriously and carefully weigh feedback on our actions.” Leike has since announced that he has joined rival AI lab Anthropic to “continue the superalignment mission.” On May 17, Vox reported on the existence of “extremely restrictive offboarding agreements” used by OpenAI to stifle criticism. In order to retain the vested equity that employees had accrued, they were reportedly required to sign an agreement containing both non-disparagement provisions that would eternally forbid them from criticizing their former employer, and non-disclosure provisions that prevented them from mentioning the agreement’s existence. This came to light after one former employee, Daniel Kokotajlo, posted to an online forum about his refusal to sign. In a series of posts shared on X, Kokotajlo said: “I told OpenAI that I could not sign because I did not think the policy was ethical; they accepted my decision, and we parted ways.” The next day, Altman took to X to deny any knowledge of these provisions, stating, “this is on me and one of the few times I've been genuinely embarrassed running OpenAI; I did not know this was happening and I should have.” Altman also said in the same post that they had never clawed back anyone’s equity, and did not intend to. OpenAI subsequently confirmed, in messages sent to current and former employees, that these provisions would no longer be enforced, and that they would remove the offending language from all exit paperwork going forward. The messages were reviewed by Bloomberg. The credibility of Altman’s denial was called into question when, on May 22, leaked documents appeared to show his signature, as well as the signatures of other senior executives such as OpenAI’s chief strategy officer Jason Kwon and chief operating officer Brad Lightcap, on documents that explicitly authorized the provisions.  Read More: The Scarlett Johansson Dispute Erodes Public Trust In OpenAI When OpenAI demoed its latest model,GPT-4o, which responds to speech in real-time in a human-like voice, many were struck by how familiar one of the voices (“Sky”) sounded. Listeners thought Sky’s voice was similar to that of Samantha, played by Johansson, from the 2013 science-fiction film Her. A few days before the GPT-4o’s demo, Altman tweeted “her,” and on his personal blog he wrote that interacting with the model “feels like AI from the movies.” On May 20, Johansson shared a statement saying that she was “shocked, angered, and in disbelief” that Altman would use a voice so similar to her own without her consent. She explained that Altman approached her several times trying to hire her to voice GPT-4o, which she declined. The actor says she was approached again two days before the release of the demo, asking her to reconsider. In a response posted to the OpenAI website, Altman stated: “The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers. We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn’t communicate better.” The law is unclear on whether hiring an actor to imitate another actor’s voice amounts to copyright infringement. Adding to the voices explaining their reasons for resignation, on May 22 AI policy researcher Gretchen Krueger, who resigned on May 14, said that OpenAI “need[s] to do more to improve foundational things like decision-making processes; accountability; transparency; documentation; policy enforcement; the care with which we use our own technology; and mitigations for impacts on inequality, rights, and the environment.” When OpenAI’s board fired Altman last November, they offered a somewhat-cryptic explanation of their decision, saying he was “not consistently candid in his communications with the board and the broader OpenAI team.” After more than 700 of OpenAI’s roughly 770 person team threatened to follow Altman to Microsoft if Altman was not reinstated, he was brought back as CEO—and two of the board members who called for his dismissal stepped down.  The law firm WilmerHale subsequently carried out an investigation into the circumstances and found “that his conduct did not mandate removal.” But the board members who were pushed out remained tight-lipped about their side of the story.  That changed on May 26, when former board members Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley published an op-ed in The Economist where they accused Altman of “lying” and engaging in “psychological abuse” against some employees, including senior-level ones who had gone to the board with their concerns. OpenAI’s novel corporate structure—it is a capped for-profit company ultimately controlled by a nonprofit—was intended to enable the board to act decisively if they felt the company was failing to uphold its original mission of acting in the best interests of humanity. But according to Toner and McCauley, Altman made the board’s role difficult by neglecting to share key information. Toner elaborated on this point on the TED AI Show, explaining that Altman had not disclosed that, until April, he legally controlled the OpenAI Startup Fund, instead repeatedly telling the public he had no financial stake in the company. The board was also not informed prior to the release of ChatGPT, which would go on to become the company’s flagship product. Toner also said Altman gave false information about the company’s formal safety processes on multiple occasions, and that he had tried to push her off the board after she published a research paper that he disagreed with. She concluded that OpenAI’s experiment in self-governance had failed, urging for regulatory oversight. Four days later, two current OpenAI board members, Bret Taylor and Larry Summers, rejected the claims made by Toner and McCauley, describing Altman as “highly forthcoming.” They insisted OpenAI is a leader on safety, and cited WilmerHale’s internal investigation, which concluded that Altman’s dismissal was not over safety concerns. Read More: Two Former OpenAI Employees On the Need for Whistleblower Protections On June 4, 13 current and former employees from advanced AI companies—11 from OpenAI, and two from Google DeepMind—published a letter decrying the lack of accountability in AI companies, and calling for stronger whistleblower protections.  The letter notes that “AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,” and that its authors do not believe that “bespoke corporate structures” are sufficient to address this. It goes on to argue that, in the absence of effective government regulation, company employees are the only ones capable of holding these companies to account when they engage in risky behavior. The ability of employees to do this is hampered by the widespread use of confidentiality agreements in the industry. One signatory to the letter, alignment researcher Carroll Wainwright, elaborated on X, saying: “I worry that the board will not be able to effectively control the for-profit subsidiary, and I worry that the for-profit subsidiary will not be able to effectively prioritize the mission when the incentive to maximize profits is so strong.” The letter calls on AI companies to commit to not enter into legal agreements that restrict employee’s abilities to criticize them; to facilitate the anonymous reporting of concerns to company boards, governments, or an appropriate independent organization; to support a culture of open criticism; and to commit to not retaliating against employees in cases where they share confidential information with the public, and other reporting procedures have failed. In a response sent to the New York Times, a spokesperson for OpenAI said: “We’re proud of our track record of providing the most capable and safest A.I. systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology, and we’ll continue to engage with governments, civil society and other communities around the world.” Google DeepMind did not comment on the letter. Some OpenAI employees have been critical of the letter. Joshua Achiam, a research scientist at the company, said on X that the letter “disrupts a delicate and important trust equilibrium that exists in the field and among AGI frontier lab staff today.” In particular, Achiam argues that allowing safety researchers a wide discretion to decide whether disclosing confidential information to the public is justified undermines trust within labs in a way that is ultimately bad for safety. In an interview on the Dwarkesh Podcast, former OpenAI safety researcher Leopold Aschenbrenner explained the events that led to his dismissal from the company, and criticized the company in the process. He said he first received a formal warning for sharing an internal memo with OpenAI’s board, in which he criticized the security measures the company had taken to protect “model weights or key algorithmic secrets from foreign actors” as being insufficient. The action that ultimately led to his dismissal was, Aschenbrenner claims, relatively innocuous. Per his account, he shared a document he’d written on safety, that had been scrubbed of sensitive information, with external researchers for feedback. Aschenbrenner says this was “totally normal at OpenAI at the time.” However, leadership at OpenAI felt that the document leaked confidential information pertaining to their plan to develop AGI by 2027/2028. Aschenbrenner alleges that this information was already in the public domain; indeed, Altman told TIME a similar timeframe during an interview in 2023. Aschenbrenner was a researcher at OpenAI’s now-disbanded superalignment team. He was not the only superalignment team member to leave from the company prior to co-leads Sutskever and Leike’s departure. Per an update shared on his LinkedIn profile in May, researcher Pavel Izmailov now works at AI lab Anthropic. Meanwhile, William Saunders resigned from OpenAI in February. Ryan Lowe, another alignment researcher at the company, left in March. It suggests that friction between the superalignment team and OpenAI’s leadership had been brewing for months before reaching breaking point earlier in May, when co-leaders Sutskever and Leike resigned."

The employees, who filed suit in a California state court, detailed their complaints in a 2022 open letter to management they shared via a company intranet. The next day, four of the plaintiffs were fired, they alleged; others were terminated later after an internal investigation. In January, the federal National Labor Relations Board filed its own complaint against SpaceX based on issues raised by nine fired employees. Among other workplace concerns, the open letter called on executives to condemn Musk’s public behavior on X—the platform then known as Twitter—and to hold all employees accountable for unacceptable conduct. Musk’s actions included making light of sexual harassment allegations against him—charges that the billionaire denied. “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX—every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company,” the open letter said at the time. The letter also referred to Musk’s actions as a “frequent source of distraction and embarrassment.” The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages. The complaint drew connections between Musk’s behavior—in particular, his often lewd posts on Twitter—and the working environment at SpaceX. It states that one of the plaintiffs, Yaman Abdulhak, noted that many of the inappropriate examples cited in a 2021 “appropriate behavior” employee training “closely resembled the contents of Musk’s tweets.” Abdulhak sent examples of those tweets to the SpaceX human resources director, who took no action, the complaint stated. SpaceX did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment."
76,LINDSEY BAHR / AP,"Sony Pictures Acquires Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, the Dine-In Movie Theater Chain",https://time.com/6988026/sony-pictures-acquires-alamo-drafthouse-cinema/,"Sony Pictures Entertainment has acquired the distinctive theater chain Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, the companies said Wednesday.",2024-06-12T21:15:22Z,"Sony Pictures Entertainment is getting into the exhibition business. The studio behind recent films like “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” and “The Garfield Movie” has acquired the distinctive theater chain Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, the companies said Wednesday. Included in the deal is the genre film festival Fantastic Fest. Sony said it will continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors at the dine-in theaters. Alamo Drafthouse was founded in 1997 as a single screen, family-owned repertory theater in Austin, Texas, and has grown to 35 locations in North America. It distinguished itself in the exhibition landscape with drinks, dine-in food service and a cool vibe that became a favorite of cinephiles. “We are beyond thrilled to join forces with Sony Pictures Entertainment to expand our company vision to be the best damn cinema that has ever, or will ever, exist now in ways we could only ever dream of,” Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League said in a statement. “They have a deep respect and understanding of cinema’s ability to both drive growth and create lasting cultural impact which aligns perfectly with everything Alamo Drafthouse stands for.” For Sony, the Drafthouse acquisition is also tied into its experiences initiatives, including its Wheel of Fortune Live! Traveling tour and the Wonderverse space in Chicago. Ravi Ahuja, the president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, also noted that the studio’s Crunchyroll films are particularly aligned with the interests of Drafthouse fans. Alamo Drafthouse has seen its ups and downs over the years. In March 2021, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, closed some locations and canceled plans to open new ones. Alamo emerged from bankruptcy at the end of May 2021, under the ownership of League, Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group. Michael Kusterman, a former executive at Caveman Foods, was named Alamo CEO. He will remain, heading the newly established Sony Pictures Experiences division and reporting to Ahuja, the statement said. Last year following the frenzy of Barbenheimer, employees at the Alamo Drafthouse in Manhattan and Brooklyn voted to unionize. Similar efforts were attempted at locations in San Francisco and Austin and were met with resistance from the leadership. For many years, Hollywood studios could not run movie theaters and control what was played on those screens following a landmark antitrust Supreme Court case in 1948 that outlawed practices like “block booking,” in which studios required theaters to book a bundle of their films. Each of the major studios entered into a consent decree with the Department of Justice, known as the Paramount Consent Decrees, which required the major studios that owned theaters at the time to either divest distribution operations or their theaters. Conflicts between Hollywood studio business practices and the federal government go back to the early 1920s, over concerns about vertical integration and the monopolization of film production and distribution. In the 1930s and 1940s, most first-run movie theaters had only one screen. Distribution and exhibition have undergone vast changes since the days of the Paramount Consent Decrees, including the proliferation of multiplex theaters that show films from different exhibitors throughout the day and the advent of television, home video and streaming. The separation mandate officially went away in 2020 when the Paramount Consent Decrees were terminated. Now Netflix, for instance, owns several theaters in New York and Los Angeles, and the Walt Disney Co., which was not part of the original “big eight” in the 1940s, owns and operates the El Capitan in Los Angeles. Movie theater chains have also stepped outside their lane recently, with artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute their concert films."
77,Alana Semuels,Defrauded? Banks May Not Give Your Money Back,https://time.com/6987981/banks-check-fraud/,A legal loophole may leave banking customers vulnerable to check and wire-transfer fraud,2024-06-13T11:00:00Z,"In Nov. 2021, John William Pollard, a retiree who lives in Philadelphia, wrote a $84.83 check to Verizon to pay a phone bill. It was stolen in the mail. The amount was changed to $45,678.12, made out to a person named Olivia Wallace, and cashed, according to a legal complaint made on behalf of Pollard and his wife Patrice.  The Pollards had just deposited a large sum into their Wells Fargo bank account, with which the check was written. So they didn’t immediately realize the money was missing from their account. It wasn’t until Verizon notified the couple that it hadn’t received the phone payment that the Pollards say they noticed the fraud and reported it to Wells Fargo, in early 2022.  More than two years later, the Pollards still haven’t gotten any of the stolen money back from the bank.  Wells Fargo says it has no obligation to return the money. It alleges in a letter to the Pollards that they did not report the stolen check until more than two months after it was deposited. The bank says it informs its customers that they “must file a timely claim for any suspected fraudulent transactions on their account,” within 30 days of a fraud or forgery event. Courts have determined that banks can shorten the amount of time customers have to report check fraud to as little as two weeks.  The case, which is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania, highlights a legal loophole that consumer lawyers say leaves banking customers vulnerable to check and wire-transfer fraud. Consumers are protected from fraud in many electronic transactions by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), which gives people 60 days from when they received their statement to report unauthorized transactions. But checks and wire transfers fall outside the EFTA, and are instead covered by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a set of laws governing U.S. commercial transactions.  The UCC says that consumers have a year to report check fraud. But it also allows such terms to be changed “by agreement,” which essentially means that banks can shorten the grace period as they see fit. They do that by informing customers that the terms of their banking agreement are changing, and give customers the option of closing their account if they don’t agree to the new terms. Many customers do so without even reading the terms of the changes. (Who has the time to read 40 pages of a bank-deposit user agreement?) But with a simple click, customers can gut their own protections against fraudulent transactions. (Wells Fargo says that the 30-day reporting timeline in its deposit-account agreement hasn’t changed in more than 30 years.)  Some bank-account agreements shorten the grace period for reporting fraudulent transactions to 14 days from when your bank statement was transmitted. All the UCC says is that changes to the user agreement shouldn’t be “unreasonable,” and courts have determined that 14 days is reasonable, says Carla Sanchez-Adams, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.  As a result, customers can find themselves out of luck when they report that money was fraudulently taken from their account. Many people do not closely monitor the transactions in their online banking accounts, or look at the checks they’ve written. “Unfortunately people aren’t checking their accounts as often as they should,” says Sanchez-Adams, “so they don’t find out about it until after the time period in the account agreement.”   Read More: Banks Aren't Doing Enough to Protect Consumers From Scams. Changes to bank deposit account agreements are common—many banks have used them to restrict customers’ ability to settle disputes in court, instead mandating arbitration. (Three-quarters of banks use account agreements to mandate arbitration, one Pew analysis found.) Banks’ decision to shorten the grace period comes as the incidence of check fraud grows in the U.S. In Feb. 2023, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an alert to national financial institutions to alert them to a rise in check fraud. In 2022, financial institutions filed 680,000 Suspicious Activity Reports to FinCEN to report potential check fraud, nearly double the previous year.   The Pollards say that Wells Fargo should have caught the fraudulent check in the first place and notified them. They say they had never written a check for any amount close to $45,000, and so the bank should have flagged the transaction.  The Pollards allege that Wells Fargo initially told them they would get their money back. But in August 2023, the bank told the couple that they hadn’t notified the bank of the fraud within 30 days of their Jan. 2022 account statement, and therefore had forfeited any claim for the return of their cash. “If the customer does not report any issues within that time, the bank account statement is deemed to be correct, and the customer approves all the transactions,” the bank’s senior counsel wrote in a letter.  In a statement provided to TIME, Wells Fargo says that it understands the frustration that victims feel after a fraud incident, and that it tries to raise awareness around fraud and scams. However, the bank says, “we inform all our customers that they must file a timely claim for any suspected fraudulent transactions on their account,” and that the banking industry follows an established process for helping customers reclaim funds.  Read More: Why We're Spending So Much Money. Larry Smith, a consumer lawyer based in Illinois, says customers don’t even need to have bank checks to be vulnerable to check fraud. Smith says his client, Rogelio Arroyo, had an account with Fifth Third Bank that did not include personal checks. But in December 2021, a scammer somehow got Arroyo’s account number, made up fake checks, and stole $14,000 from Arroyo’s account, Smith says. The forgeries were very crude: in one case, the check number differed on the same piece of paper. Yet Arroyo hasn’t recovered a cent from Fifth Third, according to a pending legal complaint made in Illinois, where Arroyo lives. (He was traveling out of the country when the alleged fraud occurred.)  “It’s becoming a greater fallacy that you’re protected by putting your money in a bank,” Smith says.  Fifth Third said in a statement to TIME that it is “committed to helping customers who have experienced fraud” but that its account rules require customers to notify the bank of issues or disputes in a timely manner. The bank told Arroyo that it would not conduct any investigation because he did not dispute the fraudulent transactions within 30 days, according to the complaint. (The bank says it does not comment on active litigation.)  Consumer advocates are pushing for more protections over check fraud, including changing what is covered under the EFTA. In Jan. 2024, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Citibank, alleging that it has failed to protect users from scams, costing New Yorkers millions of dollars. The complaint argues that wire transfers should be covered under the EFTA.  Citi did not return a request for comment. Citi told Reuters that the lawsuit would “abruptly and dramatically upset how banks have organized their policies and practices for decades.” If James wins, the case would be a “game changer” for customer safety, says Smith.  Read More: 11 Ways to Get Free Financial Advice. In the meantime, consumer advocates are pushing for the EFTA to include wire transfers and checks. But it’s not clear consumers would necessarily benefit from a change, because the laws are so complex that few people know their rights when they’re battling banks. “It’s extremely complicated for an unsophisticated consumer to know what protects me, and what law applies,” says Sanchez-Adams.   It’s something that anybody who has battled with a bank knows well. Patrice Pollard has sent notarized statements back and forth to Wells Fargo and dealt with countless customer representatives; she keeps every piece of paper in case she needs it. “They really get you thinking you are crazy,” she says. Her husband opened the bank account in 1999, at a different bank, which then merged into Wells Fargo. Despite the ongoing lawsuit, they still have their retirement funds and other money at the bank. When their case is resolved, Pollard says, the couple will pull out every dime and put it somewhere else.  “Some friends have suggested a credit union,” she says. “But there’s always the old shoe or sock.” "
78,Ayesha Javed,"Bill Ford on Revitalizing Michigan Central Station, the Future of Detroit and EV Politics",https://time.com/6986735/bill-ford-interview/,"Ford Motor Company's Bill Ford spoke with TIME about what the Michigan Central project means for Detroit, the auto company’s future, and what he’s learned about leadership.",2024-06-09T11:00:00Z,"Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor Company, partly credits his experience in Silicon Valley with helping him come up with a plan to restore Detroit’s Michigan Central Station. The 111-year-old Beaux-Arts building, designed by the same firm that did New York City’s Grand Central Station, had fallen into disuse after closing in the 1980s, becoming a symbol for the city’s decline—something Ford had long wanted to change.  Ford, a great-grandson of the automaker’s founder, Henry Ford, served on eBay’s board in the early 2000s and later went on to found a venture-capital firm to invest in the future of mobility. “I was acutely aware of all the vitality, all the startup energy, and all the funding available for new ideas in the Valley—and I would come back to Michigan and see none of that happening,” he says. “I couldn't even get anybody in our industry or our company interested in what was going on in Silicon Valley.” While his firm, Fontinalis Partners, found plenty of prospects in the Bay Area, Austin, and even overseas, Ford says they struggled to find Michiganian companies to invest in.  When he spoke about the changes the industry needed to make during a TED talk in 2011, it wasn’t well-received in the auto industry. “People thought I was crazy,” he says, noting that much of what he’d said the industry needed has since come to pass, such as advances in connected car technology. “It really enforced the fact that we had become an insular company, in an insular industry and an insular town, and that the future was not going to be created here unless there was a concerted effort to do that.”  One part of that effort is now coming to pass: Ford Motor Company bought the abandoned train station in 2018, kicking off a massive preservation project that aims to make the century-old building the centerpiece of a 30-acre technology and cultural hub. On June 6, Michigan Central celebrated its reopening with a concert featuring Motown legend Diana Ross and rock star Jack White, executive produced by rapper Eminem. Ford spoke with TIME on May 17 about what the project means for Detroit, the auto company’s future, and what he’s learned about leadership. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.  On a visceral level, the reason I got involved is because I remember the train station as a young boy. And then I remember very vividly, as my life progressed, the train station just being a wreck; it was often the visual that accompanied a national story about the decay of Detroit. I hated both the fact that the nation was looking at our city the way it was, and also the fact that that was always the visual. And so in the back of my mind, I always was saying to myself, if I'm ever able to think of a reason to take the station over and revitalize it, I would love to. But I could never really come up with a business reason.  One day I was driving by and [it] just clicked in my head and I said, “What if we could reimagine Michigan Central, not as a wonderful trip down memory lane, but also as the place where people come together to make the Motor City the Motor City again, where the future of mobility is worked on.” That's why I bought the Book Depository building next door, which is up and running and has 97 startups already in it. Half of those startups are from the Michigan area. The other half are or not, which is great. So we're bringing talent here. [At] Michigan Central, from a work standpoint, we'll have bigger companies like Ford, like Google—these startups will be able to collaborate with them to work on a lot of these interesting things. We can use Michigan Avenue as a really interesting testbed for all kinds of different experiments. The FAA has granted us the airspace, so we can play with [vertical take-off and landing aircraft] solutions and drones and how they connect with vehicles, and how they connect with robots. We have an inductive charging street now, so when you drive your EVs, it'll charge as you drive. We have 20 venture capital companies now in the Book Depository building, so this whole flywheel—[in] which you need all those pieces to have a healthy, innovative ecosystem—is starting to be put together down there.  For most of my life, Detroit was in decline. I am old enough to remember Detroit before the ’67 riots. Prior to that, everything I did was in the city. My pediatrician, my dentist—everything was there. And then the riots happened and you have many, many, many years then, of not only white flight, but frankly, white versus Black, suburb versus city. There was no collaboration really in the region. The city was shrinking. This last census, we're growing again, which is awesome. I think there's been so much positive energy in Detroit in the last six or seven years. Our midtown area has been redeveloped. We had the NFL Draft here a couple of weeks ago. There were no incidents and I think the country could see Detroit in a different light. So, in many ways, it will be the exclamation point for the rebirth of our city, because the station itself is going to be a really fun gathering spot. We'll have art, we'll have music, we'll have coffee shops. We were [also] very intentional about connecting it to everything else. Roosevelt Park, which is out in front, has been completely redone and it’s very pretty. We have a new Greenway in downtown Detroit. We're building a lot of bike paths and pedestrian areas and [planting] tons and tons of trees. And we're also at the intersection between two iconic neighborhoods that have always been divided—Corktown and Southwest Detroit.  Well, our commitment to Detroit has never wavered for 120 years and it won't. Just look at Detroit—you've got things like the Henry Ford Health System, the Detroit Institute of Arts, Ford Field; I redid the Rouge, the Henry Ford Museum. We've been invested as a family in Detroit for many, many, many years and this is kind of doubling down on that and that won't change. We will always support our hometown. I've always believed that a company that isn't making people's lives better shouldn’t exist, and part of that is taking care of the communities in which you operate. So that won't change at all. And we are the most American company—we make the most vehicles here, we employ the most Americans [of any automaker], and I'm very proud of that. And I've also never thought of our employees as, “UAW or white collar.” To me, we're all just Ford employees, and I've got a tremendous relationship with our union employees. I really cherish those relationships. But the business realities, which both the UAW leadership and ourselves have to deal with, sometimes lead us to [make] decisions that short-term may not look like the most wonderful, but long-term, they always work out. Look, 120 years later, we're still here, we're growing, and we've been adding jobs in the last six, seven years. I think, interestingly, in some ways Silicon Valley is as insular, in its own way, as our industry was—but on the very positive side, there was a belief that anything was possible, that smart people could imagine the future and that they could find people to back them on that journey. I found that really compelling, very exciting, and in many ways, it was like the days when my great-grandfather founded Ford. But we had lost that here in Michigan and in our industry, and in our company. I was determined to get that back. Because, if we didn't, the future would not be created here. You only need a couple things to be a really good leader, I think you need to have a very strong set of values and live those values. And you have to be authentic, and you can't try and be anybody else, because I think most people have a great BS detector. [Often] somebody gets put into a higher position and they believe they have to change. Well, everybody who knows that person sees that immediately and they lose all credibility. I've seen leaders who are introverts, I've seen leaders who are extroverts. I've seen leaders who are kind of egocentric. I've seen leaders who are very selfless. But the one thing they all have in common is they're genuine.  And admit your mistakes and learn from them. I still see a lot of people in important positions who portray themselves as infallible. Well, that's not possible and I think that really stops you from learning. It's ever-changing. Several years ago, we divided our businesses into: Ford Blue, the combustion engine business; Ford Model e, which is our electric vehicle business; and Ford Pro, which is our commercial-facing business. And that really shines a spotlight, like on Ford Model e, you can actually see exactly where the gaps are. A lot of companies will hide that. But for us, there's tremendous clarity. Now there's a bit of pain in that because everyone can say, “Oh, wow, you guys are losing X per vehicle.” Yes, we are, and we can't go on like that.  We made a decision a few years ago in our internal combustion engine [ICE] business, to focus on our really highly emotional products—Bronco, Raptor, Mustang, Ranger. They’re selling out and people love them. Then we also made the decision to invest a lot in hybrids.  The one thing I've learned in my career is, we can know directionally where things are going, but we can never know timelines. Our research shows the people who have bought EVs, they're heavily intentional to buy another EV for their next vehicle. The charging infrastructure certainly has to get better and that's a pain point for a lot of EV customers. And then the price to the customer has to come down dramatically. But I think both of those things will happen.  We've just got [a] choice for everybody, so we're not shoving anything down anybody's throat. If you want an EV, great. We're the number two seller in the U.S. of EVs. If you want hybrids, that may be a wonderful transitional technology to get you ultimately to full EV and if you want an ICE vehicle, we've got those too, so I feel like our strategy is the right one. The timeframe is unknown. Because we never could have in our wildest dreams imagined our vehicles, i.e. EVs, becoming political hot potatoes, like they are today. There’s no question in Washington you tend to have different conversations depending on who you're talking to. Some people say “why can't you make more of them” and others say “why are you making them, because we just got energy-independent as a country?” But the reality is, the fact that we have something for everybody allows the temperature to come down in those conversations and then allows a more thoughtful discussion about, where should we go as an industry, what does it take to get there? What kind of technology is needed? Do we have the right American supply base to deliver that technology? My experience has been that the path that we've chosen—which is basically we're not forcing anything on anybody and the customer will decide—tends to almost take all the emotion out of the discussion, and then you can get into the mechanics. I think everybody's crystal balls are necessarily cloudy. You have some people saying we're heading for a soft landing. Other prominent leaders, like Jamie Dimon, say maybe not. Our demand is still pretty strong right now but we're aware that credit card delinquencies are rising and there's some things we're looking very closely at. We're in an election year. The one thing that hurts us as a company and our industry is when things go from pillar to post from a policy standpoint. Our lead times are long. We have to build prototypes, we have to make sure they're safe, we have to make sure the supply chain at every step is ready to go. So what helps us is clarity in terms of where we're headed from a policy standpoint. I hope we can have that as we go forward, because we can live, in time, with lots of different policies—but what we cannot do is react in a very short-term way."
79,Ashley Carman / Bloomberg,Songwriters Association Files FTC Complaint Against Spotify Over Royalties,https://time.com/6988114/spotify-songwriters-ftc-complaint-royalties-audiobooks-bundle/,The NMPA alleges that Spotify’s decision to bundle audiobooks in its subscription resulted in reduced royalty payments to songwriters.,2024-06-13T03:30:00Z,"The National Music Publishers’ Association, a trade group that represents music publishers and songwriters, filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday about Spotify Technology SA’s decision to provide audiobooks to subscribers, which resulted in reduced royalty payments to songwriters.The audiobooks addition gave Spotify leeway to reclassify its premium subscription offering as a “bundle.” Under a complicated system set by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board, that qualifies Spotify to pay a discounted rate to songwriters since it’s now paying for the licensing of books and music under the same subscription price. The NMPA alleges in its complaint that the bundle is unlawful since subscribers were automatically rolled in, with no option to remain on a music-only tier, which doesn’t yet exist in the U.S.  Payments to songwriters could drop by around $150 million over the next year as a result, according to the NMPA. “This bait-and-switch subscription scheme is ‘saddling’ shoppers with recurring payments for products and services they did not intend to purchase or did not want to continue to purchase,”  the NMPA said in a letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan. “If allowed to continue, Spotify’s conduct will cost consumers millions of dollars, undermine the music royalty system, and harm competition.”The NMPA also sent its complaint to 10 state attorneys general, including those in New York, Tennessee, California and Illinois, as well as several consumer advocacy groups, in an attempt to encourage state investigations and possibly class action lawsuits. A spokesperson said Spotify’s approach to offerings and prices is standard in the industry. “We notify users a month in advance of any price increases and offer easy cancellations as well as multiple plans for users to consider,” the spokesperson said. “In short, we categorically reject the NMPA’s baseless accusations.”  Spotify’s bundling move has put it at war with music publishers. The Mechanical Licensing Collective, a royalty collection service, sued the streaming service over the issue last month. The group is asking a federal court in Manhattan to order Spotify to stop classifying premium subscriptions as a bundled service and to pay for lost revenue. In response to the lawsuit, Spotify said it looks forward to a “swift resolution,” over terms that publishers and streaming services “agreed to and celebrated years ago.” Separately, the NMPA also sent a cease-and-desist letter last month over products it claims are infringing on songwriters’ copyrights. The NMPA alleges music videos, lyrics and podcasts on the platform use copyrighted music without the proper permissions. “Before Spotify’s ‘bundling’ betrayal, we may have been able to work together to fix this problem, but they have chosen the hard road by coming after songwriters once again,” David Israelite, chief executive officer of the NMPA, said in a statement at the time. A Spotify spokesperson called the May letter a “press stunt filled with false and misleading claims.”"
80,Simmone Shah,Meet the Friends Buying Houses Together,https://time.com/6987131/buying-homes-with-friends/,More Americans are bucking traditional notions of homeownership and buying property with platonic friends.,2024-06-10T15:34:31Z,"When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Eve Ettinger realized something needed to change. Stuck working remotely in a rented farmhouse in rural Virginia, they felt isolated and yearned for community and support. “I wanted to have a housing situation that was more focused on long term stability and sustainability,” says Ettinger, 35, who uses they/them pronouns.  A friend of Ettinger’s had recently divorced and was looking to start over, and the two began to toy with the idea of purchasing a house together. “We wanted to divest from the compulsive heteronormative idea that you make your family and your stability out of romantic relationships,” says Ettinger. “We wanted to make an intentional community living situation where we could be there for each other in a bigger picture way.” They purchased a home in northern Virginia in 2021 that they now share with a few friends. The move has allowed Ettinger, a writer who also works at a nonprofit, to build financial stability that had long felt out of reach.   A generation ago, most Americans would have never considered the idea of buying a home with a friend. But that’s changing, as many millennials and members of Gen Z no longer view the traditional markers of stability—marriage, children, and a white picket fence— as an inevitable or even desirable goal. A record number of young adults are marrying later or not at all, and growing numbers are choosing not to have kids. Broader economic factors, like high inflation, increased cost of living, and stagnant wages, are making saving up for a home even more challenging. More than 12 million Americans spend at least half of their paycheck on rent, and housing prices in 99% of U.S. counties are unaffordable for the average wage earner, according to data from real estate data provider ATTOM.   Entering the housing market on a single income can be difficult, which is why married couples still make up the largest percentage of home buyers in the U.S.. But many increasingly believe that the benefits of homeownership—the number one driver of wealth in the United States—should not be limited to those in romantic relationships. That’s why more people are choosing to purchase a home with close friends instead. The data supports the idea that buying a home with friends is becoming a bona fide trend in the real estate market. A recent survey from JW Surety Bonds found some 15% of Americans have gone in on a home with someone other than a romantic partner. Open House Austin, a real estate company focused on helping homebuyers move away from traditional ideas of homeownership, says that the number of co-buyers they serve has jumped from 5% in 2021 to 16% in 2023. The HGTV series House Hunters is even devoting an upcoming episode to the practice.  Alex Reyna has always wanted to be a homeowner, but the process felt impossible without a partner—especially living in Austin, a city in which housing prices have skyrocketed after tech companies flocked to the region during the pandemic. “I would tell my mom, ‘It's just so hard not being dual income,’” Reyna, 35, says. “If I have somebody to pay half my mortgage it'd be a whole different story.“ When a friend began to look into moving to Austin from Washington, D.C., she approached Reyna with the idea of pooling their resources and purchasing together. They were able to buy a home in May with the help of Open House Austin. Neither of the women view the house as their ‘forever home,’ but rather a way for them both to build their own financial stability. “I have spent so much of my life living paycheck to paycheck,” says Reyna, who runs her own business managing short-term rentals. “Not only does this put us in a house, but it's also building something for our future and I think that was massive for both of us.”  Read More: Stop Looking for Your Forever Home While the trend of buying homes with friends is becoming more mainstream, it’s hardly a new concept in the queer community. “It’s something that people have been doing for a long time because they had to,” says AnnieRose Shapiro, a real estate agent in Portland, Oregon. “Queer [people] who had a longtime romantic partner could not buy a home as a married couple.”  Now the practice is catching on with others out of financial necessity. “The housing market right now is, by historical measures, unaffordable,” says Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. Buyers face prohibitively high prices and mortgage rates that are higher than they’ve been in decades. The percentage of homes in the market affordable to those making the median income in the U.S. has dropped from 50% in 2013 to 16% in 2023, according to Redfin data. Teaming up to buy a home can decrease costs by 40 to 60% per bedroom, says Matt Holmes, co-founder of CoBuy, an app that provides resources to help individuals throughout the co-buying process.  Still, while it can help cover costs, there are unique challenges that come with buying a house with a friend instead of with a spouse. Heath Schechinger saw that for himself when he chose to co-buy a home with friends in Northern California in 2021. “We all had our own reservations about the nuclear family model of moving to the suburbs and feeling isolated and trying to raise a family by ourselves,” says Schechinger, 40, adding that regular rent hikes made them eager to purchase instead. “We all wanted to be able to eventually be a homeowner, so that we had the autonomy of making choices for our own, but living in the Bay Area that just seems so financially out of reach for all of us.”  But Schechinger and his friends, who used CoBuy to help navigate the home-buying process, quickly learned that the process was not designed for multiple, unrelated buyers. “In all of the forms that we filled out, there were only two names that we could include, and we were constantly having to write in one of the other people,” he says.  “All of the systems that we built to facilitate and enable homeownership [including] financial, legal, and tax frameworks are all catered to a married couple,” Holmes says.  Across the country, housing inventory and laws reflect this. While multi-generational and multi-family homes are common in many parts of the world, the majority of homes built in the U.S. are single-family dwellings, according to the Center for American Progress. Many cities in the U.S.—including Stephenville, Texas and Providence, R.I.— prohibit three or more unrelated adults from living together. Some couples are even getting involved to make their own home search more affordable: a CoBuy survey found that one in five groups that were teaming up to co-own a house included a married couple in the group. Read More: How Easy Lending Can Lead to Fraud Andy Sirkin, a lawyer who specializes in real estate co-ownership, says that he encourages co-buyers to draft up an operating agreement that breaks down what the agreement will look like from start to finish—including an exit strategy, property management, and default.  Before purchasing their home, Reyna and her friend created an agreement that covers possible exit scenarios—including if one of them hopes to move in with a romantic partner or buy the other’s share of the property. For Ettinger, who purchased a home with a friend who earned more than them, the agreement also included “sweat equity”—the responsibilities and contributions to a home that might not be monetarily defined. “What I would pay in rent goes to equity, which I can pull up if I leave, and the rest I contribute through labor that's invested in making this place better and improving the standard of living for everybody,” says Ettinger.  Sometimes the obstacles remain too great to overcome. Schechinger and his friends recently decided to sell their home, in part because their mortgage agreement prohibited them from transferring the mortgage to a non-family member when someone was hoping to transition out of the arrangement.  Still, Schechinger is determined to try again. He describes his ideal home: a house with separate wings to allow for privacy, with shared spaces that foster connection. He views it as an antidote to the loneliness epidemic, a world in which friends might share the responsibilities of raising children or household responsibilities. “In the past, there were clear structures where people could rely on each other for support, whether it was caring for aging parents or helping with child rearing, or even finding a partner,” says Schechinger, a psychologist and co-founder of the Modern Family Institute, a research-based organization focused on expanding legal and social definitions of family. ""This network provided a sense of security and mutual assistance that is no longer the case today."" He believes living situations that prioritize friendship and community will only continue to grow in popularity—especially as people look to build their own safety net in the absence of larger societal protections. “The social and economic pressures,” he says, “are too high for people to not consider it.” Correction, June 11 The original version of this story misstated the name of an app that helps people buy homes together. It is CoBuy, not Co-Buy."

82,CHRISTOPHER MEGERIAN and SYLVIE CORBET / AP,Biden Apologizes to Zelensky For Congressional Holdup to Weapons That Let Russia Gain,https://time.com/6986575/biden-apology-zelensky-congressional-holdup-weapons-russia-gain/,U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday for the first time publicly apologized to Ukraine for a monthslong congressional holdup.,2024-06-07T12:39:05Z,"PARIS — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday for the first time publicly apologized to Ukraine for a monthslong congressional holdup in American military assistance that let Russia make gains on the battlefield, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for bipartisan U.S. support “like it was during World War II.” Speaking in Paris, a day after they both attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, Biden apologized to the Ukrainian people for the weeks of not knowing if more assistance would come while conservative Republicans in Congress held up a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine for six months. Still, the Democratic president insisted that the American people were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. “We’re still in. Completely. Thoroughly,” he said. The apology — and Zelenskyy’s plea for rock-solid support akin to the allied coalition in WWII — served as a reminder that for all of Biden’s talk of an unflagging U.S commitment to Ukraine, recalcitrance among congressional Republicans and an isolationist strain in American politics has led to Russian gains on the battlefield. And, although unremarked upon, the specter of Donald Trump’s candidacy loomed over the discussion, as the Republican former president and the presumptive nominee has spoken positively of Russian President Vladimir Putin and sparked Ukrainian concerns that he would call for it to cede territory to end the conflict. Zelenskyy pressed for all Americans to support his country's defense against Russia's invasion, and he thanked lawmakers for eventually coming together to approve the weapons package, which has allowed Ukraine to stem Russian advances in recent weeks. “It’s very important that in this unity, United States of America, all American people stay with Ukraine like it was during World War II,” Zelenskyy said. ""How the United States helped to save human lives, to save Europe. And we count on your continuing support in standing with us shoulder to shoulder.” The United States is by far Kyiv’s biggest supplier of wartime support, and Ukraine is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. The push is focused on the Ukrainian border regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk, but Ukrainian officials say it could spread as Russia's bigger army seeks to make its advantage tell. The offensive is seeking to exploit Kyiv’s shortages of ammunition and troops along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line. The slow pace of delivery of pledged Western weaponry has long frustrated Zelenskyy, as has Biden’s hesitation over supplying more hardware for fear of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. That has caused tension in their relationship. The U.S. will send about $225 million in military aid to Ukraine, Biden announced Friday. The latest package includes munitions for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, as well as mortar systems and an array of artillery rounds, U.S. officials said Thursday. Biden cast the additional aid in his meeting with Zelenskyy as money to “reconstruct the electric grid” in Ukraine, a reference aides said was to additional air defense and missile defense systems in the new package. Easing their stance amid Russia's most recent onslaught and with Ukraine's army reeling, some NATO allies including the U.S. said last week they would allow Ukraine to use weapons they deliver to Kyiv to carry out limited attacks inside Russia. That step brought a furious response from the Kremlin, which warned that Europe's biggest conflict since World War II could spin out of control. Biden and Zelenskyy attended the anniversary events of D-Day in Normandy, northern France, on Thursday, along with European leaders who have supported Kyiv’s efforts in the war. Biden pledged “we will not walk away” from Ukraine, drawing a direct line from the fight to liberate Europe from Nazi domination to today’s war against Russian aggression. Ukraine depicts its fight against the Kremlin's forces as a clash between Western democratic freedom and Russian tyranny. Russia says it is defending itself against a menacing eastward expansion of the NATO military alliance. In a 20-minute speech Friday at the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, Zelenskyy drew a parallel with the sacrifices made during World War II and his country's current fight. “This battle is a crossroads,"" Zelenskyy said. ""A moment where we can now write history the way we need it. Or we can become victims of history as it suits … our enemy.” Zelenskyy, who spoke in Ukrainian, was frequently interrupted by lawmakers’ applause and cheers. He prompted a standing ovation when he said in French: “Dear France, I thank you for standing by our side as we defend life.” French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, announced late Thursday that France will provide Ukraine with its Mirage combat aircraft. Macron has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine. He said in February that putting Western troops on the ground in Ukraine is not “ruled out.” Zelenskyy began a day of meetings in Paris with an official welcome ceremony at the golden-domed Invalides monument, site of Napoleon’s tomb. During the day, Zelenskyy was due to visit the Nexter arms manufacturer in Versailles, which makes the Caesar self-propelled howitzers that are among the weapons provided by France to Kyiv’s forces. He was also to meet with Macron at the Élysée Palace. Zelenskyy’s foreign trips aim to keep Ukraine’s plight in the public eye, secure more military help for its fight against Russia’s invasion and lock in long-term Western support through bilateral alliances. France and Ukraine in February signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement. Zelenskyy has since signed similar bilateral agreements with many European countries."
83,Anna Gordon,These Are the Children of U.S. Presidents That Have Had Run-ins With the Law,https://time.com/6987924/presidents-children-run-ins-law-hunter-biden/,Here is a list of all the children of modern presidents who have found themselves in legal trouble.,2024-06-12T17:49:43Z,"On Wednesday, Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, when a twelve person jury found him guilty of lying on a government background check about his history with substance abuse in order to buy a gun in 2018. President Biden released a statement on Wednesday expressing support for his son but nevertheless promising to respect the court’s decision. ""As I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad,"" the president said in his statement. ""Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction… As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal."" But Hunter isn’t the only child of a U.S. president to have encounters with the law. Here is a list of all the children of modern presidents who have found themselves in some legal trouble.  Over a decade before his father was elected president in 2016, Donald Trump Jr., age, was arrested for public intoxication in downtown New Orleans. The dates of Trump Jr.’s arrest align with Mardi Gras, a Christian holiday in which people celebrate and consume rich and fatty food before the fasting season of Lent. Trump Jr. was arrested in the evening and spent 11 hours in jail before being released on a $300 bond.  In a 2004 interview with New York Magazine, Trump Jr. admitted that he “used to drink a lot and party pretty hard.” He told reporters that he struggled to drink in moderation, ultimately leading him to decide to cut back on alcohol. “About two years ago, I quit drinking entirely. I have too much of an opportunity to make something of myself, be successful in my own right. Why blow it?” he said.  Twin sisters Jenna and Barbara Bush, the daughters of president George W. Bush, were both cited for underaged drinking while their father was in office.l  While Jenna Bush was a freshman at the University of Texas, she was cited for two misdemeanors within the span of five weeks in 2001. The first was for possession of alcohol as a minor and the second was for attempting to use a fake ID to buy alcohol at a restaurant. She pleaded no contest for the first misdemeanor and was ordered to pay $51.25 in court costs, spend eight hours doing community service, and spend six hours taking alcohol awareness classes. For her second misdemeanor, she was ordered to pay $600 and her drivers’ license was suspended for 30 days.  Similarly, Barbara Bush also ran into trouble with alcohol while she was a student at Yale University. In 2001, she pleaded no contest to a possession of alcohol charge and was ordered to attend an alcohol awareness class, complete eight hours of community service, and pay $100 in court fines.  Neil Bush, the fourth child of president George H.W. Bush and brother of president George W. Bush was sued by federal regulators in 1990 for serving on the board of a financial institution called Silverado Savings and Loan that collapsed in 1988. They accused him of engaging in business deals that should have been flagged as conflicts of interest while he was on the board of directors, ultimately contributing to the institution's collapse.  The collapse of Silverado cost taxpayers over a billion dollars. Neil ultimately settled the lawsuit outside of court and agreed to pay $50,000 but was not indicted on any criminal charges. ""I regret that the institution's failure cost taxpayers so much money,” he wrote in a 2003 email to the Washington Post.  Michael Reagan, the adopted son of president Ronald Reagan and his first wife Jane Wyman was accused of violating California securities laws in 1981. A Los Angeles County District Attorney said that he had promised to invest money on the behalf of investors in the stock market without being officially registered as a securities salesman as required by law. He was ultimately cleared of the charges later that same year.  Amy Carter, the daughter of president Jimmy Carter, has had multiple run-ins with the law due to her involvement in political activism. In 1985, she was arrested for participating in an anti-apartheid demonstration in front of the South African embassy Washington D.C. according to the New York Times. She was just 17 at the time and protested with her father’s permission. ''This is a fundamental wrong being committed,'' she said, in reference to South Africa’s apartheid laws at the time. ''This is the first hurdle to overcome in fighting it.'' Carter was arrested a second time in 1987 in anti-CIA protests at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Protestors occupied an administrative building to protest the presence of a CIA recruiter on campus. When police began arresting some of the protesters, Carter and other activists sat down in the road to block the buses carrying the arrested students from passing through. Carter and the other protesters were subsequently arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct, though they were ultimately acquitted in a jury trial five months later. "
84,Philip Elliott,Hunter Biden Owned His Actions. A Jury Punished Him For Taking Responsibility,https://time.com/6987519/hunter-biden-verdict-addiction/,Hunter Biden's efforts to hold himself accountable for his recovery were used against him in court. It's a terrible model for other former addicts.,2024-06-11T18:51:48Z,"This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. As Joe Biden was preparing for his first debate against Donald Trump over the summer of 2020, staying largely secluded in his Delaware home as he and the country marathoned through the Covid-19 pandemic, he looked down to see his son, Hunter, calling. Hunter told the man he called “Pop” that he knew the younger Biden’s struggle with drugs and alcohol were certain to come up when he faced the then-President Trump. Hunter Biden was direct: he knew what he had stared down, appreciated the challenges of staying sober, and understood that staying silent on his demons was not going to make them any less lethal. All the while, the junior Biden reminded the elder what is often left unsaid: tens of millions of families across the nation faced the same struggles as the Bidens, replete with stints in rehab, cruising through blackouts, and stretches of complete withdrawal from loved ones. Addiction is a tormentor that cares little about adjoining credentials, after all. Joe Biden, the patient father, had little to say in those pre-debate days. So much of it had been said already through the years of Hunter Biden’s troubles that left him booted from the Navy and his home, kicked at his lowest and beyond, and made into a pariah or punchline by his father’s enemies. But the former Vice President understood the assignment, nodded along, and made clear that this part of his family brief wasn’t one for focus groups or workshopping. “My son, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,” Joe Biden said in measured tones when he met with Trump, then the incumbent White House resident with a job Biden had coveted since the days of eight-tracks. “He’s overtaken it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him. I’m proud of my son.” It was about as solid a defense as possible, disarming Trump as his planned attack on the Biden family’s suitability for continued public life flopped. It fit the model of the Biden family’s posture when it came to the Hunter saga in recent years: honesty, accountability, recovery. On Tuesday, a federal court in Delaware found that Hunter Biden’s bracing honesty and efforts at holding himself accountable for his recovery were not sufficient grounds to exonerate him of a felony crime. Relying in no small measure on Hunter Biden’s own admissions made in his shockingly honest memoir, Beautiful Things, a jury decided that the junior Biden was guilty on all three criminal charges on the table in this, the first of at least two criminal cases against him. The fact that Hunter Biden recorded an audiobook of the confessional made it all the easier for prosecutors to leave it to the jury to judge in the son-of-privilege’s own voice. The development was a stunning turn for a Georgetown and Yale Law graduate who took his life sideways while battling addictions. The core of the case against Hunter Biden was that Biden had lied on a federal form in 2018 when asked if was on drugs or addicted to them when he legally purchased a Colt .38 revolver. Prosecutors said Hunter Biden knowingly lied on the form, citing a text message to a lover—and then some.  ""I can be sober, but I'll always be an addict,"" Hunter Biden wrote to one sexual partner. Defense lawyers said it was rhetoric common to recovery programs, not an admission that he was addicted to drugs and thus being untruthful on his federal gun application. That 12-step branding didn’t work for jurors. Other embarrassing details emerged in open court, including an account of Hunter Biden’s drug-buying patterns, his sex life, and his chaotic existence blazing through one bad choice after another. Unlike his memoir, which was honest but couched in his recovery, the unspooling of the tape in court with regard to his private life left much less of a sympathetic silhouette.  The whole trial made public the very messy lives of the Biden family in the years between Joe Biden’s two terms as VP and his White House run in 2020. For instance, prosecutors called Hunter Biden’s late brother’s widow and then his lover Hallie Biden, who testified that she found the gun in his unlocked truck, chucked it into a trash can, and then was unable to recover it. CCTV from the shopping center parking lot backs up part of the story, including a forager who found the gun and took it. Oh, and the bag she used to toss that gun in the first place? It seemed to have cocaine in it. For their part, the defense lawyers were left arguing a narrow rejoinder: because Biden was not actively using drugs at the time he filed his gun paperwork, he was technically telling the truth. In evidence, no one testified that they witnessed Hunter Biden using cocaine or crack cocaine or similar substances in the weeks leading up to the gun purchase. Still, defense lawyers decided against offering Biden as a witness, realizing that he was far from a sympathetic figure after his dead brother’s widow-turned-his lover and his daughter alike told unflattering moments of his experiences, not to mention the various characters who corroborated that Biden’s unyielding addiction was its own shade of hell.  The verdict came quickly. The jury began deliberations on Monday after lunch, and they took three hours to decide the younger Biden’s fate before midday on Tuesday. The judge didn’t set a sentencing date, but that usually comes in about four months. Lost on no one: Election Day in slightly less than five months from today, and the family patriarch wields the power of federal pardon. (President Biden says he will not avail himself of the privilege, although much can be made of that debate as he heads toward Election Day or beyond.) Still, this much has to be said: Hunter Biden, in his memoir and limited public interviews and then in his silent court scolding, took responsibility for his actions while struggling with his addictions, usually at the cost to his very public family and often at the expense to his close circle of loved ones. He worked the steps of personal recovery in a manner that most addicts weather in private. He took ownership of his choices—and had them thrown back at him in federal court. None of which absolves him, but if the public health and consequences of such rebuilding efforts are to be judged by what comes next, hurling such attempts at self-awareness back via public recriminations might be worth a second look at whether they serve the community, the victims, or the defendant in the best possible way. Undoubtedly that will be a factor under consideration in Hunter Biden’s sentencing, as it should be. The younger Biden’s allies may argue that it should also give Joe Biden and his team at the White House ample justification to consider a pardon or commutation, to set an example here for what might be best modeled for other addicts. The President’s political acumen will likely keep him away from such action, but his sudden jump up to Delaware after the verdict suggests he’s listening to his gut and to his family.

85,CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY / AP,Nevada’s Plan to Expand Electronic Voting Raises Concerns for Election Security Experts,https://time.com/6987235/nevada-electronic-voting-raises-concerns-for-election-security-experts/,"Under the plan, tribal members in Nevada who live on a reservation or colony can receive a ballot electronically.",2024-06-10T20:23:37Z,"Schurz, Nevada — Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe have watched the boundaries of their land recede over time along with the waters of the lake that are central to their identity, threatening the cultural symbol that gave the tribe its name — Agai Dicutta, or Trout Eaters. Not wanting to cede their voice, tribal leaders have been making a push for expanded voting rights. That effort includes filing a lawsuit on behalf of all Nevada tribes seeking polling places on tribal lands and access to early voting. “Tribes shouldn’t have to keep filing lawsuits just to vote on their own lands,” said Elveda Martinez, 65, a tribal member and longtime voting advocate. “It should be more accessible.” The state has now granted the Walker River Paiutes and other tribes in Nevada a new right that advocates hope will greatly expand voting access for a community that gained U.S. citizenship only a century ago. Voting on reservations across the country has historically been difficult, with tribal voters sometimes having to travel dozens of miles to their polling place. Slow mail service and lack of a physical address, common on tribal lands, have proved challenging. The new process — the ability to cast ballots electronically — has the potential to significantly boost turnout among all tribes in Nevada. But what some see as a small measure of justice to equalize voting rights raises security concerns for others, with implications far beyond Nevada's 28 tribal communities as the nation braces for what is expected to be another close and contentious presidential election in November. Under the plan, tribal members in Nevada who live on a reservation or colony can receive a ballot electronically through an online system set up by the state and then return it electronically. Experts warn that such voting — when a completed ballot is sent back either by email, through an online portal or by fax — carries risks of ballots being intercepted or manipulated and should be used sparingly, if at all. “At this point in the United States, it’s a relatively small number of ballots that are coming through that way,” said Larry Norden, an election expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “But we should be very concerned — both from actual security risks but also from a public confidence point of view — about expanding this.” While electronic voting may be limited at the moment, it’s available across much of the country to specific groups of voters. More than 30 states allow certain voters to return their ballots either by fax, email or an online portal, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures and Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that studies state voting systems. In most cases, electronic ballot return is available only to U.S. military and overseas voters. But it’s been expanded in recent years to include voters with disabilities in a dozen states. Nevada is believed to be the first to add tribes. Cal Boone, the new tribal outreach coordinator for the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office and a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, has begun meeting with tribes around the state to share details about the process, which he believes could ease a legacy of barriers that has left some reluctant to vote. “In past years, tribes didn’t have access to vote in multiple ways. You had to rely on the mail system to cast your vote or otherwise drive out to great lengths to vote,” Boone said. “What we are seeing in Nevada is really powerful, and it really sets the stage for what other states throughout the country can be doing to help support tribes."" But the solution comes with risks. In a 2020 memo to election officials, the FBI and other federal agencies assessed the risk of sending ballots electronically to be low, but allowing those ballots to be returned electronically was high. The memo highlights recommended security practices for internet-connected systems, including isolating computers that handle electronic ballots from ones that are used for other aspects of voting. ""The information provided should be considered a starting point,"" the memo states. ""Even with these technical security considerations, electronic ballot return remains a high-risk activity.” Earlier this year, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is charged with helping protect the nation’s election systems, said in an online post that the memo was being redistributed to ensure state officials and policymakers are “fully informed of risks” associated with electronic ballot return. Susannah Goodman, director of election security for Common Cause, is among those concerned that there are no federal guidelines for such systems and no independent reviews, unlike what's in place for voting machines and ballot tabulators. An attempt to create independent standards ended in late 2022 after a group of experts determined it wasn't possible at the time given the technology and cyber risks. Kim Wyman, the former top election official in Washington state, initially supported electronic voting as a military spouse, but said she grew wary after taking over as secretary of state. Her attempt to persuade lawmakers to repeal it was unsuccessful. Wyman said she worries something could happen to the ballot in transit and what that would mean for public confidence in elections. She believes the safest bet is for voters who receive ballots electronically to print them out and return them by mail. “Election officials are in a hard spot because they want to provide accessibility and they want to make sure that every eligible American has a right to participate in an election,” Wyman said. “But they have to do it in a way where they’re also securing those ballots and making sure that that voter’s ballot is counted the way the voter cast it.” Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said he knows the process carries risks, but sees everything related to elections as having some risk. He pointed to the federal government's action in 2017 to designate the nation’s voting systems as critical infrastructure, just like dams, banks and nuclear power plants. The state’s electronic ballot return system was designed by the state with security measures intended to verify eligibility, authenticate voters and their ballots, and ensure secure communications, he said. There are steps to ensure voters are not casting multiple ballots, and the system undergoes regular security reviews and updates. “I’m confident in our system,” Aguilar said. He expressed frustration about what he described as a lack of national leadership on this and other election issues, saying there should be less criticism and more work and funding to address concerns. “The federal government has access to so many experts, they have access to resources. They should be providing a leadership position to give us a path forward,” Aguilar said. “To think backward and to scare us is not the appropriate way to do this.” So far, few Nevada voters have opted in. As of Friday, 255 voters had submitted a ballot electronically — none of them tribal members — ahead of Tuesday's primary. More than half of those were registered in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and is the state's most populous. “Folks that participate find it very convenient and very easy to use,” Clark County Registrar Lorena Portillo said. Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, just over 2,500 voters returned their ballots electronically through the state system. Among them was Ramona Coker, who is blind. Coker said she no longer needs help to vote and can cast a ballot on her phone, which is equipped with screen-reading technology allowing her to follow audio prompts to make her selections. “It feels very American. It feels like you have done your part and no one else has had an influence in that,” said Coker, who works for a Reno-area nonprofit. She believes the challenges faced by voters with disabilities outweigh the potential risks of electronic balloting. “We’re always going to have bad-faith actors out there, no matter what delivery form or what return form that we use,” Coker said. “And if you’re always worried about that, then you never cast a vote again.” States led by both Democrats and Republicans have authorized electronic ballot returns, with varying rules. Alaska, California, Florida and Oklahoma limit the process to military and overseas voters and only permit electronic return by fax. In Texas, astronauts can use an online portal to cast their ballots. In West Virginia, first responders on duty outside their county also are eligible. “Having been in the military, I’ve seen intelligence transmitted via the internet. We transmit nuclear codes via the internet,” West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said. “If we can do that, we can certainly get a secure ballot and transmit across the internet.” Not all states have embraced the practice. In Minnesota, officials considered it but ultimately decided against it. “In light of recent security concerns, it’s on ice,” said Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon. “Someday -- if those security considerations are addressed and if the concerns and objections of the federal agencies can be overcome -- we would definitely consider it because as a matter of convenience, it would probably make a difference.” The Walker River Paiute reservation is along a scenic stretch of highway between Las Vegas and Reno, about two hours south of the state capital in a vast stretch of desert surrounded by distant mountain peaks. On a late spring day, sprinklers prepare alfalfa fields that dot the reservation while wild horses graze in nearby foothills. There are no grocery stores, restaurants or hotels, and the nearest town is about 30 miles away. Although the tribe has long had its own polling location — something other tribes in the state have not — the reservation's remoteness has sometimes added to a sense of political isolation. Some tribal members have not always seen the point in voting. “Because of the historical abuses our people have faced, we were very timid to even take part in voting or elections,"" tribal Chair Andrea Martinez said. ""For many years, we didn’t feel like our voice even mattered.” The prospect of casting ballots electronically is a step Martinez and other tribal leaders welcome, but they're not sure it will make a major difference, at least initially. Internet access is spotty on the reservation, as is electricity because of aging utility poles. “Although we, through the state, can access online voting, who knows if we’ll even have electricity or internet that day?” Martinez said. Teresa McNally, who oversees the election office in Mineral County, which includes the Walker River reservation, plans to hold a meeting with tribal members this year to explain the new system. One thing she wants to emphasize is the focus on security, including the measures protecting the electronic ballot return system. “What it takes to even get into our internet system here, it’s crazy,” she said. Courtney Quintero, a tribal member and chair of the board overseeing tribal elections, said she planned to use the new system once she learned more about it, but acknowledged others may be hesitant. “Trust is a big thing with our community,"" she said."
86,AYANNA ALEXANDER and MATT BROWN / AP,"Most Black Americans Believe U.S. Institutions Are Conspiring Against Them, a Pew Poll Finds",https://time.com/6987227/black-americans-u-s-institutions-are-conspiring-against-them/,A study released Monday by the Pew Research Center examined the intersection of race and conspiratorial beliefs,2024-06-10T19:42:32Z,"Washington — Most Black Americans say they’ve experienced racial discrimination regularly or from time to time, which colors how they view U.S. institutions like policing, the political system and the media, according to a study on conspiracy theories. The study released Monday by the Pew Research Center examined the intersection of race and conspiratorial beliefs. It's the second installment in the research group's series on how Black Americans see success and failure. The study defines racial conspiracy theories as ideas that Black Americans might have about “the actions of U.S. institutions"" that aren't necessarily the stated goals of the institution. The study stresses that these are claims that Black Americans may have because of America's documented history of racist policies largely impacting Black communities. Pew examined claims including conspiratorial beliefs about how major institutions discriminate against Black Americans and support for generational adages such as “you have to work twice as hard"" to advance compared with white Americans. For instance, the study found that more than 8 in 10 Black Americans surveyed agreed with the statement that “Black people are more likely to be incarcerated because prisons want to make money on the backs of Black people.” And more than 6 in 10 Black adults surveyed agreed that institutions such as the criminal justice system, the country's economic system and policing are designed to hold Black people back. Those sentiments exist alongside a reality that Black people were 32% of sentenced state and federal prisoners in 2022, even though they make up just 12% of the overall U.S. population. By comparison, white people were underrepresented among prisoners at 31%, while Hispanic people were slightly overrepresented at 23% of prisoners, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Pew's study draws from a poll of Black Americans conducted last September. Study authors say that views are unlikely to have shifted since the respondents were surveyed. The study also explored why Black adults believe these narratives and allowed respondents to explain how they feel about discrimination and racial disparities in their own words, said senior Pew researcher and study author Kiana Cox. She added that although the survey was released during an election year it does not focus on partisan politics. Rather, it showcases the feelings Black Americans have that can influence how the community views the nation but often go unheard or aren’t taken seriously. “There are anecdotal conversations among Black people about the system, the Man, the invisible hand, the agenda that is set out to create a situation where Black people can’t advance. So, we wanted to explore that,” Cox said. “We also wanted to figure out how many Black people are familiar with these narratives about the system being designed for their failure and how many Black people believe them."" Americans are far from impervious to conspiratorial thinking dating back to the founding of the nation, a legacy that has gained new life as the internet supercharged communication and, often, the spread of misinformation and hoaxes. The Pew study notes that Black Americans have a unique relationship with both discrimination and claims of government conspiracy theories given the nation's legacy of slavery, Jim Crow era segregation laws and modern day discrimination against Black Americans by public and private actors. “When you have a history of American institutions actually conspiring against Black people, it’s not so hard to believe that anything else would also be true,” said Tasha Philpot, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Austin, who studies political psychology among Black Americans. “Especially in the last few years where race has been pretty salient, it doesn’t surprise me that people would say they are experiencing racial discrimination,” she said. Among Black adults who have experienced discrimination, about three-quarters said it made them feel as though the system as a whole was designed to keep them down. Black adults who have faced discrimination also felt varying emotions as a result — 76% felt angry overall, 53% said they worried about their personal safety, and 41% felt depressed, for example. Researchers surveyed 4,736 Black, multiracial Black and non-Hispanic, and Black and Hispanic respondents last September from across the country. Black Americans were also likely to believe racial conspiracy theories about politics. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they agreed that “Black public officials being singled out to be discredited more than white officials” happens in politics today. In medicine, the survey found that 55% of those surveyed said they agreed with the statement that “medical researchers experiment on Black people without their knowledge or consent.” Philpot said some Black Americans may still believe such theories, given documented episodes of discrimination such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the exclusion of Black Americans from New Deal programs that benefited white Americans. “It's not really a conspiracy theory if it's true,” she said."
87,TERRY SPENCER / AP,Florida Law Blocking Gender-Affirming Care for Transgender Children is Struck Down By Federal Judge,https://time.com/6987671/florida-law-blocking-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-children-struck-down/,A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a 2023 Florida law that blocked gender-affirming care for transgender minors.,2024-06-11T23:35:20Z,"Fort Lauderdale, Fla. — A federal judge on Tuesday struck down a 2023 Florida law that blocked gender-affirming care for transgender minors and severely restricted such treatment for adults, calling the statute unconstitutional. Senior Judge Robert Hinkle said the state went too far when it barred transgender minors from being prescribed puberty blockers and hormonal treatments with their parents' permission. He also stopped the state from requiring that transgender adults only receive treatment from a doctor and not from a registered nurse or other qualified medical practitioner. And he barred a ban on online treatment for transgender adults. Hinkle said transgender people are constitutionally entitled to the legitimate treatment they need and, quoting the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., compared those who oppose it to those who were once against equality for minorities and women. “Some transgender opponents invoke religion to support their position, just as some once invoked religion to support their racism or misogyny,” Hinkle wrote in his 105-page decision. “Transgender opponents are of course free to hold their beliefs. But they are not free to discriminate against transgender individuals just for being transgender. “In time, discrimination against transgender individuals will diminish, just as racism and misogyny have diminished,” he continued. ""To paraphrase a civil-rights advocate from an earlier time, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office blasted Hinkle’s ruling, issuing a statement calling it “erroneous,” and vowing to appeal. “Through their elected representatives, the people of Florida acted to protect children in this state, and the Court was wrong to override their wishes,” the statement said. “As we’ve seen here in Florida, the United Kingdom, and across Europe, there is no quality evidence to support the chemical and physical mutilation of children. These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror.” But those who sued the state celebrated the decision. Lucien Hamel, a transgender adult, issued a statement saying, “I’m so relieved the court saw there is no medical basis for this law — it was passed just to target transgender people like me and try to push us out of Florida.” “This is my home. I’ve lived here my entire life,"" he said. “This is my son’s home. I can’t just uproot my family and move across the country. The state has no place interfering in people’s private medical decisions, and I’m relieved that I can once again get the healthcare that I need here in Florida.” A mother of one of the children who sued said, “This ruling means I won’t have to watch my daughter needlessly suffer because I can’t get her the care she needs.” “Seeing Susan’s fear about this ban has been one of the hardest experiences we’ve endured as parents,” said the woman. She was identified in court documents only as Jane Doe and her daughter as Susan Doe to protect their privacy. “All we’ve wanted is to take that fear away and help her continue to be the happy, confident child she is now.” DeSantis had signed the law last year as he was gearing up for a presidential campaign that was highly based on culture wars. “We never did this through all of human history until like, what, two weeks ago? Now this is something?” he told cheering supporters as he signed the bill. “They’re having third graders declare pronouns? We’re not doing the pronoun Olympics in Florida."" At trial, Florida’s attorneys had conceded that the state cannot stop someone from pursuing a transgender identity, but said it can regulate medical care. For minors, the only treatments at issue are puberty blocking treatments and cross-sex hormones — giving testosterone to someone assigned female at birth, for example. Those who were undergoing treatment when the law was adopted in May 2023 were allowed to continue. Surgery, which is rare for minors, was still blocked. For adults, treatment was still allowed but could only be done by a physician instead of an advanced practice registered nurse or other professional. It required the patient to sign a consent form in person while in the same room with the doctor, meaning the treatment couldn’t be done on a video call or otherwise online — something not normally required with other medical procedures. Violators could be charged criminally and medical providers could lose their licenses. Hinkle wrote that Florida had long allowed treatment for gender dysphoria, the feeling that one’s gender identity does not match one’s sex as registered at birth. “But then the political winds changed,” Hinkle wrote. He was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1996. For 99% of people, Hinkle wrote, their biological sex and their gender identity are the same. But for a few, they differ. Hinkle said the state admitted that during the trial, even if some won’t believe it and think transgender people are making a choice like “whether to read Shakespeare or Grisham.” “Many people with this view tend to disapprove of all things transgender and so oppose medical care that supports (it),” he said. He said even though the state concedes it cannot constitutionally block people from identifying as transgender and presenting themselves as they wish, several legislators made it clear in their comments that this was their goal. At least 25 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. The only other one to be struck down so far as unconstitutional is the ban in Arkansas, which the state has appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Advocates are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Judges’ orders are in place temporarily blocking enforcement of a ban in Montana and aspects of the ban in Georgia."
88,Brian Bennett and Nik Popli,What Trump Told Republicans During His ‘Joyful’ First Visit to Capitol Hill Since Jan. 6,https://time.com/6988505/what-donald-trump-told-republicans-meetings/,"Trump met with members of Congress in his first trip to Capitol Hill since Jan. 6, and urged them to adopt his current position on abortion.",2024-06-13T21:02:56Z,"When Donald Trump hosted meetings with Republicans in Congress on Thursday, it was the first time the GOP nominee for President had been on Capitol Hill since his supporters stormed into the chambers by force on Jan. 6, 2021 to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. A lot has happened since then. The Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. House Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy as Speaker. And Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in a New York courthouse. There was much to talk about. Over the course of separate meetings with House members and Senators, Trump laughed about his conviction, praised current House Speaker Mike Johnson, and emphasized the need for Republicans to stay unified heading into November. He told Johnson’s frequent antagonist,  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, to be “nice” to the Speaker, eliciting laughter from every corner of the room, according to some in attendance. “It was a very joyful experience to have our leader back,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, the firebrand Florida Republican who led the motion to oust McCarthy as Speaker, tells TIME. Asked if Trump repaired the rift between Greene and Johnson, Gaetz says, “If he’s done that, we’ll send him to Gaza next.” During his meeting with Senators at the National Republican Senatorial Committee offices, Trump also appeared to “bury the hatchet” with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senators who have been critical of the former President, a senior Republican Senate aide told TIME. In March, McConnell endorsed Trump for President, despite having previously said Trump was “morally responsible” for the Jan. 6 riot. “I don't think Trump was taking shots at anyone,” the aide said. “I’m with them 1,000 percent. They’re with me 1,000 percent,” Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon after meeting with most Republican senators. “We agree on just about everything and if there isn’t, we work it out.” Trump's visit coincided with a failed effort by Democrats in the Senate to pass a bill affirming the right for women nationwide to access in vitro fertilization (IVF) amid a national debate over the popular fertility treatment after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are considered children. The Southern Baptist Convention this week suggested the government should “restrain” how IVF is used. Trump did not mention IVF in his meeting with House Republicans, lawmakers who attended the meetings told TIME, but he did emphasize that Republicans should unite behind his current position that decisions about abortion access should be left to the states. That stance is at odds with some of the GOP base, who are calling on Congress to pass a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions. “He just reminded us that it is a state issue,” says Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, tells TIME that he didn’t disagree with anything Trump said during the meeting, but pushes back somewhat on Trump's position to leave abortion to individual states. Burchett says he supports adopting a national ban on abortion as part of the Republican platform at the national convention in July. “It wouldn’t hurt my feelings one bit, but I don’t really think that’s going to happen right now,” he says. Trump told Republican lawmakers they would win more seats if they spoke about exceptions for rape and incest in some of the state abortion bans. But that’s not a message that will resonate with hard-line voters in Burchett’s district, he says. “He talked about states rights but he left it very open, ” adds Burchett. Republicans say that Trump spent the most time talking about the economy and criticizing the Biden Administration’s policies. “Trump was as energized as I’ve ever seen him,” Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina who originally backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the presidential primary, tells TIME of the meeting. “He laid out a vision of what he's gonna do… He's confident he's going to be reelected.” Trump told Fox News after his meeting with Senators that his running mate was “probably” in the room and that he would most likely unveil his pick during the Republican convention that starts on July 15. Punchbowl News reported that Trump mentioned Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio by name during the meeting and joked that Scott “wasn’t a good presidential candidate” but has been a “great surrogate for him.” Trump appeared to go slightly off topic during the House meeting, sources say, and at one point started ranting about crime rates. He called Milwaukee—where Republicans are holding their convention next month—a “horrible city.” Democrats quickly tore into Trump’s denigration of the biggest city in a pivotal swing state. “Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,” Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wrote on X, including the clown emoji.  At one point, Trump floated the idea of eliminating the U.S. income tax and replacing it with tariffs on imports, according to those who attended the House meeting. Norman says the tariffs were pitched as a way to even the playing field with China.  The former President also commented on the flotilla of Russian warships that reached Cuba on Wednesday. The surprising move by President Vladimir Putin was viewed by many as a show of force after the Biden Administration said that Ukraine could use U.S.-provided weapons near Kharkiv while attacking Russian forces. The Russian ships are not carrying nuclear weapons, but they are capable of launching some of Russia’s most highly touted missiles. Trump said such a display by Russia “would not happen with him” and that it’s a “very real threat,” according to Norman. When a Republican asked him about immigration and the border, Trump allegedly claimed falsely that there are “15 to 17 million” illegal migrants in the U.S. who are registered to vote. Trump vowed to deport them all. “I think he did the right thing,” Williams says, “by coming to where his base is and where his ambassadors will be—guys like me… He brought the whole team in. He gave everybody a pep talk, and I thought it was great. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, called Trump’s visit to the Capitol an attempt to get everyone who works in the building “to forget what that day was,” referring to Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the chambers in protest of President Biden’s election victory. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, spoke with TIME on his way to vote on the IVF measure. “Trump is an American citizen and he can come to the Capitol,” Warnock says. “The question is why are my Republican colleagues going over there at a moment when we’re trying to stand up for families and their ability to have children.” Republicans ultimately blocked the measure. Trump’s visit to the Capitol comes two weeks after a Manhattan jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to a sex scandal before the 2016 election, making him the first former President ever to be convicted of a crime. Congressional Republicans have blasted the verdict in an unprecedented and unified manner, claiming the prosecutor and judge were biased. Some have echoed Trump’s baseless suggestion that the Biden administration played a role in the prosecution. During his meeting with House Republicans, Trump didn’t appear too concerned about his felon status or his upcoming sentencing on July 11. “He laughed about it,” says Norman. “It has actually helped him.” Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who wrote that it was “bring your felon to work day” in response to Trump’s visit, told TIME that it’s “unimaginable” that Republicans who were in the Capitol on Jan. 6 would rush to attend Trump’s meeting. “It demonstrates, from my point of view…the hunger for power—that people could endure that assault and then rush to stand by him.” House Republicans began their meeting by singing “Happy Birthday” to the former President, who turns 78 on Friday, and by presenting him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game the previous night. Republicans beat the Democrats 31-11. “He told me, ‘I watched the baseball game…y’all played great,’” says Williams, who coached the Republicans to their fourth straight win. “He picked out a few players who he said could have done a little better.”"
89,SEUNG MIN KIM and REBECCA SANTANA / AP,Biden Faces First Lawsuit Over New Asylum Crackdown at the Border,https://time.com/6988081/biden-lawsuit-asylum-crackdown-border/,A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday over President Joe Biden’s recent directive.,2024-06-13T00:18:33Z,"Washington — A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday over President Joe Biden’s recent directive that effectively halts asylum claims at the southern border, saying it differs little from a similar move by the Trump administration that was blocked by the courts. The lawsuit — filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES — is the first test of the legality of Biden’s sweeping crackdown on the border, which came after months of internal White House deliberations and is designed in part to deflect political attacks against the president on his handling of immigration. “By enacting an asylum ban that is legally indistinguishable from the Trump ban we successfully blocked, we were left with no choice but to file this lawsuit,” said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the ACLU. The order Biden issued last week would limit asylum processing once encounters with migrants between ports of entry reach 2,500 per day. It went into effect immediately because the latest figures were far higher, at about 4,000 daily. The restrictions would be in effect until two weeks after those daily encounter numbers are at or below 1,500 per day, under a seven-day average. But it’s far from clear when the numbers would dip that low; the last time was in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The order went into effect June 5, and Biden administration officials have said they expected record levels of deportations. But advocates argue that suspending asylum for migrants who don’t arrive at a designated port of entry — which the Biden administration is trying to push migrants to do —- violates existing federal immigration law, among other concerns. “The United States has long sheltered refugees seeking a haven from persecution. The 1980 Refugee Act enshrined that national commitment in law. While Congress has placed some limitations on the right to seek asylum over the years, it has never permitted the Executive Branch to categorically ban asylum based on where a noncitizen enters the country,” the groups wrote in the complaint filed Wednesday. Biden invoked the same legal authority used by the Trump administration for its asylum ban, which comes under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision allows a president to limit entries for certain migrants if their entry is deemed “detrimental” to the national interest. As he campaigns, Biden has repeatedly criticized former President Donald Trump's immigration policies, and his administration argues that his directive is different because it includes several exemptions for humanitarian reasons. For example, victims of human trafficking, unaccompanied minors and those with severe medical emergencies would not be subject to the limits. “We stand by the legality of what we have done,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on ABC’s “This Week” before the lawsuit was filed, saying he anticipated legal challenges. In the lawsuit, the immigrant advocacy groups argue that exceptions are “extremely limited."" The White House referred questions about the lawsuit to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández defended Biden's order, saying in a statement it was necessary after congressional Republicans blocked a bipartisan agreement that ""would have provided critical resources, statutory changes, and additional personnel to the border."" Under Biden’s directive, migrants who arrive at the border but do not express a fear of returning to their home countries will be subject to immediate removal from the United States, within a matter of days or even hours. Those migrants could face punishments that could include a five-year bar from reentering the U.S. or even criminal prosecution. Advocates argued in the lawsuit that requiring migrants to express fear — often called manifesting fear — puts the onus on the migrants. “In practice, noncitizens who have just crossed the border, and may be hungry, exhausted, ill, or traumatized after fleeing persecution in their home countries and danger in Mexico, are likely to be intimidated by armed, uniformed Border Patrol officers, and are thus unlikely to ‘manifest’ their fear of return,” the lawsuit reads. Meanwhile, those who express fear or an intention to seek asylum will be screened by a U.S. asylum officer but at a higher standard than currently used. If they pass the screening, they can pursue more limited forms of humanitarian protection, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which prohibits returning people to a country where they're likely to face torture. Migrants who use an app called CBP One while they're in Mexico to schedule an appointment to present themselves at an official border crossing point to seek entry are exempt from these newer, tougher asylum restrictions. The app is part of the administration's efforts to encourage migrants to use its preferred pathways to try to enter the country, instead of simply crossing the border and finding a Border Patrol agent and turning themselves in. But in the lawsuit, advocates detailed a list of complaints about the app. For example, many migrants don't have a cellular data plan or the Wi-Fi access needed to use it. Some migrants don't speak one of the languages the app supports, while other migrants are illiterate. And there's only a limited number of slots available every day compared with the number of migrants who want to come into the country. “As a result, countless asylum seekers have been forced to wait indefinitely under precarious conditions in Mexico in the hope of obtaining scarce appointments,” the lawsuit reads. The other groups bringing the lawsuit alongside the ACLU were the National Immigrant Justice Center, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, Jenner & Block LLP, ACLU of the District of Columbia, and Texas Civil Rights Project."

The former congressman, currently facing federal fraud charges, has won a bid to make regular visits to the low-key Pennsylvania vacation destination after a judge on Tuesday granted his request to make excursions there. An attorney for Santos last week asked Judge Joanna Seybert if Santos could make weekly trips to the Mt. Pocono area, specifically to the town of Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania. Santos' travel is restricted as a condition of his release while he awaits trial. He is allowed to move within New York City, Long Island and Washington, D.C., as well as other trips provided he gives advance notice to the government, according to court records. The legal filing said Santos had already been cleared to visit the Poconos but wanted to make weekly trips there this summer without submitting frequent travel requests to the judge. A lawyer for Santos declined to comment on Santos' summer plans in the Poconos. Reached by text message, Santos declined to say what he was doing in the Poconos, but responded: “Slow news day?” Santos is facing a slew of criminal charges, including defrauding donors and lying to Congress. He has pleaded not guilty. Santos was kicked out of the House in December after an ethics committee report found “overwhelming evidence” of lawbreaking, making Santos just the sixth member expelled by colleagues in the history of the chamber."
91,Nik Popli,The Most Interesting Revelations in the Supreme Court Justices’ Financial Disclosures,https://time.com/6986825/supreme-court-justices-financial-disclosures/,"Financial disclosures for eight of the nine Supreme Court Justices were made public on Friday, revealing information about a gifted trip to Bali, free concert tickets to see Beyoncé, and nearly $1.6 million in book advances.",2024-06-07T21:25:53Z,"Financial disclosures for eight of the nine Supreme Court Justices were made public on Friday, revealing information about a gifted trip to Bali, free concert tickets to see Beyoncé, and nearly $1.6 million in book deals. The annual disclosures come as the court faces mounting pressure over its transparency and accountability measures, particularly concerning potential conflicts of interest and ties to affluent donors. A string of revelations in recent years about some of the Justices and undisclosed gifts has only intensified public scrutiny and raised questions about the impartiality of the judiciary. Justices are required to publicly disclose financial information each year to prevent conflicts of interest. Justice Samuel Alito was granted a 90-day extension to file his report, which he has also received in past years. Here are the most interesting tidbits from the Justices’ financial disclosures.  Justice Clarence Thomas acknowledged for the first time that he accepted luxury travel from Republican billionaire Harlan Crow for previously undisclosed trips he had taken in 2019 to Bali and a private all-male club in Northern California. The two trips were at the center of a ProPublica report last year exposing Thomas’ unreported luxury travel, triggering unprecedented scrutiny over the wealthy benefactors close to the Justices and their commitment to ethics rules. The story claimed that Thomas and his wife, Ginni, took lavish trips paid for by Crow, a Texas real estate mogul and Republican megadonor, almost on a yearly basis for over two decades without disclosing them.  According to the new disclosure forms, Crow and his wife provided food and one day of hotel lodging during Thomas’ trip to Bali in July 2019, and later paid for Thomas’ four-day stay at a private club in Monte Rio, California. Thomas explained in the document that the gifts from the Crows were “inadvertently omitted at the time of filing.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson disclosed that she accepted four free tickets worth $3,711.84 from pop superstar Beyoncé to one of her concerts last year. The disclosure form does not specify which concert the tickets were for, but a Supreme Court spokesperson confirmed the gift to The Washington Post and said: “Justice Jackson is Crazy in Love with Beyonce’s music. Who isn’t?” Jackson, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2022, also accepted two pieces of art worth $12,500 to display in her chambers. She had the most outside income of any Justice last year. Three Justices reported cashing in on book deals last year, totalling nearly $1.6 million in advances and royalties. Jackson reported the highest amount: an eye-popping $893,750 advance from Penguin Random House for her upcoming memoir, “Lovely One.” The book, which comes out in September, traces “her family’s ascent from segregation to her confirmation on America’s highest court within the span of one generation,” according to the publisher’s site. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is reportedly working on a legal memoir, disclosed that he received $340,000 from the conservative Regnery Publishing company. Justice Neil Gorsuch reported $250,000 in royalties from the publisher HarperCollins for his upcoming book, “Over Ruled,” which is slated to release in August. The book will examine the amount of laws in the U.S. and the “human toll so much law can carry for ordinary Americans,” according to the publisher’s site. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also reported about $87,000 in book royalties and was paid about $1,900 for her voice performance in the PBS Kids animated show Alma’s Way.  Large payments related to book deals have been somewhat controversial in the past. Supreme Court Justices, like other government officials, are only allowed to receive less than about $30,000 in outside income, but book income does not count toward that cap, allowing the Justices to enter into lucrative contracts with publishers about their lives and the law. Only Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan have so far not cut book deals."
92,Rebecca Schneid,Supreme Court Hands Activist a Loss for ‘Trump Too Small’ Trademark Attempt,https://time.com/6988415/supreme-court-rejects-trump-too-small-trademark/,The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the U.S. Trademark Office's rejection of the trademark application was not unconstitutional.,2024-06-13T19:58:34Z,"A labor lawyer’s brazen attempt to trademark the innuendo “Trump Too Small” was rejected by the Supreme Court on Thursday, who argued that the federal trademark office did not violate the man’s First Amendment when it rejected his trademark application. In a unanimous vote, the court said that under federal law, trademarks may not be granted involving the names of living individuals, without their written consent. “Our courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And these name restrictions served established principles,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court's opinion. “This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause — a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction — is compatible with the First Amendment. We need look no further.” Californian and Democratic activist Steve Elster attempted to trademark the phrase after a viral moment between then business mogul Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R, Fla.) in 2016 when the two were both vying for the Republican nomination for president. After Trump continually called Rubio “Little Marco,” the senator fought back on the campaign trail by calling Trump's hands small. “You know what they say about men with small hands,” Rubio said, then pausing to wait for the crowd to laugh at the innuendo. “You can’t trust ’em!” ALERT: Rubio makes fun of Trump's short fingers: ""You know what they say about men with small hands"" pic.twitter.com/LR1uhAsv2K In a presidential debate on March 3, 2016 in Detroit, Michigan, Trump showed off his hands to the crowd.: “Look at those hands. Are they small hands?” Trump asked at the debate. “If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee it.” Read More: Debunking 12 Myths About Trump’s Conviction Elster applied for the trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2018 to use on shirts and hats he was selling. The Patent and Trademark Office then rejected the application, utilizing the Lanham Act in their decision, which states that federal law disallows trademarks that use a person’s name without their consent. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the rejection, it unanimously decided that the Lanham Act was unconstitutional, and argued that it did not trump an individual’s ability to criticize a government official or public figure. The Supreme Court’s decision, though, argues unanimously that the Lanham Act and the “name clause” do not violate the First Amendment, and neither did the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in their rejection. Thomas also said that the case was narrow in scope, and did not require further questioning and decisioning into trademark rights, leaving space open for further cases on the matter. Estler will still be able to sell merchandise with the phrase on it, as well as the hand gesture accompanying it, just without a trademark.“Critically, the denial did not prevent Elster from communicating his message. It also did not restrict his preferred mode of expression,” wrote Justice Sonya Sotomayor in a concurring opinion. Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories here"
93,Nik Popli,Supreme Court Unanimously Strikes Down Challenge to Abortion Drug Mifepristone,https://time.com/6988192/supreme-court-abortion-pill-mifepristone-decision/,The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected a challenge to curtail access to the commonly-used abortion pill mifepristone.,2024-06-13T14:28:04Z,"The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected a challenge to curtail access to the commonly-used abortion pill mifepristone, with the Justices finding that a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations had no legal basis to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the medication. As a result, the lawsuit has been dismissed and the abortion pill can remain widely available. ""Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA’s regulation of others,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the unanimous decision. The case centered on the accessibility of mifepristone, the only drug approved specifically for terminating pregnancies, and whether the government applied a lawful review process of the drug when it first came out. The Supreme Court decided to hear the case after a lower court in 2023 revoked the FDA’s 23-year-old approval of mifepristone, a move that would restrict how the pill is delivered and distributed. The restrictions, if allowed to go into effect, included cutting off access to the pill through the mail, barring telemedicine prescriptions, and reinstating a seven-week limit on its use—even in states where abortion remains legal. Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California at Davis with an expertise in abortion, described the opinion as a “very narrow textbook ruling on standing” that “doesn’t tell you much beyond the narrow question in the case.” “I'm sure the abortion rights movement is happy that access to mifepristone is unchanged today,” she tells TIME. “At the same time, this ruling doesn't say anything about any of the substantive arguments made against mifepristone. All of the arguments are just as alive today as they were yesterday, if other plaintiffs can raise them.” Medication abortion has become an increasingly common and safe method for terminating pregnancies; more than five million women in the U.S. have used mifepristone for abortions since its approval, and six in 10 abortions last year were performed through medication, up from 53% in 2020, research published in March 2024 from the Guttmacher Institute shows. Although dozens of countries have approved mifepristone for use, including the U.S., its safety has come under scrutiny after the fall of Roe v. Wade. The plaintiffs in the case—led by a group of anti-abortion doctors and organizations—argued that the FDA did not adequately study the safety risks of the drug before approving it for sale in 2000, claiming that doctors have had to treat patients who suffered from complications from mifepristone. The Justices, however, said that the doctors did not suffer the type of direct harm that would give them legal grounds to bring the lawsuit. The FDA has also countered safety concerns about mifepristone, pointing to data documenting the drug’s efficacy and safety, ​​terminating pregnancies successfully  99.6% of the time with a complication rate lower than Tylenol. “The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,” Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. But “those kinds of objections alone do not establish a justiciable case or controversy in federal court.” Ziegler says the Court’s opinion could offer a potential roadmap to future plaintiffs who do want to establish standing in later cases. It could also enable former President Donald Trump, if he were to be elected to a second term, to prompt the Department of Justice to enforce the rarely used, anti-obscenity law known as the Comstock Act to curtail access to mifepristone, she says. Trump has publicly said that abortion rights should be left to the states, but he declined to comment when asked by TIME in May if he would enforce the Comstock Act. In their ruling, the Justices did not address the plaintiffs’ claim that the FDA’s approval of mifepristone and subsequent modifications to allow mail delivery violated the Comstock Act, which governs how the U.S. Postal Service handles the delivery of contraception and items considered “obscene.” Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas repeatedly invoked the Act during oral arguments. “This is a prominent provision. It’s not some obscure subsection of a complicated, obscure law,” Alito said. “Everybody in this field knew about it.” The ruling marks the first time that the Justices have considered efforts to restrict abortion since their 2022 decision to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion. Following that ruling, 14 states completely banned abortion—including medication abortion—and six states began requiring patients to see their physicians in person before getting prescriptions for abortion pills. The issue has become a rallying point for Democrats, and polls show that the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022 was met with disapproval by a majority of Americans. President Joe Biden, who has promised to restore abortion protections if Democrats win control of Congress, said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s decision “does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues” and criticized Republicans for allowing extreme abortion bans in certain states.

94,LINDSAY WHITEHURST / AP,"Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump-Era Ban on Bump Stocks, Gun Accessories Used in 2017 Vegas Massacre",https://time.com/6988630/supreme-court-trump-era-ban-bump-stocks-gun-accessories/,"The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, a gun accessory that allows semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns.",2024-06-14T14:34:44Z,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, a gun accessory that allows semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns and was used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The high court found 6-3 the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it reversed course and banned bump stocks after a gunman in Las Vegas attacked a country music festival with assault rifles in 2017. He fired more than 1,000 rounds in the crowd in 11 minutes, leaving 60 people dead and injuring hundreds more. A Texas gun shop owner challenged the ban, arguing the Justice Department wrongly classified the accessories as illegal machine guns. The Biden administration said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives made the right choice for the accessories that can allow weapons to fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. It marked the latest gun case to come before high court, where a conservative supermajority handed down a landmark decision expanding gun rights in 2022 and is also weighing another gun case challenging a federal law intended to keep guns away from people under domestic violence restraining orders. The arguments in the bump stock case, though, were more about whether the ATF had overstepped its authority than the Second Amendment. Justices from the court’s liberal wing suggested it was “common sense” that anything capable of unleashing a “torrent of bullets” was a machine gun under federal law. Conservative justices, though, raised questions about why Congress had not acted to ban bump stocks, as well as the effects of the ATF changing its mind a decade after declaring the accessories legal. The high court took up the case after a split among lower courts over bump stocks, which were invented in the early 2000s. Under Republican President George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, the ATF decided that bump stocks didn’t transform semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. The agency reversed those decisions at Trump’s urging after the shooting in Las Vegas and another mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida high school that left 17 dead. Bump stocks are accessories that replace a rifle’s stock, the part that rests against the shoulder. They harness the gun’s recoil energy so that the trigger bumps against the shooter’s stationary finger, allowing the gun to fire at a rate comparable to a traditional machine gun. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have their own bans on bump stocks. The plaintiff, Texas gun shop owner and military veteran Michael Cargill, was represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group funded by conservative donors like the Koch network. His attorneys acknowledged that bump stocks allow for rapid fire, but argued that they are different because the shooter has to put in more effort keep the gun firing. Government lawyers countered the effort required from the shooter is small, and doesn’t make a legal difference. The Justice Department said the ATF changed its mind on bump stocks after doing a more in-depth examination spurred by the Las Vegas shooting and came to the right conclusion. There were about 520,000 bump stocks in circulation when the ban went into effect in 2019, requiring people to either surrender or destroy them, at a combined estimated loss of $100 million, the plaintiffs said in court documents."

Fetterman At Fault in Car Accident and Seen Going ‘High Rate of Speed,’ Police Say",https://time.com/6988541/sen-fetterman-at-fault-in-car-accident/,Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman was seen driving at a “high rate of speed” on Sunday just before he rear-ended another car in Maryland.,2024-06-13T22:56:40Z,"Harrisburg, Pa. — Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman was seen driving at a “high rate of speed” on Sunday morning just before he rear-ended another car on Interstate 70 in Maryland, according to a state police report. The police report said Fetterman was at fault in the crash. Both cars were towed and Fetterman, his wife, Gisele, and the motorist he hit were all taken to the hospital for minor injuries, police said. Fetterman's office earlier this week acknowledged the accident, saying he was treated for a bruised shoulder and discharged within hours. Earlier this year, the Democratic senator pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania to a citation for exceeding the speed limit by 34 mph (54 kph), according to court records. Sunday's crash, just before 8 a.m., happened after another motorist saw Fetterman pass her traveling ""at a high rate of speed, well over the posted speed limit,"" the police report said. The speed limit on I-70 is 70 mph (113 kph). Moments later, Fetterman rear-ended the other vehicle, driven by a 62-year-old woman, the report said. Fetterman was not tested for alcohol or substance use, and the report does not say he was distracted. Fetterman returned to his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania, where he posted a video with Gisele acknowledging the accident, thanking well-wishers and saying that it wasn't how they had wanted to spend their 16th wedding anniversary. Fetterman, 54, suffered a stroke in May 2022 as he was campaigning for his seat. As a result, he still has some trouble speaking fluidly and quickly processing spoken conversation, and he often uses devices in congressional hearings and routine conversations to transcribe spoken words in real time."
96,KATE BRUMBACK / AP,Fani Willis Appears to Call Out Her Critics in Trump Case During Church Speech,https://time.com/6988546/fani-willis-call-out-critics-trump-case/,Fani Willis called out her critics in a defiant speech Thursday at a Black church outside Atlanta.,2024-06-13T23:33:30Z,"Marietta, Ga. — Fani Willis called out her critics in a defiant speech Thursday at a Black church outside Atlanta, not naming names but appearing to refer to Donald Trump and others who have attacked the Georgia prosecutor's investigation of the former president's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, obtained an indictment last year against Trump and 18 of his allies. She has faced months of criticism over her handling of the case — with some of the attacks playing on racist or sexist tropes — as well as for hiring a special prosecutor, now off the case, with whom she had a romantic relationship. Speaking to a gathering of Black church clergy and congregants, Willis said friends often express concern for her. “I live the experience of a Black woman who is attacked and oversexualized,” she said. “See, I’m so tired of hearing these idiots call my name as ‘fanny’ in a way to attempt to humiliate me because, like silly school boys, the name reminds them of a woman’s rear, of her behind.” Trump has used that pronunciation to mock Willis — whose first name is pronounced FAH'-nee — notably during a rally in Ohio in March when he said “fanny, like your ass,"" when talking about her name. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Willis said her father, “a strong, educated, conscious Black man,” gave her the name Fani Taifa, which she said means “prosperous people” in Swahili. Willis' outspokenness in response to critics is not new. But her out-of-court statements have been seized on by defense attorneys for Trump and drawn admonishment from the judge in the case, which is mostly on hold as a Georgia appeals court reviews whether she should be allowed to stay on it. At the annual planning meeting of the Georgia AME church, Willis told the crowd gathered in the sanctuary of a church in suburban Marietta that friends often express concern about the attacks on her but that she shakes off the ugliness. “What I'm here to tell you is to not concern yourself with insults of me. I promise you, I don't concern myself with them,” she told the supportive audience, drawing shouted affirmations throughout her 25-minute remarks. “I am too busy working 15-hour days trying to use every talent God gave me to fulfill my God-given purpose.” Willis also said that she works hard “to hold all — all, there are no exceptions — who dare to come into our community and break the law accountable.” That mirrors her standard response when she's asked about prosecuting a former president — that no one is above the law. The August indictment accuses Trump and the others of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, which Trump narrowly lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. Republican lawmakers in Atlanta and Washington have targeted her since the indictment, opening investigations into her office. She has had a particularly barbed exchange with U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who has questioned her motivations and demanded that she produce records. She appeared to take another swipe at Jordan Thursday, saying, “We have politicians that spend no time doing their elected purpose. In fact, we got a clown in Washington D.C. who's been elected for the purpose to make his community safer and pass laws. But he's been sitting there for 17 years and passed zero laws.” Jordan entered Congress in 2007, 17 years ago. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Defense attorneys for Trump and others have pointed to a speech Willis gave at a historic Black church in Atlanta in January, saying she inappropriately inserted race and God into the case, potentially prejudicing potential jurors against their clients. Those arguments have come in an ongoing effort to get Willis and her office removed from the election interference prosecution or to have the case dismissed entirely. The Willis removal effort began with the revelation that she had had a romantic relationship with attorney Nathan Wade, whom she had hired as a special prosecutor for the case. Defense attorneys argued that Willis improperly profited from the case when Wade used his earnings to take her on vacation, resulting in a conflict of interest. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March ruled that there was not a conflict that should force Willis off the case, but he said there was an “appearance of impropriety.” He allowed Willis to remain on the case as long as Wade did not, and the special prosecutor resigned hours later. The Georgia Court of Appeals last month agreed to take up the case and lawyers for Trump earlier this week asked the court to hear oral arguments. Willis' team on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing there is insufficient evidence to support reversing the lower court’s order. The case against Trump and the other eight defendants involved in the appeal has been halted by the appeals court while it reviews the lower court ruling. That means the case against Trump, one of four criminal cases against the former president, almost definitely will not proceed to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president."

Led by the right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 is a presidential transition operation—basically a government-in-waiting if former President Donald Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, 2025. The $22 million effort does not say it is specifically intended for Trump, but that it wants a conservative as the next commander-in-chief. The project, published in 2023, includes a nearly 1,000-page handbook that detailed a conservative agenda for the next president. Project 2025 said on its website that the handbook is “the next conservative President’s last opportunity to save our republic.” “It is not enough for conservatives to win elections,” Project 2025 said on its website. “If we are going to rescue the country from the grip of the radical Left, we need both a governing agenda and the right people in place, ready to carry this agenda out on day one of the next conservative administration. That is the goal of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project.” “With the right conservative policy recommendations and properly vetted and trained personnel to implement them, we will take back our government,” the project continued. Read More: How Far Trump Would Go Dozens of conservative organizations are behind the effort. Part of the plan includes firing federal employees that conservatives believe are preventing right-wing policies from being implemented and replacing them with their own picks, the Associated Press reported. The handbook detailed “a top-to-bottom overhaul” of the Department of Justice and putting an end to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) efforts to curb the spread of misinformation. The handbook said that “the FBI have absolutely no business policing speech.” The agenda also included a crackdown on abortion pills, which it called “the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world.” The handbook urged the Food and Drug Administration to reverse the approval of the pills, claiming that the approval process was “politicized” and “illegal” (more than 100 scientific studies over decades have found that both mifepristone and misoprostol, the two abortion-inducing drugs, are safe). The Associated Press previously called the handbook’s language “apocalyptic.” The handbook encouraged the next presidential administration to “reexamine the balance between media demands and space constraints on the White House premises,” saying that there is “no legal entitlement” for the press corps to have permanent space on the premises. Many critics have labeled Project 2025 as “authoritarian.” The project relies on what legal scholars call the unitary executive theory, which dismisses the idea that there are three separate branches of government for checks and balances, The New York Times reported. Rather, proponents of the theory argue that Article 2 of the Constitution allows the president to have total authority over the executive branch. “Some of these visions, they do start to just bleed into some kind of authoritarian fantasies where the president won the election, so he’s in charge, so everyone has to do what he says—and that’s just not the system the government we live under,” Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the separation of powers in the U.S., previously told the Associated Press.

98,Brian Bennett,Hunter Biden Found Guilty on Gun Charges,https://time.com/6987280/hunter-biden-guilty-gun-trial/,A federal jury found Hunter Biden guilty for lying about his drug use when buying a gun in 2018.,2024-06-11T16:02:22Z,"For the first time, a sitting President’s son has been convicted of a felony in a criminal trial.   A federal jury in Delaware on Tuesday found Hunter Biden guilty for lying about his drug use when buying a gun in 2018. Prosecutors had presented the jury with photos, testimony and messages that showed Biden had a .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver for about 11 days during a period he had previously acknowledged he had been struggling with drug addiction.  The jury deliberated for about three hours over two days and found Biden guilty of three felonies including making a false claim on a gun purchase form that he was not a drug user, lying to a federally licensed firearms dealer, and unlawfully possessing the weapon for 11 days.  First Lady Jill Biden arrived at the courthouse in Wilmington to show her support for Hunter Biden shortly after the verdict was read on Tuesday morning.  His aunt Valerie Biden Owens and his uncle James Biden were also at the courthouse Tuesday. During closing arguments on Monday, President Biden had arranged his schedule so he would be at his home about 5 miles from the federal courthouse for most of the day before returning to the White House for a concert marking Juneteenth on the South Lawn.  Biden is the first sitting president to have to contend with running the country while their child was being prosecuted by their own Justice Department. The jury's decision is not only a crushing blow to the President and his family, but throws an unpredictable wrench in a presidential race that could be a nail biter. Hunter Biden’s conviction comes less than two weeks after a Manhattan jury found former President Donald Trump guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star. Democrats have expressed hope that Trump's new status as a felon will undermine his appeal to swing voters. It's unclear if the conviction of the current President's own son will shift the contours of the contest. Biden has repeatedly said he would not interfere with the judicial process in his son’s case, vowing to accept the jury’s verdict and ruling out using his authority to pardon Hunter. “I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” President Biden said in a statement released after the guilty verdict on Tuesday. In his statement, Biden spoke directly to Hunter Biden’s struggle with drug addiction, saying that “so many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.” Biden said that he and the First Lady will “always be there” for Hunter and the rest of their family. “Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Biden said. After the verdict, Hunter Biden said in a statement that he is “disappointed by the outcome” but “more grateful” for the love and support shown by his family and friends. He also referenced his efforts to recover from drug addiction. “Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time,” he said. Biden’s defense team had argued in court that Biden bought the gun during a period of sobriety while he was swinging back and forth between drug use and rehabilitation. The defense also claimed that the federal form was too vague about what defined a drug user or how long before purchasing a gun a person was expected to have not used illegal drugs But the jury believed Justice Department prosecutors had shown enough evidence that Hunter Biden was a drug user at the time of the purchase to convict him. In his closing argument, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors that no one was above the law and that the jury should take into account Hunter Biden’s pattern of drug use; evidence presented during the trial suggested he had used drugs weeks before purchasing the gun and in the days after. The trial shined a harsh spotlight on Hunter Biden’s internal family turmoil, particularly in the years following the death of his older brother Beau Biden from brain cancer in 2015. Hunter’s daughter Naomi as well as his brother’s widow Hallie were called to testify and exposed the turbulent times Hunter Biden went through as he struggled with drug addiction after his brother died.  Hallie Biden had a brief, combustible relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau’s death. She told the jury how she found an unloaded handgun while searching Hunter’s truck in October 2018 and was worried Hunter might use it on himself or that her children might find it. So, she said, she took the gun and threw it away into a garbage can at a Wilmington grocery store. That set in motion a chain of events that resulted in Hunter Biden being charged with federal drug crimes. Hallie had testified that she didn’t see him use drugs during the days immediately around the gun purchase. But prosecutors showed the jury a text message about drug use the day before he bought the gun and another message sent the day after.   Hunter Biden also faces federal tax charges in Los Angeles for allegedly failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes on income from foreign businesses. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. That case is set to go to trial in September. The gun charges were brought after a years-long investigation by Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware who was appointed by former President Donald Trump. Weiss initially began investigating Hunter Biden’s tax affairs in December 2020, weeks after Joe Biden won the 2020 election. The decision by Weiss to bring the gun case to trial drew surprise in some legal circles, as it’s an offense that’s rarely prosecuted. Hunter Biden had previously reached an agreement with the Justice Department to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and avoid prosecution on the gun charge if he was willing to submit to probation, enter a diversion program, remain drug-free for 24 months, and agree to never own a firearm again. But that deal fell apart in court in July 2023."
99,LISA MASCARO / AP,"Trump Returning to Capitol Hill to Meet With Republican Lawmakers, a First Since Jan. 6 Attack",https://time.com/6988144/trump-capitol-hill-return-republican-lawmakers-jan-6-attack/,Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans.,2024-06-13T11:06:01Z,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump is making a triumphant return to Capitol Hill to meet with House and Senate Republicans, his first since sending the mob to “fight like hell” ahead of the Jan.6, 2021 attack, as GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House. Despite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrives Thursday emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign. “We’re excited to welcome President Trump back,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction. The Republican speaker demurred over whether he’s asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. “Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.” Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign — including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. In between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda. But the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump’s return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power. “It’s frustrating,” said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election. Dunn spoke of the “irony” of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. “It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they’re truly putting party and person over country,"" he said. ""And it’s sad.” Many of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress. Johnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities. Outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the “disgraceful” attack that he called an “insurrection” now endorses the party’s presumptive nominee and said: ""Of course I’ll be at the meeting.” Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he’s interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and “ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.” Thune said, “I think there’s an opportunity there to really make this a big win.” As democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol. “This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. Making Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as “warriors” and “patriots,” and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy. Moreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home. Republicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case. When former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn’t be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies. “Paul Ryan, you’re a piece of garbage,"" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. ""We should kick you out of the party.” Of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting ""he’s going to be the next president, so you have to work” together. Asked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: “Let the day’s own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall. “Look, we’ve got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we’re like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,” Tillis said."
