Advertisement Now, Adomas Valantinas at Brown University in Rhode Island and his colleagues have spotted frost that appears to only form in the morning, during Martian winters, near the peaks of volcanoes in the Tharsis region, which includes some of the solar system’s largest volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons. “This is quite exciting because it tells you how dynamic Mars’s water system is, but also how water can be found in different amounts basically everywhere on Mars,” says Valantinas. He and his team took morning pictures of the icy volcanic peaks using a colour camera aboard the European Space Agency’s Trace Gas Orbiter, which studies the Martian atmosphere, and spotted wide regions of blue frost. They ruled out frozen carbon dioxide, which can look similar, as the cause by calculating the surface temperatures and finding it was too warm for CO2 to freeze. Though there is a possibility the ice is formed from gases coming out of the volcano, Valantinas and his team would it expect to see it all year round if this was the case. Instead, the fact that it only appears during the colder parts of the year, makes it more likely the frost is a result of water vapour in the atmosphere freezing out.

In many species, dominant males have larger testes than subordinates, often because they have more testosterone. Studies have also shown that males in species that have lots of males living together have bigger testicles than in species where only one male lives in a group. Because larger testicles can make more sperm, this improves a male’s chances of fathering offspring if females mate with several males.  Read moreEvolution is evolving: 13 ways we must rethink the theory of nature  Read more Evolution is evolving: 13 ways we must rethink the theory of nature Advertisement Gabrielle Bueno and Rebecca Lewis from the University of Texas at Austin tested if this pattern holds true within a single population by looking at the testes size of 23 adult male Verreaux’s sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) in Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. This was done outside the mating season over a 13-year period. This population of lemurs is made up of several groups, with some having only one male and others having multiple males. Although females hold the most social power, as in all lemur societies, males also have their own hierarchy. Dominant ones have a brown, greasy stain on their chest due to constant scent marking, whereas subordinates have clean white torsos. The researchers found that stained males in multi-male groups have testicles that are, on average, 103 per cent larger than those of clean males within their group, and 31 per cent larger than those of stained males in single-male units. The stained lemurs in multi-male groups may be producing more testosterone than the other lemurs, or suppressing the amount of testosterone the clean males can produce, says Bueno. A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet’s animals, plants and other organisms. Stained males in multi-male groups don’t just have more sizeable scrotums in absolute terms – they are also larger relative to their body size. Bueno says that this shows dominant males invest more energy in sperm competition when there are other males around. “Importantly, they are able to switch that,” says Bueno. The dominant male always has the biggest testicles, so if a clean male with larger testes enters the group, the stained male’s gonads grow. This “highlights how insanely flexible they are and how in tune they are with their social environment”, says Bueno. “The flexible adjustment of testes size of males living under different conditions across their lifespan is remarkable,” says Peter Kappeler at the University of Göttingen in Germany. This raises important questions about the potential costs of maintaining large testes, he adds. Growing larger testicles uses up energy that then can’t be spent elsewhere, and is likely to mean they have to find more food.

The fossil was found in 2021 by Kevin Petersen, the curator at Kronosaurus Korner, a museum near the outback town of Richmond in Queensland. Normally with pterosaurs – flying reptiles that inhabited Earth at the same time as dinosaurs – you might find one bone, says Petersen. “But as I started to dig around, more and more bone started to show and I realised I needed to go very carefully,” he says. Advertisement  Read moreLargest ever animal may have been Triassic ichthyosaur super-predator  Read more Largest ever animal may have been Triassic ichthyosaur super-predator Nearly a quarter of the skeleton has now been recovered, making it the most complete pterosaur ever found by scientists in Australia. The entire lower jaw was preserved, along with part of the upper jaw, vertebrae, ribs, and leg and feet bones. But most surprising was the preservation of the extremely delicate throat bones, just a few millimetres in diameter, which reminded Petersen of spaghetti. The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. A team led by Adele Pentland at Curtin University in Perth realised the fossil belonged to an entirely new genus and species in the Anhangueria family of pterosaurs, which are found globally. The creature is estimated to have had a wingspan of 4.6 metres. In honour of Petersen, it has been named Haliskia peterseni. Although unrelated to birds, it would have looked a bit like a giant pelican, says Petersen. But Pentland says it would have been a “demon pelican” because it had a mouth full of spiky teeth. What sets H. peterseni apart from any other known pterosaur is that its throat bones are much larger, indicating that it had a massive, muscular tongue, says Pentland. The team thinks the tongue was used to catch and hold prey, probably slippery animals such as squid and fish. Once prey was grabbed by its jaws, H. peterseni’s teeth would have closed like a zipper or cage, preventing escape, says Pentland.

The tongue was also probably used to push the meal down into its throat. During the Cretaceous Period, when H. peterseni lived, what is now inland Queensland was covered by ocean, which was the pterosaur’s hunting ground. “It was really breathtaking to see the remains of this fossil animal and to imagine the abundance of life that must have been there at that time and how very different it would have been to what we see in outback Queensland today,” says Pentland.

It turned out that left-leaning users were more likely to accuse others of being bots, and those who were accused were more likely to be right-leaning. “A potential explanation might be that media frequently reported about right-wing bot networks influencing major events like the [2016] US election,” says Assenmacher. “However, this is just speculation and would need confirmation.” Journal reference:Proceedings of the Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media DOI: 10.1609/icwsm.v18i1.31301 Journal reference: Proceedings of the Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media DOI: 10.1609/icwsm.v18i1.31301 Topics: Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

Now this system has extended northwards into the southern US, causing extreme temperatures across a large region. A heat dome is not a clearly defined scientific term, but it is used by many weather forecasters. The American Meteorological Society defines it as an “exceptionally hot air mass that develops when high pressure aloft prevents warm air below from rising”. High pressure results in clear skies because sinking air warms as it descends – clouds form under the opposite circumnstances, with water droplets condensing out as rising air cools. These high-pressure conditions mean lots of sunshine, which results in further warming and can dry out the soil, leading to less evaporation and a reduced chance of clouds and rain. These positive feedbacks can produce hotter and hotter conditions the longer the heat dome stays in one place. While heat domes cause heatwaves, there can be heatwaves without heat domes.

But sometimes big loops form in a jet stream, resulting in weather systems getting stuck in the loops. These blocking patterns, as they are known, can lead to extreme cold, extreme rain or, in the case of heat domes, extreme heat.

They can last anywhere from days to weeks. For instance, an extreme heat dome over Canada and the northwest US in 2021 lasted nearly a month. During this event, the temperature reached nearly 50°C (122°F) in British Columbia, the highest ever recorded in Canada. Heatwaves in general are becoming more frequent because of climate change, but most studies don’t look specifically at heatwaves caused by heat domes. There is a lot of debate about how warming will affect the blocking patterns that trap heat domes in place. A 2023 study concluded there will be an increase in “summer heat-dome-like stationary waves” over northwestern North America. Yes, this is certain. Because the world is now nearly 1.5°C warmer than in preindustrial times, when heat domes form today surface temperatures can get hotter than they previously would have. For instance, one study concluded the extreme temperatures recorded during the 2021 heat dome in Canada were “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change”. There is also some evidence that the intensity of heat domes is outpacing the warming trend, suggesting climate change is amplifying their intensity. “The intensities of hot extremes associated with… heat dome-like atmospheric circulations increase faster than background global warming in both historical change and future projection”, states a 2023 study.

In lab experiments, Annika Vaksmaa at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and her colleagues have shown that the white, thread-like fungus can successfully degrade one of the most pernicious plastics, polyethylene, providing the plastic has first been exposed to UV radiation, such as from sunlight.  Read moreCould mysterious marine fungi save us from antibiotic resistance?  Read more Could mysterious marine fungi save us from antibiotic resistance? Advertisement UV radiation can induce chemical modifications in polyethylene that make the plastic more susceptible to attack by the fungal enzymes, says Vaksmaa. The digestion process releases carbon dioxide, the emissions weight for weight are no greater than the small amount that humans release while breathing, the team found. Vaksmaa believes that the fungus, known as Parengyodontium album, has great potential, but she is cautious about putting it to use in the wild. “If we take a microbe and add it to a natural system, then we may ruin it while trying to do good,” she says. Instead, she suggests it may be best to gather the plastic first and bring it back to land to be digested by P. album that has been grown in bulk. This could be achieved using well-established techniques, similar to those used in the brewing industry, she says. Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month. The need for UV exposure means that P. album won’t work on plastic that sinks. But given the diversity of marine fungi, Vaksmaa thinks it very probable that her team will find some deep-sea species that can do this. Humans produce more than 400 billion kilograms of plastic each year, and up to 4 per cent of it is thought to end up in the ocean. “It’s great to see that microbes can help with mitigating relatively large problems. But dealing with it at its source is key, which means actually stopping plastic from ending up in nature in the first place,” she says.

Their demands included a “credible” carbon-cutting strategy for the country, amid an election campaign that has seen little in-depth discussion of the UK’s net-zero transition.  Read moreIs climate change accelerating after a record year of heat?  Read more Is climate change accelerating after a record year of heat? Advertisement Why are the scientists worried? After all, the UK has one of the most ambitious climate targets in the world – a legally binding goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 – and has halved its greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. But the truth is that the UK’s race to net zero has slowed to a crawl in recent years, with annual emissions falling at half the rate required to meet interim targets. Although huge progress has been made in decarbonising the electricity supply, with zero-carbon sources now generating about half of all power, other sectors are lagging. Outside the electricity sector, the rate of emissions cuts must quadruple over the next seven years if the UK is to meet its promise to reduce emissions by 68 per cent by 2030, the UK government’s climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said in October. It warned that the UK is “unlikely” to get there under current plans. Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month. “There’s just a really strong sense of frustration in the climate science community,” says Emily Shuckburgh at the University of Cambridge, who jointly organised the scientists’ letter. “We just simply haven’t seen the level of response required.” Slow progress means problems have mounted, waiting in the wings for the next government to tackle. By the end of the decade, emissions from surface transport – that is road, rail and ships – need to fall by almost 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, quadruple the rate of the previous decade. Electric car sales may be growing strongly, but sales of electric vans and trucks are lagging and the number of public charge points isn’t growing quickly enough to keep pace with the volume of electric vehicles hitting the roads. Meanwhile, the use of public transport fell sharply during the covid-19 pandemic and hasn’t returned to its previous levels. Getting the transport sector to net zero will require more than just convincing everyone to buy an electric car, says Michael Pollitt at the University of Cambridge. Fewer cars, and smaller ones, are a crucial part of the puzzle. “One would like to see more radical thinking on inter-urban transport, such as prioritisation of lanes for smaller vehicles, and thinking of radically reducing vehicle sizes and vehicle weights,” he says. “If we can get people moving in radically smaller vehicles or in mass transit, that is the way that we are going to get to net zero in transport.” When it comes to buildings, home heating is the major headache. About 23 million homes in the UK are heated by gas boilers. All these homes need to be warmed by zero-carbon energy sources by mid-century, with most expected to switch to heat pumps.  Read moreNet-zero living: How your day will look in a carbon-neutral world  Read more Net-zero living: How your day will look in a carbon-neutral world But the transition is going far too slowly. In 2022, just 69,000 heat pumps were installed in UK homes, far short of the 600,000 installations per year targeted by 2028. Part of the problem is financial: heat pumps cost far more to install than a gas boiler and often cost more to run due to extra levies on the cost of grid power. “We absolutely must get the price of heat pumps down,” says Pollitt. “Unless the price of heat pumps comes down substantially, that is a major roadblock to decarbonising heating.” There’s an urgency to solving these problems, says Nick Eyre at the University of Oxford, who signed the open letter. Gas boilers installed in 2035 will still be heating homes in 2050. “Heat pumps and vehicles, we will need to have pretty much cracked by the early 2040s. That means being very serious about it in the 2030s,” he says. That is why inaction during this decade, when the UK government should be focusing on getting industries ready for mass deployment, is so worrying. “We know what to do,” says Eyre. “But the last couple of years, in particular, have been a period where there’s not really been any action at all.” Beyond heat, power and transport, even tougher choices lie ahead. Emissions from agriculture and land use, for example, have barely changed in a decade, but need to fall 29 per cent by 2035. Delivering these cuts is likely to involve action to change people’s diets. Likewise, cutting aviation emissions will require action to control demand, such as a tax on frequent fliers. “The biggest challenge will be starting to impose policies and regulations which affect people’s day-to-day lives,” says Leo Mercer at the London School of Economics. “If policies aren’t communicated well, people push back pretty strongly.” Alongside domestic challenges, the UK needs to regain its reputation on the international stage. Under former prime minister Boris Johnson, the UK hosted the COP26 climate summit and led international coalitions on deforestation, methane and electric vehicles.  Read moreLab-grown meat could be 25 times worse for the climate than beef  Read more Lab-grown meat could be 25 times worse for the climate than beef But the UK’s slowing progress on its domestic climate agenda, alongside cuts to international aid and climate diplomacy, has weakened its international reputation. UK government decisions to approve new domestic fossil fuel projects, while urging low-income countries to “transition away” from fossil fuels, has also rankled. Without countries like the UK demonstrating that net zero is achievable – and desirable – as a national strategy, convincing low-income countries to cut emissions is an uphill battle. It is therefore crucial for the UK to re-establish its reputation as a climate leader in the next parliament, says Caterina Brandmayr at Imperial College London. Next year, countries are due to submit new commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 under the Paris Agreement. “This, therefore, is a pivotal moment for the global community,” she says. “This parliament will be crucial not only to ensure delivery in the UK, but also to raise ambition globally.” So, will any party deliver the scale of action needed to put the UK back on track? All the major parties agree on the need to reach net zero by mid-century. And there is striking agreement between Labour and the Conservatives on the need for more renewable power, particularly offshore wind. Labour, however, has the eye-catching promise to deliver a fully decarbonised grid by 2030. Adam Bell at UK consultancy Stonehaven, and a former senior energy official in the UK government, says this goal is “very, very ambitious”, and will push the civil service to the limits of what it can deliver. “On power, it’s difficult to find a way in which [Labour] could possibly be more ambitious.” But for Eyre, a manifesto that is credible on climate should also have ambitious aims in areas where the UK is seriously off track – on home energy efficiency, heat pump deployment, industrial emissions, land use, solar power and electric vans. “It is not a question of doing one or two of those,” he says. “We need to do all of them.” Privately, many experts doubt that any of the major parties have a policy programme with the pace and scale needed to deliver net zero by 2050. In its absence, looking for enthusiasm for the challenge ahead might be the next best sign of a party’s credibility. In Eyre’s eyes, the next UK government is embarking on a “decadal process of the same sort of scale as the introduction of steam engines”. “If you don’t have a positive vision yourself,” he says, “you can’t sell that to the rest of the population.” Topics: Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

Their discoveries have increased the amount of known supernovae in the early universe by a factor of 10. The researchers found 79 new supernovae by taking two images of the same tiny patch of the sky, one in 2022 and one in 2023. “It’s actually so small that if you took a grain of rice and held it at arm’s length that would be the size of the patch,” said Christa DeCoursey at the University of Arizona while presenting this work at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Wisconsin on 10 June. “We spent over 100 hours of JWST [observing] time on each image, so these are very, very deep images.”  Read moreOne of the biggest mysteries of cosmology may finally be solved  Read more One of the biggest mysteries of cosmology may finally be solved Advertisement The astronomers then compared the two images with one another and with pictures of the same area taken previously by the Hubble Space Telescope, looking for bright spots that were present in one image but not the others. These spots are stars that had been shining relatively dimly before exploding in bright supernovae and fading out. Several of them are candidates for the most distant supernova ever found, although their distances have not yet been confirmed. And one is definitely the most distant ever confirmed – it blew up when the universe was only about 1.8 billion years old. Supernovae like these probably created the heavy elements that are now spread throughout the universe, so they contain fewer of these elements than modern supernovae do. “The universe was fundamentally different at this early phase than the times that Hubble, and particularly ground-based surveys, were probing in the past,” said Justin Pierel at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland during the presentation. “This is really a new regime that JWST has opened.” Observations in that regime could help reveal what the first stars were like.

Listen on Apple, Spotify or on our podcast page. One moon simply isn’t enough. Earth only has one, while some other planets have many – Jupiter has 95 moons, putting our single shining cosmic partner to shame. In this episode of Dead Planets Society, it’s time to light up the night sky with as many moons as possible. But it isn’t as easy as just chucking a bunch of rocks into orbit, so our hosts Leah Crane and Chelsea Whyte are joined this episode by Sean Raymond at the University of Bordeaux in France for help with the particulars. He suggests we could construct a ring of 10 moons orbiting Earth, each in a different phase, causing strange little eclipses as they march around the planet. Advertisement And it isn’t just moons: in 2018, Raymond and Juna Kollmeier at Carnegie Observatories in California found it is theoretically possible for Earth’s moon to have its own orbiting satellite, dubbed a moonmoon. Such a thing might not be stable because of gravitational anomalies present in our moon, so our hosts are adding a gargantuan immersion blender to their cosmic toolbelt to smooth things out. Once things are sorted, there could be moonmoons and even moonmoonmoons lighting up the night sky. The moon is bright because it reflects sunlight, and these new moons could be the perfect places to put a series of huge solar panels – unobstructed by the atmosphere and clouds that plague Earth’s surface. They would also be so bright it would probably be impossible to ever see the stars from Earth’s surface, but that’s a relatively small detail. The bigger problem: the more complex and crowded the orbits get, the greater the risk of these moons and moonmoons smashing together. This could give our planet beautiful rings like Saturn’s, but it could also destroy life on Earth.

Smaller and lighter than any other known great ape, the newly discovered 10-kilogram primate was a skilled climber that probably ate leaves, says Madelaine Böhme at the University of Tübingen in Germany. “It’s quite a small primate,” she says. “But it differs from all known fossils and, of course, all living great apes we know so far.”  Read moreHow did Paranthropus, the last of the ape-people, survive for so long?  Read more How did Paranthropus, the last of the ape-people, survive for so long? Advertisement About 15 million years ago, in the middle of the Miocene Epoch, hominoids – the great apes – became rarer in Africa and more abundant in Europe. While they sometimes shared habitats with other primates such as pliopithecoids – extinct cousins of apes and Old World monkeys – hominoid species didn’t appear to coexist with each other in Europe. In 2019, Böhme and her colleagues reported the discovery of 37 bones at Bavaria’s Hammerschmiede archaeological site that appeared to come from an early bipedal ape from 11.6 million years ago, which they named Danuvius guggenmosi.  During the excavations, Böhme was surprised when she found two tiny, ape-like teeth and a kneecap in the same layer of sediment as the Danuvius fossils. Keep up with advances in archaeology and evolution with our monthly newsletter. “We kept saying: ‘What is this?’” she says of these smaller fossils. “And then we decided, OK, it’s clear: this is something new.” The fossils are too old for DNA analysis, says Böhme. So the researchers took detailed measurements of the 7-millimetre-long molar and the 16-millimetre-wide kneecap, both from a juvenile, as well as a smaller premolar fragment, which they say came from a young adult. They also calculated the thickness of the enamel and ran microscopic CT scanning of the teeth. The thin enamel, like that of gorillas, suggests a soft diet probably composed of leaves, says Böhme. The shape, thickness and ligament attachment sites of the kneecap resemble those of tree-living primates, hinting that the ape was a proficient climber. The researchers named the new ape Buronius manfredschmidi, after the medieval name of a city near the Hammerschmiede site, and a dentist named Manfred Schmid who has been collecting fossils from the site since the 1970s. Lack of competition for resources might explain why the Buronius and Danuvius apes could live together, says Böhme – Danuvius is thought to have eaten hard foods like nuts and possibly meat. The team cannot rule out the possibility that the larger ape, which might have been up to three times heavier, may have sometimes fed on the smaller species, she adds.  Read moreWho is Ancestor X? The biggest mystery in human evolution  Read more Who is Ancestor X? The biggest mystery in human evolution However, the three fossils might not be sufficient to make such “grandiloquent” conclusions, says Sergio Almécija at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “Could the smaller fossil elements belong to an infantile Danuvius individual?” he asks. “The teeth certainly look like they could be deciduous [baby teeth].” He also wonders whether the kneecap represents the same species as the teeth. “Even though it is suggested that it belongs to a juvenile individual, its size overlaps with the lower range of adult orangutans [which are much larger apes],” says Almécija. Clément Zanolli at the University of Bordeaux, in France, also has doubts. “It is not very clear to me if the teeth – and in particular the molar – belong to the hominoids or to another primate superfamily, the pliopithecoids.” Böhme and her colleagues say their comparisons ruled out the possibility that the teeth are baby teeth or pliopithecoid teeth. In any case, the possibility that two primate species shared the same habitat and perhaps even interacted with each other is a “fantastic discovery”, says Zanolli. “This shows once again that, at that time, Europe was a luxurious and hospitable place for primates to evolve.” Journal reference:PLoS One DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0301002 Journal reference: PLoS One DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0301002 Topics: Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

Curbeam Jr. (left) and Christer Fuglesang on the International Space Station NASA More light could be shed on how space flight affects astronauts’ health after the creation of the first “space-omics” biobank – a collection of thousands of blood and tissue samples, plus medical information, taken over multiple space missions. These include missions to the International Space Station, as well as the first all-civilian space flight, SpaceX’s Inspiration4, which took four non-government-trained astronauts into space for three days in 2021. Called the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), the resource contains detailed medical data, such as on DNA damage and changes in people’s gene activity and immune system functioning, collectively known as biomarkers.

It seems impossible until you do the maths Space flight is known to pose certain health risks. For instance, astronauts lose bone density and muscle mass due to the lack of gravity, and higher levels of radiation in space seem to cause cell and DNA damage, which have a range of impacts on the body. These effects may be why astronauts are more prone to developing heart disease in later life and some have experienced worsening vision after being in space. Collecting astronauts’ medical data in a consistent way via the SOMA biobank will help researchers understand more about these changes and potentially develop ways to mitigate them, says Christopher Mason at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, who helped put the biobank together.

One insight from the Inspiration4 mission is that, despite the astronauts experiencing a host of biomarker changes, most measurements returned to normal within a few months of them coming back to Earth. This suggests that sending civilians into space doesn’t pose more health risks than sending professional astronauts, says Mason. “Instead of people training for decades to go, we could start to really open up space towards more and more people.” The results from Inspiration4, which was crewed by two men and two women, also suggest that the changes in gene activity returned to normal faster in the women. That may be because women’s bodies have to be able to cope with a potential pregnancy, says Mason. “Being able to tolerate large changes in physiology and fluid dynamics may be great for being able to manage pregnancy, but also manage the stress of spaceflight.”  Read moreWhy the big bang may not have been the beginning of the universe  Read more Why the big bang may not have been the beginning of the universe Timothy Etheridge at the University of Exeter in the UK says it will be helpful for researchers around the world to have a common resource they can use. “You need to have a consistent approach to collecting samples,” he says.

The textile, made of a plastic material and silver nanowires, is designed to stay cool in urban settings by taking advantage of a principle known as radiative cooling – the natural process by which objects radiate heat into space.  Read moreThe uncomfortable reality of life on Earth after we breach 1.5°C  Read more The uncomfortable reality of life on Earth after we breach 1.5°C Advertisement The material selectively emits infrared radiation within the narrow band of wavelengths that can escape Earth’s atmosphere. At the same time, it blocks the sun’s radiation and infrared radiation emitted by surrounding structures. Po-Chun Hsu at the University of Chicago in Illinois and his team designed this material to “try to block more than half of [the radiation] from the buildings and the ground”, he says. Some cooling fabrics and building materials already rely on this radiative cooling principle, but most of those designs do not account for radiation from the sun or infrared radiation from structures like buildings and pavement. They also assume the material would be oriented horizontally to the sky like panels on a rooftop, rather than the vertical orientation of material in clothes worn by a person. Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month. Those designs work well “when you are facing a cooler object such as the sky or an open field”, says Hsu. “However, that’s rarely the case when you are facing an urban heat island.” Hsu and his colleagues designed a three-layer textile. The inner layer is made of a common clothing fabric like wool or cotton, and the middle layer consists of silver nanowires that reflect most radiation. The top layer is made of a plastic material called polymethylpentene, which doesn’t absorb or reflect most wavelengths, but emits a narrow band of infrared radiation. In outdoor tests, the textile stayed 8.9°C (16°F) cooler than a regular silk fabric and 2.3°C (4.1°F) cooler than a material that emitted radiation across a broad range. When tested on skin, the textile was 1.8°C (3.2°F) cooler than a cotton fabric. Hsu says this small difference in temperature could theoretically increase the time someone could comfortably be exposed to heat by up to a third, although this hasn’t yet been tested. “Making this stuff practical as a textile is always difficult,” says Aaswath Raman at the University of California, Los Angeles, adding the work is a good demonstration of translating the physical principle of radiative cooling to a usable material. Other materials with similar properties could also be used on the vertical surfaces of buildings, he says. Journal referenceScience

Their demands included a “credible” carbon-cutting strategy for the country, amid an election campaign that has seen little in-depth discussion of the UK’s net-zero transition.  Read moreIs climate change accelerating after a record year of heat?  Read more Is climate change accelerating after a record year of heat? Advertisement Why are the scientists worried? After all, the UK has one of the most ambitious climate targets in the world – a legally binding goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 – and has halved its greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. But the truth is that the UK’s race to net zero has slowed to a crawl in recent years, with annual emissions falling at half the rate required to meet interim targets. Although huge progress has been made in decarbonising the electricity supply, with zero-carbon sources now generating about half of all power, other sectors are lagging. Outside the electricity sector, the rate of emissions cuts must quadruple over the next seven years if the UK is to meet its promise to reduce emissions by 68 per cent by 2030, the UK government’s climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said in October. It warned that the UK is “unlikely” to get there under current plans. Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month. “There’s just a really strong sense of frustration in the climate science community,” says Emily Shuckburgh at the University of Cambridge, who jointly organised the scientists’ letter. “We just simply haven’t seen the level of response required.” Slow progress means problems have mounted, waiting in the wings for the next government to tackle. By the end of the decade, emissions from surface transport – that is road, rail and ships – need to fall by almost 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, quadruple the rate of the previous decade. Electric car sales may be growing strongly, but sales of electric vans and trucks are lagging and the number of public charge points isn’t growing quickly enough to keep pace with the volume of electric vehicles hitting the roads. Meanwhile, the use of public transport fell sharply during the covid-19 pandemic and hasn’t returned to its previous levels. Getting the transport sector to net zero will require more than just convincing everyone to buy an electric car, says Michael Pollitt at the University of Cambridge. Fewer cars, and smaller ones, are a crucial part of the puzzle. “One would like to see more radical thinking on inter-urban transport, such as prioritisation of lanes for smaller vehicles, and thinking of radically reducing vehicle sizes and vehicle weights,” he says. “If we can get people moving in radically smaller vehicles or in mass transit, that is the way that we are going to get to net zero in transport.” When it comes to buildings, home heating is the major headache. About 23 million homes in the UK are heated by gas boilers. All these homes need to be warmed by zero-carbon energy sources by mid-century, with most expected to switch to heat pumps.  Read moreNet-zero living: How your day will look in a carbon-neutral world  Read more Net-zero living: How your day will look in a carbon-neutral world But the transition is going far too slowly. In 2022, just 69,000 heat pumps were installed in UK homes, far short of the 600,000 installations per year targeted by 2028. Part of the problem is financial: heat pumps cost far more to install than a gas boiler and often cost more to run due to extra levies on the cost of grid power. “We absolutely must get the price of heat pumps down,” says Pollitt. “Unless the price of heat pumps comes down substantially, that is a major roadblock to decarbonising heating.” There’s an urgency to solving these problems, says Nick Eyre at the University of Oxford, who signed the open letter. Gas boilers installed in 2035 will still be heating homes in 2050. “Heat pumps and vehicles, we will need to have pretty much cracked by the early 2040s. That means being very serious about it in the 2030s,” he says. That is why inaction during this decade, when the UK government should be focusing on getting industries ready for mass deployment, is so worrying. “We know what to do,” says Eyre. “But the last couple of years, in particular, have been a period where there’s not really been any action at all.” Beyond heat, power and transport, even tougher choices lie ahead. Emissions from agriculture and land use, for example, have barely changed in a decade, but need to fall 29 per cent by 2035. Delivering these cuts is likely to involve action to change people’s diets. Likewise, cutting aviation emissions will require action to control demand, such as a tax on frequent fliers. “The biggest challenge will be starting to impose policies and regulations which affect people’s day-to-day lives,” says Leo Mercer at the London School of Economics. “If policies aren’t communicated well, people push back pretty strongly.” Alongside domestic challenges, the UK needs to regain its reputation on the international stage. Under former prime minister Boris Johnson, the UK hosted the COP26 climate summit and led international coalitions on deforestation, methane and electric vehicles.  Read moreLab-grown meat could be 25 times worse for the climate than beef  Read more Lab-grown meat could be 25 times worse for the climate than beef But the UK’s slowing progress on its domestic climate agenda, alongside cuts to international aid and climate diplomacy, has weakened its international reputation. UK government decisions to approve new domestic fossil fuel projects, while urging low-income countries to “transition away” from fossil fuels, has also rankled. Without countries like the UK demonstrating that net zero is achievable – and desirable – as a national strategy, convincing low-income countries to cut emissions is an uphill battle. It is therefore crucial for the UK to re-establish its reputation as a climate leader in the next parliament, says Caterina Brandmayr at Imperial College London. Next year, countries are due to submit new commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 under the Paris Agreement. “This, therefore, is a pivotal moment for the global community,” she says. “This parliament will be crucial not only to ensure delivery in the UK, but also to raise ambition globally.” So, will any party deliver the scale of action needed to put the UK back on track? All the major parties agree on the need to reach net zero by mid-century. And there is striking agreement between Labour and the Conservatives on the need for more renewable power, particularly offshore wind. Labour, however, has the eye-catching promise to deliver a fully decarbonised grid by 2030. Adam Bell at UK consultancy Stonehaven, and a former senior energy official in the UK government, says this goal is “very, very ambitious”, and will push the civil service to the limits of what it can deliver. “On power, it’s difficult to find a way in which [Labour] could possibly be more ambitious.” But for Eyre, a manifesto that is credible on climate should also have ambitious aims in areas where the UK is seriously off track – on home energy efficiency, heat pump deployment, industrial emissions, land use, solar power and electric vans. “It is not a question of doing one or two of those,” he says. “We need to do all of them.” Privately, many experts doubt that any of the major parties have a policy programme with the pace and scale needed to deliver net zero by 2050. In its absence, looking for enthusiasm for the challenge ahead might be the next best sign of a party’s credibility. In Eyre’s eyes, the next UK government is embarking on a “decadal process of the same sort of scale as the introduction of steam engines”. “If you don’t have a positive vision yourself,” he says, “you can’t sell that to the rest of the population.” Topics: Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

Here, at some infinitesimal point of infinite density, the fabric of the universe gets so ludicrously warped that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes how mass bends space-time, ceases to make sense. At the singularity, our understanding falls apart. As daunting as singularities are, each one is at least safely tucked away inside the event horizon of a black hole, the boundary beyond which we can’t see. This not only cloaks them from view, but also stops unknown effects they herald, namely the horrors of unpredictability, from leaching out into the wider universe. But what if singularities could exist outside black holes after all? That question, given fresh impetus in recent years by demonstrations that general relativity allows for this, has spurred theorists to probe singularities from a deeper perspective, folding in insights from the latest forays into the possible quantum foundations of gravity. Already, they are realising that this new approach “flips the script” on how we think about singularities, says Netta Engelhardt at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

By David Stock
 New Scientist‘s Graham Lawton recently visited two construction sites in Paris that showcase the wonder material of the future: wood. Each site uses wood as an alternative to typical modern construction materials such as steel and concrete, and the potential benefits are numerous: from lower carbon emissions to improved mental health. Wooden construction, it would seem, could help restore our health and the planet’s. At Marcadet Belvédère, a former parcel terminus for the French railway network overlooked by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, property developer WO2 is adding five extra storeys to the existing concrete shell to create new office space. The new storeys are mostly made of cross-laminated timber (CLT), an engineered wood product that rivals concrete and steel as a structural material, but with a much lower carbon footprint. At Arboretum, on the western fringes of Paris, is the largest wooden office project in Europe. It is a campus comprising five new low-rise offices set in parkland. The buildings are made largely of CLT, which, as at Marcadet, means the project has half the lifetime carbon emissions of a standard new build. Topics:"

                                    12 June 2024
                                                                     Josie Ford Josie Ford To learn whether air taxi passengers need worry about collisions with birds, a crash programme in Germany did some tests. What with the complexity and danger of having actual air taxis have congress with actual birds, perfection was out of reach. So the experimenters made do, dropping artificial “bird projectiles” onto a metal plate rigged to measure the impact force. Aditya Devta and Isabel Metz at the German Aerospace Center and Sophie Armanini at the Technical University of Munich describe these violent encounters in a preprint article. (Thanks to reader Mason Porter for alerting us to it.) Advertisement This work was, of necessity, a rough step towards reliably answering the big question. It encountered difficulties, starting with “inconsistencies and lack of repeatability due to human involvement as the bird projectiles were dropped manually by hand”. Future efforts, the report says, “will eliminate the human involvement [so as to] increase accuracy in force measurements and repeatability”. Speaking of birds-and-air-taxis-ish experiments, have you heard the one about the moose and the bullet train? Yong Peng and his colleagues at Central South University in China have begun to examine what might happen when these heavyweights meet at high speed, in the paper “Analysis of moose motion trajectory after bullet train-moose collisions“. The question involves more than the initial, simple impact. The scientists mention two not-unlikely complications: “A moose lying on a track after a crash may increase the risk of train derailment” and “a moose thrown into the air during a collision may also hit and damage the pantograph, which prevents a train from running”. The investigation so far has been done with finite-element mathematical simulations and some not-very-heavyweight experiments. The experiments used fresh beef – beef from cows, not moose – muscle tissue and a kind of stress-strain testing machine known as a “split-Hopkinson pressure bar”. The scientists report that, essentially, the impact force “depends on the contact area between the train and the moose”. As to those complications: “The moose would be pushed away by the V-shaped locomotive and would not cause a derailment, and the height of the moose thrown into the air cannot reach the height of the pantograph, which would prevent damage to the pantograph of a bullet train.” The study suggests that bigger things are approaching: “only the scenario of a train impacting a moose across a track at a speed of 110 km/h was simulated, which cannot fully reflect the risks of train-moose collisions. Thus, more speeds and postures are needed to enhance our study, which is ongoing.” Slowly, sweetly, new sauce insights pour in from readers. These pertain to the off-label usage of ketchup and other sticky foodstuffs to make electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes work well (Feedback, 25 May). Brian Reffin Smith adds a musical note: “You don’t need human skin to test whether electrodes work better with ketchup than with official gel. I have a device which applies a low voltage to plant leaves (or anything else) and then translates the varying current into MIDI signals, sent to a computer or synthesiser to trigger sounds… Anyway, statistically insignificant but anecdotally and culinarily interesting tests reveal that a reduced salt ketchup applied between ECG electrodes and a chilli plant’s leaf produced a quite high E, whilst the proper gel on a neighbouring leaf played G. I thought this might help, but now I don’t think so.” Dave Hardy contributes a practicality claim: “My GP in the early 1970s said that the gel was ridiculously expensive, but strawberry jam worked just as well. I don’t know if he’d experimented with different options or just used what he had to hand. (This was in the Falkland Islands.)” It’s surprising how few people are hailed as being a “celebrity pathologist”, isn’t it? The Associated Press brings news of the death of one of them: “Dr. Cyril Wecht, celebrity pathologist who argued more than 1 shooter killed JFK, dies at 93”. One of the first celebrity pathologists, Bernard Spilsbury (1877-1947), helped establish London’s reputation as the go-to place for entertainingly clever murder mystery investigations. The Royal College of Physicians made clear, postmortemly, that Spilsbury’s career was quite theatrical: “The famous Crippen trial, on which he worked with [William] Wilcox to show that the murder was due to hyoscine hydrobromide, brought him the first blaze of publicity which he deplored in every succeeding trial at which he appeared, and this was undoubtedly why he assumed an austere and frigid manner to all but his intimate friends.” Spilsbury’s manner was nothing to sniff at. One aspect of postmortem work – the dreadful stink of decaying dead bodies – deters sensitive people from entering the profession. Spilsbury wasn’t a sensitive person in that respect. His peers marvelled at what an obituary politely said was a “defective sense of smell”. Marc Abrahams created the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony and co-founded the magazine Annals of Improbable Research.

In the past, infant boys undergoing circumcision were often not given anaesthetic, partly because it was thought that their brains were immature and they couldn’t consciously feel pain. Even today, there remains much uncertainty. Babies cannot tell us what they are experiencing, so it is hard to know what they are conscious of. Recently, neuroscientists have uncovered evidence suggesting newborn infants perceive the world consciously. When newborns encounter certain surprising stimuli, their brain reacts strikingly similarly to the way conscious adult brains react. One method to investigate uses the oddball paradigm.… Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

Light with quantum properties is crucial for many future technologies. Entangled particles within such light could help produce quantum communications networks to support an unhackable internet or quantum imaging techniques for biomedicine. Matjaž Humar at Jožef Stefan Institute in Slovenia says that despite these advanced applications, the methods for making quantum light have barely changed for six decades – until now. He and his colleagues devised a way to create it with liquid crystals.  Read moreHow materials that rewind light can test physics' most extreme ideas  Read more How materials that rewind light can test physics' most extreme ideas Advertisement Team member Vitaliy Sultanov at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Germany says traditionally, researchers hit special crystals with lasers to make them emit quantum light. With this technique, the structure of a crystal determines the properties of the light it emits, which then determines how it can be used. The only way to change these properties is to re-do the experiment with a new crystal, which is costly, time-consuming and impractical. To circumvent this, the researchers used a liquid crystal, a substance made of rod-shaped molecules that can both slosh around like a liquid and assume special arrangements like a more conventional crystal. By exposing a liquid crystal to electric fields, they could adjust its structure – and therefore the properties of quantum light it emitted when shot with lasers. “In this regard, liquid crystal is the perfect material,” says Sultanov. 


 Across several experiments, his team found the liquid crystal was much more tuneable than a solid one, and nearly as efficient at producing light full of entangled particles. “Although the photons produced could perhaps have been generated using traditional crystals, the tuneability of the entanglement could not,” says Miles Padgett at the University of Glasgow in the UK. “These advances could be transformational in terms of applications in [quantum] imaging, communication and sensing.” Maria Chekhova, also at the Max Planck Institute, says if used in quantum communication devices, liquid crystals could make it easier to transmit information through multiple channels at once. This is because the crystal could be tuned to produce light with quantum states capable of encoding lots of information in many of its properties.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images The malaria drug artemisinin is derived from the plant sweet wormwood FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images A medicine already used to treat malaria could also work as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In a small trial of 19 women with PCOS, the widely used drug artemisinin improved the regularity of their menstrual cycles and lowered their testosterone, which is often too high in people with the condition. While the root cause of PCOS is unclear, it involves imbalances in several hormones, including too much testosterone being made by the ovaries. This can lead to irregular menstrual cycles and infertility, as well as acne and excess body hair, among other symptoms.

While investigating the effects of different drugs on fat cells in mice, Qi-Qun Tang at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, noticed that artemisinin reduced symptoms in mice with a condition similar to PCOS. His team later gave artemisinin to 19 women with PCOS for three months. It lowered levels of testosterone in all of them, and most also saw a decrease in another substance called anti-Müllerian hormone, which has been linked to PCOS. For 12 of the participants, the drug also led to regular menstrual cycles. In other work in mice and in human cells, the team found that artemisinin seems to reduce testosterone production in the ovaries. Stephen Franks at Imperial College London says artemisinin could act through a different mechanism by improving insulin sensitivity, as losing weight tends to reduce PCOS symptoms, although the 19 women had a healthy body mass index on average. “If the results are as good in a randomised trial as in this preliminary study, it’s exciting,” he says. Elisabet Stener-Victorin at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, says the fact that artemisinin is already generally safe when used for malaria means it could be quickly turned into a new treatment for PCOS.

The approach has succeeded in editing DNA in hard-to-reach lung stem cells in mice, with modifications that endured for at least 22 months – essentially the animals’ entire lives, says Daniel Siegwart at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  Read moremRNA cancer therapy now in human trials after shrinking mouse tumours  Read more mRNA cancer therapy now in human trials after shrinking mouse tumours Advertisement “I was falling out of my chair with amazement after seeing a few months of persistence,” he says. “This is exciting news for potential treatment of a variety of lung ailments.” Cystic fibrosis is caused by genetic mutations that lead to sticky mucus building up in the lungs and digestive system. Scientists have previously developed gene-editing technologies to modify the DNA in the faulty lung cells. But getting the therapeutic agents into those cells is a challenge due to the mucus and other defences that have evolved to keep pathogens out of the lungs, says Siegwart. Get the most essential health and fitness news in your inbox every Saturday. A possible solution is to deliver the molecular tools for gene editing through the blood, packaged in lipid nanoparticles that slip past immune barriers. Similar nanoparticles have already been used in more than a billion mRNA covid-19 vaccines, and other teams have successfully delivered gene therapy into people’s livers in this way. However, lipid nanoparticles naturally end up in the liver, says Siegwart. So, a few years ago, he and his team tweaked these agents to make them specifically target the lungs. In the latest study, Siegwart and his colleagues injected eight-week-old mice with lung-targeting lipid nanoparticles carrying CRISPR gene-editing components, together with a marker that enabled them to identify gene-edited cells. Over the next 22 months, the researchers regularly analysed the animals’ lung tissue and found the marker throughout the mice’s lungs every time. The results were surprising, says Siegwart, because individual lung cells usually live for only three weeks at most. However, because the treatment affects the stem cells, which continually divide and produce new cells, the gene editing appears to form a replenishing pool of edited mature cells. The researchers then ran tests in their laboratory using cells taken from people with cystic fibrosis who have a specific genetic mutation. They found that the gene-editing system embedded in the nanoparticle successfully corrected the mutation in those cells.  Read moreHow to tell if your immune system is weak or strong  Read more How to tell if your immune system is weak or strong Finally, they injected their treatment into the veins of mice that had been genetically modified to have that same cystic fibrosis mutation. Within 10 days, the treatment had already corrected the mutation in 50 per cent of the animals’ lung stem cells. Marianne Carlon and Mattijs Bulcaen, both at KU Leuven in Belgium, praised this new approach – which achieved what all previous efforts couldn’t. “More than 27 clinical trials for cystic fibrosis gene therapy have failed to find a way past the airway epithelial barrier,” they state in a paper commenting on the study. “The fact that they can reach these stem cells at very high efficiency via delivery of their lung-targeted lipid nanoparticles to the bloodstream of mice is very impressive – and a first in the gene therapy field for genetic lung diseases,” Carlon tells New Scientist. If approved for human trials, the therapy would be administered to adults and would target the lung cells only, says Siegwart. If effective, cystic fibrosis patients “could expect lung function similar to healthy adults” and the benefit would last as long as the cells themselves last, he says. “Genome correction has the potential to generate years or perhaps a lifetime of benefit, which could dramatically improve quality of life,” he says.

The analysis found that some calls from African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) seem to contain name-like components specific to certain individuals. What’s more, those individuals know their names, responding more strongly than others do when calls addressed to them are played back on a speaker. 


 Advertisement  Read moreDr Dolittle machines: How AI is helping us talk to the animals  Read more Dr Dolittle machines: How AI is helping us talk to the animals “I had noticed from years back that when an elephant gave a contact rumble, within a group of elephants I would see one individual lift its head, listen and give an answer,” says Joyce Poole at ElephantVoices, a small organisation that studies elephants and aims to protect them. “And the rest seemed to just ignore the elephant. So I did wonder whether the calls were being directed toward a specific individual.” More than 600 recordings made by Poole and others have now been analysed by Michael Pardo at Colorado State University and his colleagues. The recordings included contact rumbles, made when the recipient is out of sight, and greeting rumbles, made when one elephant approaches another. The researchers knew which individuals were calling and responding in each case. A monthly celebration of the biodiversity of our planet’s animals, plants and other organisms. In a quarter of cases, the software created by the team was able to predict which individual was being addressed, a result significantly better than chance. The researchers then played back some of the rumbles to pairs of elephants, including the “named” individual. They found that the named elephant responded more strongly: they approached the speaker faster, made calls in response faster and also made more calls altogether than the other individual that wasn’t addressed by name. Dolphins and several species of birds have been shown to call to specific individuals by imitating the sound made by the animal they are calling. However, while Poole reported in 2005 that elephants can learn to mimic sounds, the team found no evidence that the elephants were mimicking each other. In other words, they seem to be using arbitrary sounds as names, just as humans do, says Poole. What the analysis didn’t reveal is whether different elephants share the same name for one specific individual. It could be that each elephant has its own set of names for others. “With us, we have formal names, but different individuals may refer to the same person with different nicknames,” says Poole. “So it may be something like that. I don’t think we know yet.” “This is a super interesting study with multiple lines of evidence suggesting that African elephants not only produce individually specific vocalisations – which is commonly reported in many species – but more importantly respond specifically when they hear their own individually specific vocalisation given by another elephant,” says Daniel Blumstein at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The idea that elephants can use individually specific vocalisations to attract specific individuals is novel, exciting and opens the door to a much more nuanced understanding of the rich social lives that these animals have,” he says. “I find the results quite plausible,” says Thorsten Balsby at Aarhus University in Denmark. Balsby studies parrots that live in much larger groups. He points out that in large populations with hundreds or thousands of individuals, learning names would be very difficult. “Addressing other individuals by imitation is a simpler solution that does not require prior interactions,” he says. A 2005 study reported that green-rumped parrotlets kept in captivity “vocally labelled”, or named, their companions, says Balsby. But they did so with different versions of their contact call. “So it might not be quite as arbitrary as the elephants,” he says. Poole thinks her study is just the beginning when it comes to understanding elephant communication. “There are layers of complexity in elephant communication that are going to take some time to unravel, so I think we’ll have lots more exciting discoveries in the years to come,” she says. For instance, she suspects elephants might use place names too. “When they’re giving their ‘let’s go’ rumbles, where they indicate the direction they want to go to other individuals in the group, they might actually be saying precisely where they want to go,” says Poole.

New research is revealing the surprising brain and mental health benefits of semaglutide drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, and other related diabetes and weight-loss drugs that mimic a gut hormone released after eating. It is early days, but there are hints that these drugs could be repurposed to treat depression, anxiety, addiction and even certain eating disorders – as well as neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s. What’s more, it seems that these effects aren’t just mediated via weight loss, but through direct action on the brain.

Widely known for wanting to “de-extinct” the woolly mammoth, it said it was making strides in the genetic engineering of dodo-like birds, which would then be brought to Mauritius, one of the Indian Ocean’s Mascarene islands and the dodo’s sole habitat before extinction. As conservation director at the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, Tatayah had worked for decades to conserve the nation’s surviving endemic species, from the Mauritius fruit bat to the pink pigeon, a dodo relative. So he was surprised that his organisation wasn’t in the loop – and somewhat sceptical of the motives behind the multi-million-dollar project. “I was the first to say, ‘Hold on. There are a lot of other species of plants and animals on Mauritius that are threatened. That money could be better spent.'”  Read moreEvolution is evolving: 13 ways we must rethink the theory of nature  Read more Evolution is evolving: 13 ways we must rethink the theory of nature Whether genetic engineering should be used for conservation remains contentious, and many are especially wary of de-extinction. But a year later, Tatayah sees the potential return of the dodo as a way to simultaneously rescue endangered species – in particular the pink pigeon. “We are very keen for the dodo to be brought back,” he says. Often overlooked is that the biotech breakthroughs Colossal and others are working on could have important collateral benefits. They could clear a path to using genetic tools to quickly help a whole range of animals resist the pressures they face from a changing environment. “The pace of change is faster than evolution by natural… Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

The extra warming that would result from such emissions is calculated to lead to extreme weather around the world with impacts amounting to $32 billion.

Get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox every month. That group today released its fourth assessment of the impact of the war, covering February 2022 to February 2024. The reconstruction of bombed buildings, roads and other infrastructure is the single largest source of emissions, it found, accounting for nearly a third of the 175 megatonnes. Its figure includes reconstruction that has yet to occur. Another third is a direct result of warfare, with fuel use being the biggest part of this. Around 14 per cent of the total is due to passenger airlines having to reroute flights to avoid Russia and Ukraine. For instance, flights from Tokyo to London now go over Canada rather than Russia, increasing flying time from 11 to 15 hours. About 13 per cent is due to the increase in landscape fires, as recorded by satellites. This isn’t just due to weapons causing fires, but also to the ending of fire management in occupied areas, the assessment says. There are large uncertainties in the figures, as there are no official numbers to rely on in most cases. Instead, the group has to turn to the likes of open-source assessments or figures from previous conflicts. There is also the question of how far to go in assessing the knock-on effects of the war. “We try to be as comprehensive as possible,” de Klerk says. “At the same time, there are limitations, some effects maybe that are too distant or too difficult to quantify.”  Read moreA hydrogen fuel revolution is coming – here's why we might not want it  Read more A hydrogen fuel revolution is coming – here's why we might not want it Estimating how much harm will result from additional emissions – known as the social cost of carbon – is another tricky area. “The science on trying to put a monetary value on those future damages is still evolving,” says de Klerk. The estimate of $32 billion is based on a 2022 study putting the social cost of carbon at around $185 per tonne of CO2. Should this sum – which is rising daily – ever be paid, de Klerk thinks some should go to Ukraine to be used for measures such as restoring forests, to help recapture some of the carbon. Another slice should go to the countries being hit hardest by global heating, he thinks, perhaps via an existing system called the Green Climate Fund. But where the money would go is a political decision that remains to be resolved. For decades, low-income and island nations have fought to establish the principle that high-emitting, high-income countries should pay for the losses and damages caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. A loss-and-damage fund was finally set up last year as part of international climate agreements. Topics: Advertisement Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!
