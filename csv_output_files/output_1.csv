The Ministry of Health in Gaza said “large numbers” of killed and wounded on Saturday were arriving at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, the majority of them children and women. “Dozens of injured people are lying on the ground, and medical teams are trying to save them with the basic medical capabilities they have available,” it said, adding that it is short on medicine and food, and that its main generator has stopped functioning due to a lack of fuel. A Health Ministry spokesman earlier said that there were still “a lot of” bodies and wounded people that remained on the streets. Communications were affected amid the intense bombardment, but reporting from inside the “overwhelmed” hospital via a telephone call, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the situation is tense, with terrified people on the street not knowing where to turn. “There are explosions happening every minute. Ambulances are transferring the wounded to the hospital where we are trapped. It’s chaos inside the hospital. There are children among the wounded,” she said. Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan, a paediatric intensive care doctor with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), described Al-Aqsa Hospital as a “complete bloodbath”, adding that it looked “like a slaughterhouse”. The devastating attacks took place as Israeli forces conducted a rescue operation in Nuseirat to free four Israeli captives. At least one Israeli captive was killed in the operation.

1,Gerald Nesmith Jr,The fallacy of the ‘wrong side of history’ narrative,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/6/9/the-fallacy-of-the-wrong-side-of-history-narrative,"Waiting on history to deliver karmic justice is a useless exercise, especially at a time when urgent action is needed.",2024-06-09T13:11:32Z,"Waiting on history to deliver karmic justice for war crimes is a useless exercise, especially at a time when urgent action is needed. Over the past nine months, we have witnessed one of the most well-documented instances of genocide unfold in the Gaza Strip. Across the world, there has been a tremendous amount of mobilisation and genuine disruption in protest of this atrocity. The United States, too, has seen large demonstrations and protest actions against the government’s unwavering support for the Israeli Occupation Forces and leadership. In the midst of this, a longstanding and useless narrative has re-emerged. Many have denounced officials supporting Israel for being on the wrong side of history and actively being in favour of what will go down in the public record as a genocide. There is an expectation that somehow history will hold them to account. But if the historical record was truly a concern for those in power, the president of the United States would not be taking questions about the genocidal carnage unfolding daily while chowing down on a double scoop of mint chip ice cream. This idea is borne out of a need to soothe the Western conscience. And it is not out of a lack of awareness of history that this narrative takes hold; in fact, it’s often the exact opposite. For those who learn of the many historical tragedies and atrocities that our current world order is built on, there seems to be a need for some type of higher justice. A justice more lasting than simply some bad polling for a few months and some scathing op-eds. But what the “wrong side of history” narrative really does is undermine our ability to engage with the very real conditions of the present. To get to the point where we can move on from viewing history as a form of karmic justice for the most powerful members of our society, we must first understand our relationship with it. There is a tendency to treat history like a bullet-point presentation of the highlights and not the singular story of our existence on this planet. It is as if we are experiencing events in a vacuum, as if we do not actually exist in a context shaped by the past. This often leads to a superficial or incomplete perception of historical reality. As James Baldwin wrote in a 1965 essay titled The White Man’s Guilt for Ebony magazine: “people who imagine that history flatters them […] are impaled on their history like a butterfly on a pin and become incapable of seeing or changing themselves, or the world”. He is correct in this assessment but what he and many of us today fail to consider is just how far the most powerful members of our society will go to remove any of the heavy guilt of history from their shoulders.  
 A good example of what I mean is the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King Jr. During his lifetime he was wildly unpopular with the American public. It wasn’t until years after his death that the minds of the majority slowly began to change. Today some see the proliferation of Dr King’s message as proof that history can provide the sense of justice that people are seeking. I believe this is untrue for two reasons. First, saying history vindicated MLK largely neglects the actual mechanism for change that he helped set up. It wasn’t out of the goodness of their souls that the majority of Americans embraced MLK’s message. Rather it was the day in and day out concerted efforts of the Black community that brought about that change. Second, Dr King’s legacy has been significantly diluted in the public arena to make it more palatable to the majority. A man, whose beliefs and philosophy were based in the radical anticapitalist and anti-imperialist tradition, has been reduced to a little more than the patron saint of white guilt. The distortion of MLK’s legacy is just one example of how history can be twisted to make it more easily digestible or useful to white supremacist power structures. This process has been brought to an extreme with recent efforts to rewrite Black history. In Florida, for example, local authorities changed teaching standards for Black history to the point that students are now taught that slavery brought “personal benefit” to Black people. And just as history can be used in the public realm to distort the memory and understanding of struggles against oppression, it can also be used to whitewash oppressors. In recent years, we have seen how the legacies of leaders like George W Bush and Ronald Reagan, have been carefully rehabilitated. Instead of facing calls for accountability for war crimes during the so-called “war on terror”, Bush is now enjoying retirement, painting portraits, attending public events and commenting on news developments as a respected former official. Meanwhile, Reagan, whose atrocity portfolio stretches from funding death squads in Latin America to supporting the racist apartheid regime of South Africa, is celebrated by Democrats and Republicans alike for his moxie and past policies. It is not that the most powerful people among us do not care about their legacies when they make decisions. It is that they know they have the resources and sway to change public perception while they are alive or that the “civility” argument will be used to temper criticism after their death, regardless of all the crimes against humanity they may have committed. It is dangerous to perceive history as the ultimate equaliser not only because it is not but also because it dampens motivation to engage in real initiatives for change by giving an easy outlet to our feelings of helplessness and anxiety. We must realise that to ensure the maintenance of accurate accounts of history, we have to rely on our greatest tool: organising and the lessons from those who organised before us. In his pivotal book, A People’s History of the United States, historian Howard Zinn wrote: “The memory of oppressed people is one thing that cannot be taken away, and for such people, with such memories, revolt is always an inch below the surface.” 
 Indeed, memory and revolt are closely intertwined. Those who know and are aware of their own history, also engage in actively making it; they do not remain passive onlookers. Holding the powerful to account is not a fool’s errand and organising is the way to do it. Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu, and all of those responsible for the ever-rising death toll in Palestine are relying on the uncomfortable fact that when it comes to killing done in service of American interest, many in the West have very short memories. Expecting history to hold these individuals accountable for actions they committed in service of a system of oppression is useless. It may bring temporary relief of anxiety, but ultimately, it paralyses us at a time when urgent action is needed. Injustice is not naturally remedied by history. It is challenged and fought by people who mobilise to dismantle systems of oppression.

The government, meanwhile, has been more preoccupied with cooling down animals at state-run zoos across the country, giving lions frozen meat lollies. It is not the only frosty treat: one rescue group is feeding distressed owls with rat carcasses shipped in frozen from Mexico City. A heat dome, an area of strong high pressure centred over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America, has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures across Mexico and the United States. Much of the impact on wildlife is being felt in central and southern Mexico, because while temperatures are also high in the north, it is mostly desert and the animals there have some coping mechanisms for extreme heat and drought. On the steamy gulf coast, an animal park has set up air-conditioned rooms for eagles, owls and other birds of prey. In the south, howler monkeys continue to fall dead of the trees with heatstroke. Deaths now probably number more than 250. In the southern state of Tabasco, the few monkeys that can be saved from dehydration and heat stroke are mostly being saved by NGOs like the Biodiversity Conservation of the Usumacinta group. Known by its initials as COBIUS, the group has saved and stabilised 18 monkeys. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo, the head of the group, has been accompanying teams of biologists and veterinarians out into the jungle to look for ailing monkeys. Many times, they get there too late. “Yesterday we lost three of the animals,” Pozo said as he bounced in a truck along a rural road in the southern gulf coast state of Tabasco, the worst-hit area. “We went out to rescue them. We couldn’t stabilise them.” The monkeys — midsized primates known for their roaring calls — were too far gone with a kind of severe fluid loss as Mexico grapples with drought along with heat. As of May 31, the environment department acknowledged that a total of 204 howler monkeys had died, 157 of them in Tabasco. Pozo said the number in Tabasco alone has since risen to 198, suggesting the nationwide toll is now near 250. “The only rescue plan or programme is the one our organisation is doing,” Pozo said. Amid budget cuts for many environmental agencies, the government now has to rely on NGOs. Follow Al Jazeera English:"
4,Al Jazeera,Clashes erupt between police and protesters as Argentina debates reform,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/6/13/clashes-between-police-and-protesters-erupt-as-argentina-debates-reform,President Javier Milei seeks to pass a key bill that would privatise public industry and implement austerity measures.,2024-06-13T01:39:16Z,"In Pictures Violent protests have erupted on the streets of Buenos Aires, as Argentina’s Senate debates the passage of a key bill that would advance President Javier Milei’s economic overhaul. Thousands of protesters gathered in the shadow of the country’s domed Congress building on Wednesday, in a demonstration against the proposed austerity measures contained in the wide-reaching bill. But while the day began with street barbecues, picketing and protest songs, tensions rose in the afternoon as debate unfolded inside the congressional building. Riot police armed with helmets, batons and clear, plastic shields arrived to disperse the crowds. They deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, spraying protesters bundled against the winter cold. Local media reported that several opposition lawmakers who were among the crowd, including Juan Manuel Pedrini, had to be transferred to a nearby hospital to treat burns to their eyes and skin. “A sad day for Argentinian democracy,” said a social media account for the Union for the Homeland, a Peronist political party representing the opposition. It declared its “absolute repudiation of the repression perpetrated by the police”. Milei’s government, meanwhile, pointed to the violent tactics some protesters allegedly used as the afternoon wore on. Officials said 18 people had been detained after reports emerged of rock-throwing and the use of sticks as weapons. A car belonging to the radio station Cadena 3 was also set on fire. Waldo Wolff, the minister of justice and security for the city of Buenos Aires, said one person was even found “with a grenade”. “The culture of violence that sets the pace for demonstrations is at an end,” he wrote on the social media platform X. “In addition to the 18 detained, we are going to take the images to the justice system so that everyone who broke sidewalks [and] burned cars and trash cans will pay.” The administration of President Milei went further, accusing the demonstrators of attempting to overthrow the government and disrupt Congress’s proceedings. “We went to protect Congress, and they responded with stones and fire,” Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said on X. The social media account for the executive office issued a message as well, congratulating the armed forces “for their excellent actions in repressing the terrorist groups that, with sticks, stones and even grenades, attempted to perpetrate a coup d’état”. The bill at the heart of the unrest — called the “Ley de Bases” or the “Law of Bases” — is set to advance Milei’s libertarian agenda, as he attempts to privatise public companies, beef up his executive powers and rev up the economy. In Argentina, annual inflation continues to rise, currently sitting at a rate of nearly 300 percent. As costs spiral, poverty is increasing. Milei says his austerity measures will bring inflation and the country’s sovereign debt under control — but his critics predict the steep cuts will only worsen the situation. The bill previously passed in Congress’s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, in late April after months of negotiations and a failed vote in February. But political observers believe the bill faces an even higher climb in the opposition-controlled Senate. The Peronist Union for the Homeland holds 33 of the chamber’s 72 seats, compared with seven for Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party. Follow Al Jazeera English:"

At least 49 people have been killed after a fire broke out in a building that housed workers in Kuwait, according to authorities. The blaze early on Wednesday morning in the southern Mangaf district also injured dozens of people, the Health Ministry said. The area is heavily populated with foreign labourers, but there was no immediate information on the nationality of the casualties. Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Fahad al-Yousuf al-Sabah ordered the arrest of the building’s owner during a visit to the site. “Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters,” said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defence ministries. Authorities said the fire had been brought under control and were investigating what caused it. Later on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry revised the death toll up to 49, from 41 issued earlier, after forensic teams scoured the charred building. “The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire,” a senior police commander told state TV. “We always alert and warn against” cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers’ type of employment or place of origin.

Tens of thousands of men in vibrant attire, henna-dyed beards and bright headgear thronged around the Muslim shrine nestled at the base of a mountain, to pay their respects last week. Worshippers raised their hands and cried out their wishes. Some also tied multicoloured threads around the trees at the shrine, which represented their prayers. The shrine to Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanwi has its origins in the 19th century and provides free meals all year to devotees, most of them from Kashmir’s nomadic pastoral community. Devotees believe their wishes are granted at the shrine. Kiyanwi, originally from Kashmir, migrated to the Hazara region of modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan during the late 19th century. There, he was mentored by a Sufi saint and later returned to Kashmir to preach Islam. After he died, the shrine was built as a mark of respect towards him – a manifestation of the region’s unique ties with Sufism. Abdul Razaq, a devotee, said that he has been visiting the shrine since he was six and feels blessed by paying obeisance there. “I remember as a kid we had to travel a lot by foot, but things have changed, and today we can reach the shrine in a day,” he said. Another devotee, Mohammad Farooq, who is visually impaired, said: “It would have been great if I could see things for myself, but I find peace when I visit the shrine.” Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety, is a Muslim-majority region. Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir’s independence, a goal supported by a large number of Muslims in the disputed territory. The region has remained embroiled in civil strife for decades and the shrine, including hundreds of others strewn around its landscape, has been and continues to be, far more than a mere spiritual retreat for Muslims. Many worshippers find these shrines a rare space far removed from unrelenting political tensions in the region. Follow Al Jazeera English:"
