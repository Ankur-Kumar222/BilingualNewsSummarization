0,,Adam Silver says finalizing the new media rights deals is 'complex' process,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-says-finalizing-the-new-media-rights-deals-is-complex-process,"Getting the NBA’s next round of media rights deals completed is an extremely complex proposition, Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday.",2024-06-07T01:28:10Z,"Getting the NBA's next round of media rights deals completed is an extremely complex proposition, Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday, especially because nobody can say with any certainty what the viewing landscape will look like in the future. Silver, speaking in his annual pre-NBA Finals news conference, did not offer any hints on when the next series of deals will be completed, other than saying ""in the relative near term."" The current deals with ABC-ESPN and Turner Sports expire after next season and the NBA has been talking with NBC, ESPN and Amazon, among other networks and platforms, about what comes next. ""It's complicated for several reasons,"" Silver said. ""One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming and the interest of streaming companies and in the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms. It's complicated because with multiple partners, all seeking similar assets in many cases, you're just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners."" The expectation, from networks and others involved in the process, is that the new agreements will be for 11 years and could exceed $70 billion in total value. Those would smash the existing norms for both value and deal length; the current one is nine years, $24 billion. ""We tend to do long-term deals,"" Silver said. ""We think that's good for the stability of the league. But it means to a certain extent you're trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible. Part of it is a bet on the partners that we'll ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and to become global, which is very important to the league as well."" What remains most unclear is how, or if, Turner will remain involved with the NBA when the new deals get struck. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav sounded an ominous note in late 2022, saying that Turner and WBD ""don't have to have the NBA"" once their current deal expires. If WBD is not part of the next deals, one of the most recognizable changes for fans could be the demise of the highly popular ""Inside the NBA"" program featuring former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny Smith. ""That show, in particular, is special."" Silver said. When the deals get done — whether it's in the coming days, weeks or even months — it would clear the way for the next major item on the NBA's to-do list, that being expansion. Silver has been very clear on the order of his top agenda items in recent seasons, those being preserving labor peace (which was achieved with the new Collective Bargaining Agreement) and getting a new media deal (talks ongoing). Then the league, at some point, will turn its attention toward adding new franchises. ""By turning to expansion, it doesn't mean that we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams,"" Silver said. ""It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. ... I actually am looking forward to that. I think the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there."" In other topics covered by Silver: Silver didn't opine on the hard foul that Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark took from Chicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter last weekend, a play that has been scrutinized in countless ways from countless parties. ""As a fan, obviously, it's nothing new in basketball that there's sort of welcome-to-the-league moments, especially for heralded rookies,"" Silver said. ""But of course, I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league. I would say, seems like she can take care of herself. She's a tough player."" Silver calls Clark ""an incredible talent"" and says all the attention she helps bring is good for the game — while noting that the growth of the fan base for the women's game didn't start just now, either. He also said it can't be ignored that there are ""larger societal issues at work ... some having to do with race"" when discussing the attention Clark generates and how that is received. ""Sports, historically, has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues,"" Silver said. ""I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage about these issues."" Silver said he believed the $750,000 fine the NBA issued to the Dallas Mavericks was appropriate last season, after a brief investigation showed the team engaged in ""conduct detrimental to the league"" by sitting out most of its key players against the Chicago Bulls on April 7, 2023. The Mavs still had a chance to reach the playoffs, but the NBA said it believed the team made its roster decisions that night ""in order to improve the chances of keeping its first-round pick in the 2023 NBA Draft."" That pick became Dereck Lively II, who has played a significant role for the Mavericks in their run to the NBA Finals. ""In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time,"" Silver said. ""I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they're now seeing in the playoffs and here they are at the finals, I don't attribute it to one draft pick — as important as that draft pick has been to their team.""

1,,Jalen Hurts on Kellen Moore's Eagles offense: '95 percent of it is new',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/jalen-hurts-kellen-moores-eagles-offense-95-percent-new,"New Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore is bringing an almost entirely different system to Philadelphia, according to quarterback Jalen Hurts.",2024-06-07T00:39:21Z,"The Philadelphia Eagles replaced their coordinators on both sides of the ball after a stunning late-season collapse from the 2022 NFC Champions, including hiring Kellen Moore to run their offense. Moore spent four years as the offensive coordinator for the archrival Dallas Cowboys before one ill-fated season with the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023. While Moore has shown the ability to adapt to offensive-minded head coaches like Jason Garrett and Mike McCarthy during his career as an NFL playcaller, it appears he is bringing a completely new style to Nick Sirianni's Eagles, according to quarterback Jalen Hurts. ""Right now it's been a lot of new inventory,"" Hurts said, via ESPN. ""The majority of it, probably 95% of it being new — and so it's just been that process, and it's been a fun process because you get to see what works for other people. ""I think the goal coming in was to learn Kellen's offense and to master it, and I think that's been a process, and by the end of it, I want it to be mine and have it in my own way."" Sirianni, like Moore's former Cowboys bosses, has roots on the offensive side of the ball, as the Eagles hired him in 2021 after he had been the Indianapolis Colts' offensive coordinator. Sirianni has since called plays at times during his time in Philadelphia, but the playcalling ability of well-regarded offensive coordinator Shane Steichen — who left, ironically, to replace Sirianni's former boss Frank Reich as the Colts' head coach last year — was seen as a major catalyst in the team's 2022 run to the Super Bowl where they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. Hurts' quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2023 after Steichen's departure, but his playcalling came under criticism as the Eagles slumped to a 1-5 regular-season finish and wild-card-round loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the playoffs after starting the season 10-1. Johnson was later fired along with defensive coordinator Sean Desai, who was replaced by veteran defensive guru Vic Fangio. The Eagles return a loaded offense around Hurts, though they will have to replace perennial Pro Bowl center Jason Kelce on the offensive line following Kelce's retirement earlier this offseason. Still, Philadelphia features star receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert as Hurts' primary pass-catching targets, and signed star running back Saquon Barkley away from the division-rival New York Giants when 2024 NFL free agency opened in March.  They will open the 2024 season against the Green Bay Packers in Brazil, marking the first NFL game in South America.

3,,Dornoch pulls of upset to win first Belmont Stakes run at Saratoga Race Course with 17-1 odds,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/dornoch-pulls-upset-win-first-belmont-stakes-run-saratoga-race-course-17-1-odds,"Dornoch won the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday; Mindframe finished second, with Sierra Leone coming in third.",2024-06-08T23:11:36Z,"Dornoch pulled off a major upset to take the first Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, hugging the rail and holding off Mindframe to win the Triple Crown finale. From a betting perspective, Dornoch went off at 17-1 odds. The horse co-owned by World Series champion Jayson Werth won the Belmont five weeks after a troubled trip led to a 10th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby. This time, Dornoch sat off leader Seize the Grey, passed the Preakness winner down the stretch and held on. It's the first win in any Triple Crown for trainer Danny Gargan and the second in the Belmont for jockey Luis Saez. ""He's one of the top 3-year-olds in the country, and we've always thought it,"" Gargan said. 'We let him run his race and he won. If he gets to run, he's always going to be tough to beat. It's the sixth consecutive year a different horse won each of the three Triple Crown races. Sierra Leone, the Derby runner-up who went off as the favorite, was third and Honor Marie fourth. ""When I rode this horse here in Saratoga for the first time (July 29), I told Danny, ‘You have the Derby winner,'"" Saez said. ""Unfortunately, the Derby's a crazy race and we draw that No. 1 hole. Today, we have pretty good confidence that we could win this race."" Despite there not being a Triple Crown on the line, it's a historic Belmont because the race was run at Saratoga for the first time in the venue's 161-year history. It returns next year while Belmont Park undergoes a massive, $455 reconstruction with the plan for the Triple Crown to return to the New York track in 2026. Having it at Saratoga necessitated shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles from the usual ""test of the champion 1 1/2-mile distance that has been a hallmark of the Belmont for nearly a century. The temporary change contributed to getting more quality horses into the field who previously ran in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness or both. Reporting by The Associated Press.

The friendly matches were the last for Spain and Croatia before they open the tournament against one another on June 15 in Berlin. They are in a tough Group B along with Italy and Albania. Spain fine-tuned its attack with a 5-1 rout of Northern Ireland. Pedri González led the way with his first two goals for his nation. Portugal has one more friendly — against Ireland on Tuesday — before it starts the competition against the Czech Republic on June 18 in Leipzig. Portugal is the favorite in Group F that also includes Turkey and Georgia. Cristiano Ronaldo never left Portugal's bench, with coach Roberto Martínez tapping Gonçalo Ramos to spear his attack. Ronaldo joined Portugal on Friday after finishing his club campaign with Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. The 39-year-old is set to make a record sixth appearance at the European Championship. Men's soccer all-time leading scorer with 128 goals, Ronaldo helped Portugal win the European title in 2016. Modric beat goalkeeper Diogo Costa to open the scoring in the eighth minute at Portugal's National Stadium near Lisbon. The 38-year-old Real Madrid midfielder was sent to the penalty spot after Vitinha fouled Mateo Kovacic in the area. Halftime substitutes Diogo Jota and Nelson Semedo linked up to equalize for the hosts in the 48th, with Semedo assisting the Liverpool forward to tap in. Ante Budimir restored Croatia's advantage in the 56th after the Osasuna striker headed in a rebound of a strike by Mario Pašalić that Costa had done well to push onto the crossbar. Costa twice denied Nikola Vlašić to save Portugal from a heavier defeat. Modric was substituted in the 54th. His contract with Madrid is set to expire at the end of the month following a season when he lost his starting role in Carlo Ancelotti's side. But the former Ballon d'Or winner seemed to indicate he wants to continue playing for the Spanish club when he told its fans in the celebrations of Champions League title No. 15 that he would see them ""next season."" Euro 2024 kicks off on Friday when host Germany plays Scotland. SPAIN WINS Northern Ireland's Daniel Ballard stunned Spain with a second-minute header. But Luis de la Fuente's team powered past their overmatched opponent in Mallorca. Pedri scored twice in the first half for his first goals in his 20th appearance for Spain. The Barcelona midfielder, now 21, helped Spain reach the semifinals of Euro 2021 but had not played since the 2022 World Cup due to injury. He made his return in Spain's 5-0 win over Andorra on Wednesday. Álvaro Morata, Fabián Ruiz, and Mikel Oyarzabal, who put in three against Andorra, also chipped in with goals. OTHER FRIENDLIES Romelu Lukaku scored twice and Arsenal's Leandro Trossard added a third goal as Belgium brushed aside Luxembourg 3-0. Belgium is expected to advance from a Group E that includes Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania. Serbia rolled to a 3-0 win in Sweden thanks to goals by Sergej Milinković-Savić, Aleksandar Mitrović and Dušan Tadić. England and Serbia open play on June 16 in Group C that also includes Denmark and Slovenia. Denmark bettered Norway 3-1, with Erling Haaland getting the loser's only goal. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jannik Vestergaard, and Yussuf Poulsen found the net for the Danes. Slovenia needed goalie Jan Oblak to make a stoppage-time save to ensure a 1-1 draw with Bulgaria. Switzerland and Austria drew 1-1 after Silvan Widmer leveled for the Swiss following an early goal by Christoph Baumgartner. Austria and France will face off in their opener on June 17. They are in Group D with the Netherlands and Poland. Switzerland has been drawn in Group A with Germany, Scotland and Hungary, which got a brace from Barnabás Varga to defeat Israel 3-0.

5,Doug McIntyre,Colombia 5-1 USMNT: U.S. embarrassed in first Copa América tuneup,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/colombia-5-1-usmnt-u-s-embarrassed-first-copa-america-tuneup,The U.S. men's national team suffered an embarrassing 5-1 loss to Colombia on Saturday in its first friendly match before the 2024 Copa América.,2024-06-09T00:34:03Z,"It's admirable that the U.S. men's national team wanted to schedule a pair of world soccer heavyweights to prepare for this summer's Copa América on home soil. The risk, of course, was getting embarrassed in the process. That's exactly how Saturday's 5-1 loss to Colombia in the Americans' first pre-Copa tuneup match played out.  In front of a large, mostly pro-Cafeteros crowd in Landover, Maryland, the visitors took an early lead and never really looked back. Jhon Arias scored by taking advantage of a defensive miscue by the U.S. before six minutes had elapsed, and Rafael Santos Borré doubled his country's advantage before the first half had even reached the midway point. [Check out our 2024 Copa América preview] Colombia scored three more times in the final quarter-hour to complete the rout after Tim Weah had provided the only bright spot all evening for the U.S. Weah briefly cut the deficit to 2-1 with a well-taken goal early in the second half. ""I think everybody needs to look in the mirror after that game,"" U.S. keeper Matt Turner told broadcaster TNT afterward. ""It's really, really disappointing in front of such a great crowd, so I want to apologize to the fans as well. Because that's not what we're about. And yeah, we need to bounce back in a big way."" The U.S. won't have much time to dwell on the lopsided defeat with an even more daunting opponent, five-time World Cup champion Brazil, looming in its next preparation game on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida. Santos Borré's strike was a worthy game-winner. A defection following a Colombian corner kick saw the ball ping pong around the penalty area before eventually falling to the forward unmarked with his back to Turner's goal. Santos Borré' leaped into the air and executed a close-range bicycle kick that left Turner little time to react: Arias's opener set the tone early when he pounced on an attempted Antonee Robinson clearance, danced past Robinson's Fulham teammate Tim Ream and beat Turner at his near post. It was the worst possible start for the U.S. Even at that stage, there was a feeling that this might not be the Americans' day: Key stat With a 53-47 possession advantage, the U.S. had the majority of the ball after falling behind. They weren't efficient with it, though, as the visitors outshot them 15-10, including a 6-2 advantage in on-target attempts. Oh, nothing special — just the most celebrated international team of all time. With a 1W-18L-0 record versus Brazil, it's a matchup nightmare for the U.S. The Americans have lost 11 straight meeting since their lone victory over the Seleção all the way back in 1998. Still, the U.S. can't be much worse on Wednesday, right? Result aside, Gregg Berhalter's team was more rusty and/or sloppy for most of the way on Saturday as opposed to downright terrible. All five goals against came as a result of mistakes that, in theory at least, are preventable. It was a humiliating and embarrassing loss nonetheless, to be sure. Saturday's harsh lesson could still serve the Copa hosts well when the tournament arrives, especially if they get another crack at Colombia in the knockout stage. If you're going to lose 5-1, it better be in game that doesn't count. ""Obviously, it's a learning experience for all of the boys and myself tonight.,"" Weah said. ""But I'm ready to go again. I'm ready to face another good opponent. I'm ready to bounce back.""

The main takeaway? Add more teams, make it bigger.",2024-06-10T00:52:36Z,"Now that Major League Baseball has been to London three times, players have a few suggestions for future visits. The New York Mets beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-5 on Sunday to split their two-game weekend series at London Stadium. Both teams arrived Thursday morning and had two off days to get acclimated. They went sightseeing before getting back in game mode. ""I feel like we had too much time off,"" Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor said before Sunday's game. ""I get it, there's a process of you've got to sell the games and stuff like that. But to me ... playing the next day (Friday) would have been a little bit more beneficial."" Lindor still called the whole experience ""fantastic"" and important in spreading the game. A soccer-style knee slide by Phillies slugger Bryce Harper garnered some media coverage in Britain. Mets infielder Jeff McNeil likes an idea floated by Harper — to have more teams come and hold a cup-style tournament. ""It would be cool if you had four teams here — you could get five, six games,"" he said after New York's win. ""It is tough coming over here for two games and then flying back to the States. If you could get more teams over here, make it more of an event, it would be a lot of fun."" This was MLB's third trip to London in the past five years. There's another series planned for 2026. A proposed series in Paris for next summer was shelved. ""I'd do it every year if we could,"" said Phillies manager Rob Thomson, who visited a Philly-themed bar. ""It's been a great experience. Tough loss today, but it was a great ballgame for fans to watch."" HIGH FLYERS The Phillies will have crossed 18 different time zones in 17 days when they land in Boston. The team left May 23 for a road trip that included stops in Denver and San Francisco before the London trip. ""So now going back what we're trying to do is if you want to sleep, sleep early in the flight, maybe for an hour or hour and a half, then get up and stay awake until we get there,"" Thomson said. NEW CRICKET FAN MLB is here to expand its fan base, but another ball-and-bat game has picked up some fans, too. ""I watched a lot of cricket while I was here. It was on TV the whole time,"" McNeil said. ""My wife got into it, I got into it. I think I'd be a heck of a cricket player. Being able to put it in play and hit it anywhere, I think that would be a lot of fun."" The TV coverage was of the cricket T20 World Cup being co-costed by the United States and West Indies. India was playing Pakistan in Westbury, New York, on Sunday. The United States scored a major upset over Pakistan on Thursday. ""I was going to try to see a match,"" McNeil said. ""I have no idea about the rules. I'd love to learn more, but it was pretty exciting to watch. I would love to try it. Hitting looks fun. You can hit it far and anywhere you want.""

7,Bob Pockrass,NASCAR takeaways: Kyle Larson caps week of uncertainty with Sonoma win,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/kyle-larson-caps-week-uncertainty-sonoma-win,Kyle Larson's title hopes got a rebirth when NASCAR granted him a waiver to stay playoff eligible. He followed it up by winning at Sonoma.,2024-06-10T01:12:50Z,"SONOMA, Calif. — Kyle Larson went from not being in the NASCAR playoffs to now being in position to be the favorite and points leader when they begin in 11 weeks. Larson's championship hopes got a rebirth Tuesday when NASCAR granted a waiver for him to remain playoff eligible despite not starting every race after he missed the Charlotte race on Memorial Day weekend when he was competing in the rain-delayed Indianapolis 500. Five days after receiving the waiver news, he won the NASCAR Cup Series race Sunday at Sonoma Raceway and retook the series points lead in the process. ""My mind never wavered,"" Larson said knowing he was using a pun. ""It was always kind of focused on executing and winning the regular season points, whether that be on the owner's side or whatever. My mindset has not changed at all. ""I race to win every single race, so yeah, I haven't really thought any differently since missing Charlotte."" The Hendrick driver earned his third win of the season and now has more playoff points — points that can help a driver advance in the playoffs if they don't win in a round — than any other Cup driver. The regular-season champion gets more playoff points (15) than any other driver, another reason it was important for Larson to take a 14-point lead in the regular-season standings. ""I thought [after Charlotte] we would still have a great shot to win the regular season title, which there's still a lot of racing left to be had,"" Larson said. ""I could easily have a couple [races I don't finish] here coming up."" Hendrick vice chairman Jeff Gordon said he didn't see much of a difference in the team's attitude from before to after the waiver decision. ""[The team] seemed to be business as usual and prepping for the next race, the next two races, the way they normally do,"" Gordon said about the St. Louis event that followed Charlotte before NASCAR determined a decision on the waiver and then the Sonoma prep. ""The best medicine in any of those situations is getting back to the racetrack. Especially when they got here, home track for Kyle [from nearby Elk Grove], and I think a track that they enjoy racing at, and a lot of the competitors do."" Takeaways on a caution-filled, strategy-laden ay at Sonoma where Michael McDowell finished second, Chris Buescher third, Chase Elliott fourth and Ross Chastain fifth. Truex, Busch Run Out Of Fuel Larson was on a different strategy where he pitted after the second stage and then just had to make a quick pit stop for fuel under green in the final stage. Buescher, McDowell, Martin Truex Jr. and Kyle Busch used a strategy where they stayed out at the end of the second stage for track position but had to have a longer pit stop for fuel under green in the final stage. That led to Larson having to run down those drivers for the win, passing Truex on Lap 102 of the 110-lap race. It also led to Truex to run out of gas when running second and Busch to run out of gas as he was turned by Chastain on the final lap. Busch finished 12th because he was able to nurse his car to the finish line, while Truex was 27th. More Frustrated Drivers Several drivers saw their races end early after accidents or mechanical issues. Ty Gibbs was the one driver who had an incident with the new Turn 11 inside wall put in for this race. ""I was finding grip down there and was making up time, and then got too close and clipped the wall and hurt the right front,"" Gibbs said. ""I just made a mistake and took us out."" Austin Dillon was a victim of a wreck where Erik Jones got into Josh Berry and pushed Berry into traffic in Turn 11. ""The 4 [of Berry] and the 43 [of Jones], I don't know what that is — [Berry] struggled all weekend,"" Dillon said. ""We broke the suspension in the right rear when we took the hit."" Larson Best On Attack Larson's ability to race without worrying about fuel mileage gave him the ability to be aggressive, which is where he is at his best. He was thoroughly confused over the strategy and didn't realize he would have to pass several drivers after his final pit stop. ""I thought, ‘Oh, my God, I'm like 10th,'"" Larson said about coming out of the points and then trying to run people down. ""I thought I was going to be faster for eight, 10 laps, but I didn't know once the tires came up to temp if they would equal out at some point because there were still 20-something laps left. ""It did, it definitely got closer to equaling out, but I still just had enough."" Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

Soto is being treated for left forearm inflammation. He missed the opening two games of the weekend, both won by the Dodgers, 2-1 in 11 innings on Friday and 11-3 on Saturday. New York had scored only four runs in 23 innings at the plate since Soto left Thursday night's 8-5 win over Minnesota. Three have come on two solo homers Saturday by Aaron Judge and his RBI single in the 11th inning of the opener. In losing the first two games to the Dodgers, the Yankees hit .200 (15 for 75), including .067 (1 for 15) with runners in scoring position. Soto is hitting .318 with 17 home runs, 53 RBIs and a 1.027 OPS. The 25-year-old outfielder, acquired in December from San Diego, can become a free agent after the World Series.

9,,Kylian Mbappé plays 20 minutes in France's final Euros warmup,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/kylian-mbappe-plays-20-minutes-france-final-euros-warmup,"Kylian Mbappé got some rest ahead of the European Championship, playing only about 20 minutes as France drew 0-0 with Canada on Sunday.",2024-06-09T23:16:29Z,"Kylian Mbappé got some rest ahead of the European Championship, playing only about 20 minutes as France drew 0-0 with Canada on Sunday in its final warmup. The match in Bordeaux marked Olivier Giroud's last home game for France. The striker, who is moving to Los Angeles FC in Major League Soccer, is retiring from the French national team after Euro 2024, which starts Friday in Germany. Mbappé entered in the 74th minute and failed to spark France to victory. He had played the entire friendly against Luxembourg on Wednesday, when he scored in France's 3-0 win in what was his first match since his move from Paris Saint-Germain to Real Madrid was finally confirmed. France's opening game at Euro 2024 is on June 17 against Austria. Mbappé reportedly was not fully fit after the game against Luxembourg and had missed some training sessions during the week but is expected to play a key role for France in Germany. France, runner-up to Argentina in the 2022 World Cup, is in Group D along with Poland and the Netherlands. Defending European champion Italy beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 1-0 at home. Davide Frattesi scored the only goal with a neat volley from inside the area in the 38th minute in Empoli. Italy won Euro 2020 but missed out on qualifying for the last two World Cups. It begins its Euro 2024 campaign on Saturday against Albania. The other teams in Group B are Spain and Croatia. Spain routed Northern Ireland 5-1 on Saturday, while Croatia defeated Portugal 2-1. Also Sunday, Slovakia routed Wales 4-0 with goals from Juraj Kucka, Robert Bozenik and Laszlo Benes, as well as an own-goal by Ethan Ampadu, intensifying the pressure on Wales manager Rob Page. Slovakia will start its Euro 2024 campaign on June 17 against Belgium. Group E's other teams are Romania and Ukraine. Reporting by the Associated Press.

10,Greg Auman,Bucs rookie receiver Kameron Johnson attempting jump from Div. II to NFL,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/bucs-rookie-receiver-kameron-johnson-attempting-jump-from-div-ii-nfl,"The undrafted Johnson is the first player from tiny Barton College in North Carolina to sign with an NFL team. ""I belong,"" he said.",2024-06-10T13:16:29Z,"Kameron Johnson has only had about six weeks and a dozen or so practices with the Bucs, but the undrafted rookie receiver's favorite moments are when he makes a catch or a move in the open field and someone walks up a minute later. ""People start asking: 'Where are you from? Where'd you go to school at?'"" Johnson said. ""They know nothing about Barton. A lot of people don't know about Barton."" To answer the basic questions, as Johnson does proudly: Barton College is in Wilson, N.C., and its nickname is the Bulldogs. They play in Division II, and Johnson was part of their first football team when the program relaunched in 2020, actually playing their first four games in spring 2021 due to COVID-19. Barton had last played football in 1950, when it was Atlantic Christian College, and on the first play of the reboot, Johnson lined up at receiver, got the ball on a reverse and threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to his quarterback. Now, after 51 catches for 875 yards and 7 TDs last season, he's the first Barton player to sign with an NFL team. ""It's definitely like a dream come true,"" he said, sitting in the Bucs' cafeteria after a morning practice last week. ""Just watching greats like Mike [Evans] and Chris [Godwin], trying to be a sponge as much as I can. Being out there on the practice field, I see I belong at this level, because I can definitely compete with everybody out there."" Undrafted rookies are generally long shots to stick on an NFL roster, and of the 90 players on the Bucs' roster, Johnson might seem the most unlikely on paper. He's the only one sharing a jersey number with another player, as both he and former first-round draft pick Joe Tryon-Shoyinka are wearing No. 9 right now. If Johnson were to make it through final cuts, he'd get a new number. Go back four years, and he was graduating high school in Rocky Mount, N.C., as a 5-foot-6, 140-pound quarterback. At that size, he had no Division I offers and just a few nearby Division III and NAIA offers. Instead, he chose to be part of the first team at Barton. That first game had an announced attendance of 240 people; his final game last fall had 207 on the road. Barton's home stadium seats 3,500 fans, and in a few months, Johnson could be playing in front of 60,000. ""It's been surreal,"" he said. ""Coming from Division II, I'm like the bottom of the barrel. Being here is a culture shock — everything, locker room, equipment, this cafeteria, just everything."" Johnson has grown considerably in the past four years, so he was measured at 5-foot-8, 185 pounds before the draft and says he's now 190. He ran the 40 in 4.46 seconds, posted a 37-inch vertical jump, and in a short time, he's made a strong first impression on his coaches since coming to Tampa. ""Extremely athletic,"" coach Todd Bowles said last week. ""He can catch and get upfield in a heartbeat. He's a very good pattern runner and has very good hands. It'll be nice to see him in pads."" That the Bucs found Johnson speaks to the depth of their commitment to scouting and leaving no stone unturned. Their area scout, Brian McLaughlin, spent time on Barton's campus last fall, watching a practice. The school didn't have much tape available, but McLaughlin got access to the team's HUDL account to get more game footage to evaluate. It's common for small-school prospects to participate in the pro day of a larger school nearby, and when Johnson worked out in Raleigh at NC State's pro day, Tony Hardie, Tampa's assistant director of college scouting, was on hand as well. ""It's a testament to what these guys do and how much they dig,"" Bucs director of player personnel Mike Biehl said. ""If they're out there, we'll find them."" Johnson averaged 17.24 yards per catch last season for Barton. (Photo courtesy of Barton College)  Back at Barton, they're thrilled to have a player on an NFL roster, another step in a program's growth. Chip Hester, the head coach since the program started up again, wears a ""BC"" polo everywhere he goes, but said once he gets west of Greensboro, people think it's Brevard College, another small school. In addition to Johnson, Barton had a second Bulldog in an NFL camp this offseason. Running back Jordan Terrell attended rookie minicamp with the Titans as a tryout player before signing with the CFL's BC Lions in mid-May. ""This is a big deal for us,"" said Hester. ""We've got a great place here, a great community. One of the things I love so much about he and Jordan getting the opportunities they're getting is they're two of our best workers. For the rest of the team, you say, 'Hey look, this is how you work, and this is what might happen if you work this way.' It's been fun to watch."" Barton's program was new enough that it had just two coaches on the recruiting trail when they spotted Johnson, noting how he played with confidence in football and basketball despite being surrounded by bigger athletes. ""He made plays. He was just undersized,"" Hester said. ""You saw the potential there, and at that time, we wanted to get as many quarterbacks as we could. In high school, when you're trying to find your best leader and your best athlete, you put him at quarterback. We knew he'd be an impact player, and he worked himself into being a great player."" Hester was at North Carolina A&T before he took the Barton job, and one of his players there was running back Tarik Cohen, who played four years with the Bears and made a Pro Bowl despite being only 5-foot-6 and 180 pounds. Hester has seen smaller players from smaller schools make it all the way to NFL stardom before, and he hopes for more of the same with Johnson. ""I thought if someone gives him the chance, he's going to make a good impression,"" Hester said. ""I told all the scouts that came through, 'If you like what you see on film, you're going to love him as a kid.' Coaches are going to love him and teammates are going to respect him, because of the way he works. I'm not surprised, but very pleased, that he has this opportunity."" Johnson got bigger, but he also made himself smarter, a self-described ""football nerd"" hitting film to learn opponents' tendencies, processing the game on a much more detailed level and loving that aspect of game prep. Johnson could have returned to school for a fifth season because of the COVID year but chose to go pro. The Athletic's Dane Brugler had him ranked as the No. 63 receiver in the draft, and only 35 were selected, but the Bucs knew who he was and jumped on him after the draft. Johnson had heard from the Jets, Texans and Saints, but Tampa Bay was able to sign him after the draft with a $10,000 signing bonus — an extremely small investment by NFL standards — and now he'll compete for a roster spot. ""He's exceeded expectations,"" Biehl said. ""You don't really know a whole lot about him coming in. Every time we get through a free-agent class, the guys I haven't seen, I'll throw tape on. We had two games in our system, so I really couldn't watch a lot after the fact. Everything we saw was out here for the first time."" [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox? Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.] A small-school gem like Johnson is rare, and will be increasingly hard to find. The advent of NIL payments and the transfer portal means that bigger schools are identifying talent at lower levels and targeting them, making it less likely an NFL-level prospect like Johnson stays with a smaller program for his entire college career. The Bucs' top four receivers are pretty set, but Johnson is now part of a wide-open competition going into training camp, with nine other receivers, mostly young and inexperienced, battling for the last two or three jobs.  ""It's definitely exciting,"" he said. ""But I'm focused, tunnel-visioned on this playbook. You can't take any day for granted. You have to take advantage of your opportunities, show them what you can do to help this team.""

11,,NBA Finals predictions: Can Jayson Tatum leads Celtics to glory?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/nba-finals-predictions-can-jayson-tatum-leads-celtics-glory,FOX Sports' panel of NBA reporters make their predictions for the 2024 NBA Finals.,2024-06-07T00:01:13Z,"The 2024 NBA Finals tip-off on Thursday with the Boston Celtics hosting the Dallas Mavericks at TD Garden for Game 1. Ahead of the star-studded series, we asked FOX Sports' panel of NBA reporters — Ric Bucher, Melissa Rohlin and Yaron Weitzman — to make their predictions for the Finals winner and MVP. Here's what they had to say: 1. Make your case for the Dallas Mavericks winning the NBA Finals Yaron: They have the best player in the series in Luka Doncic. Not only is he the best player, but he's a star for whom there's no defense. Add in the way Kyrie Irving is playing, plus the Mavs' newfound stud defense, and you have an obvious recipe for a title.  Melissa:  Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have really found their rhythm together. They're fearless in crunch time. And they have an outstanding defensive presence alongside them. Doncic is hungry for his first championship and Irving knows what it takes to win one after winning a title with Cleveland in 2016 alongside LeBron James.. If I were a betting person, there's no team I'd trust more with the game on the line.  Ric: As one anonymous GM said to me recently, ""They're either the best team in basketball or on an epic heater."" Either way, they come in with a ton of momentum. I also like the way they match up defensively against the Celtics — Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington are fully capable of guarding Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and the Daniel Gafford/Dereck Lively II combo is athletic enough to stay with Kristaps Porzingis. The Mavs' offense, having just had its way with the Timberwolves' No. 1 defense, needs no explanation. 2. Make your case for the Boston Celtics winning the NBA Finals Yaron: They've been the best team all season, and it wasn't even close. They outscored opponents by 11.7 points per 100 possessions, the fifth-best scoring margin of all time and the difference between their point differential and that of the No. 2 ranked Denver Nuggets was nearly equal to the difference between the Nuggets and the No. 20 ranked Chicago Bulls. This is a dominant squad loaded with elite two-way talent. Melissa: Aside from them being the top-rated offense and the second-rated defense this season, they undoubtedly have the ""want"" factor. After reaching the 2022 Finals and then falling to the Golden State Warriors, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are hungry to finish what they failed to accomplish two years ago. They know how hard it is to reach the Finals, after losing to Miami in seven games in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals. And now that they're back here again, they're not going to want to squander this opportunity. Ric: Despite all their dominance, they're still being doubted, which should be a powerful motivator. That they rolled through the playoffs despite missing Porzingis says a lot about how Brown, Tatum, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday meshed and were able to compensate for his absence. 3. If the Mavericks win the NBA Finals, who is going to win Finals MVP? Yaron: I guess Kyrie has a shot, but if the Mavericks win, it's going to be because of Luca. They'll go as far as he takes them.  Melissa: Luka Doncic. He has been the team's motor and I expect him to pour his heart out in these Finals.  Ric: The voters, who are asked to fill out their ballots in the final minutes of the closeout game, invariably go with the player who has the gaudiest statistics and that is almost certain to be Luka. But what if Kyrie goes nuclear in the fourth quarter of the final game to win it? That's a possibility and that's probably what it would take for him to beat out Luka.  4. If the Celtics win the NBA Finals, who is going to be Finals MVP? Yaron: This is more interesting. Obviously, Jayson Tatum would be the favorite, followed closely by Jaylen Brown. But don't sleep on Derrick White, either. He's been great all season.  Melissa: Jayson Tatum. If the Celtics win this, Tatum will have to play his best basketball.  Ric: Having seen Andre Iguodala get it for the Warriors for, in part, his work defending LeBron James, there's a world in which Jrue Holiday or whoever guards Luka has a shot at it. But I don't see Boston winning the series unless Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are what they've been to date in the playoffs — and that's with Brown showing the form that earned him the Eastern Conference finals MVP award. So I'd put my money on Brown.  5. Who do you think is going to win the NBA Finals and why? Yaron: Mavericks in 7. I've been having a lot of trouble with this one, and I genuinely believe it's a toss up. To me, however, Luka is too good to pick against. The Celtics might have the depth and a roster built to make him work. But I don't think there's any stopping him, especially not when he's playing in an ecosystem tailored to accentuating his strengths. The Mavericks have everything — an elite secondary scorer and playmaker. Three-point shooters. Dangerous rim-runners and lob-catchers. Having Luka surrounded by all that just feels unfair. Melissa: Mavericks in 6. After watching this team's confidence and the way it handled pressure against the Minnesota Timberwolves, it's hard for me to imagine this team losing right now. Luka and Kyrie alternate picking up the slack if one of them is struggling offensively. They're both unflappable in the biggest of moments. The Mavericks' defense is elite. They're clicking on all cylinders at the perfect time, peaking late season and into the playoffs. This team is going to be tough to beat.  Ric: How I wish I could answer this after the first game, because the return of Kristaps Porzingis is a major wrinkle in my belief in the Mavs. I will stick with the Mavs in six, under the assumption that the month off is going to have an impact on Porzingis the same way it did on Joel Embiid. And I still have trouble believing the Celtics offensively aren't in for a rude awakening against this much-improved Dallas defense. The net playoff ratings for the teams Boston and Dallas had to go through are starkly different. The Celtics played the sixth, 12th and 16th-rated teams. The Mavs beat the second, fourth and 13th.

12,Martin Rogers,Gareth Southgate bucks the trend with 'brutal' final England cuts,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/gareth-southgate-bucks-trend-brutal-final-england-cuts,"Gareth Southgate named his 26-man Euro 2024 squad, but did it differently to most.",2024-06-07T00:12:38Z,"England head coach Gareth Southgate knew he had to wield the ax sooner or later — and ultimately did it a day before the European Championships squad deadline. Southgate revealed his 26-man roster on Thursday at the end of a grueling round of tough decisions, because that's what you get when you have a group of players stacked with international-level talent. England is the betting favorite to win Euro 2024, and Southgate's task was more difficult than most of his coaching contemporaries because of the sheer number of options at his disposal.  After the omission of Tottenham midfielder James Maddison was leaked a day earlier, Jack Grealish and Harry Maguire were the other big names to be told they won't be heading to Germany this summer. How each of the 32 head coaches tackled the job of finalizing their squad ahead of next week's start to the tournament says a lot about their personal approach, and also the nature of the list of players available to them. Southgate made a first cut to 33 names two weeks ago, with the headline disappointment belonging to Marcus Rashford, who played in the final three years ago but struggled for Manchester United last season. ""All of the players took the news really respectfully,"" Southgate told reporters. ""Al players believe they should be in. We just feel other players have had stronger seasons, particularly in the last six months or so."" The remaining group had been training together, although Jude Bellingham was a late arrival, having been given a few days off after winning the Champions League with Real Madrid. Maddison was a key part of things during qualifying, but had hit a stretch of disappointing form at club level. Grealish was a casualty because Southgate is over-subscribed with attacking options, while Maguire has been unable to hit full fitness. James Trafford, Curtis Jones, Jarrad Branthwaite and Jarell Quansah were the other sent home, mostly as expected. However, the plight of players missing out through final cuts is one of the most brutal things in soccer. National teams get together at isolated training camps, and seek to come together quickly as a group. To suddenly be forced to leave such an environment before the tournament begins and miss out on one of the greatest events in the sport, is gut wrenching. The inevitable emotions that go along with that is part of the reason why so many coaches elect to name their group early. That's what Hungary did, and. Denmark, Serbia, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Czechia and Georgia, plus Portugal, whose coach Roberto Martinez naturally included superstar Cristiano Ronaldo – now aged 39. Croatia named its squad but put an additional nine players on standby, told to remain in shape and ready if any injuries. Ukraine did the same, but with six backups. World Cup finalists France did not use their full allocation, Didier Deschamps going with 25 players just like he did in Qatar. Belgium took the same approach. A small group, including both Germany and its opening game rival Scotland named 27 early, with the final cut most likely to be the fourth goalkeeper. Others left some final decisions until late. Reigning champ Italy's Luciano Spalletti also pared the squad down to 26 on Thursday, leaving out Riccardo Orsolini, Samuele Ricci and Ivan Provedel. The outliers were Switzerland and Turkey, still with 38 and 34 men in camp respectively as the cutoff neared, although part of that process was about trying to give experience and exposure to younger players who knew they had little chance of making the final number. Whatever method used, that particular type of headache can at least now be put aside for the coaches. Before, of course, another bunch of them arrive – who to start, what formation to use, and how, ultimately, to try to win the tournament. Martin Rogers is a columnist for FOX Sports.

13,Eric Williams,"UFL playoffs: What to watch for in Panthers-Stallions, Brahmas-Battlehawks",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/ufl/ufl-playoffs-what-watch-panthers-stallions-brahmas-battlehawks,The USFL and XFL Conference champions will meet in the inaugural UFL title game on June 16. Here’s a look at the two matchups.,2024-06-07T20:15:20Z,"In a teaser for the inaugural UFL playoffs, the St. Louis Battlehawks hosted the San Antonio Brahmas and the Michigan Panthers visited the Birmingham Stallions in the final week of the 2024 regular season. Both closely contested games were decided by one point, with missed field goals in the final seconds being the difference. This weekend's games are also expected to come down to the wire, as the Battlehawks (7-3) take on the Brahmas (7-3) on Sunday (7 p.m. ET on FOX and the FOX Sports app) for the XFL Conference title and a spot in the UFL Championship Game on June 16. The Battlehawks, who have home-field advantage, are currently the favorite over San Antonio. The USFL Conference Championship Game between the Stallions (9-1) and the Panthers (7-3) takes place Saturday (3 p.m. ET), with Birmingham as the favorite. ""There aren’t going to be any freebies,"" Stallions head coach Skip Holtz said about championship weekend. ""You’re going to have to make a play. It’s not going to be, ‘Oh I’m running wide open, throw it to me.’ That isn’t going to happen. This is playoff football. You’re going to have to make some contested catches and … some plays against the defense."" Here’s a closer look at what to watch for in these playoffs. USFL title game breakdown Birmingham is vying for the team’s third consecutive championship title, but Holtz understands that Saturday’s contest will not be easy — even though he’s 30-4 over the past three seasons. The Stallions are 5-0 at home this season, winning by an average margin of seven points per contest, but they face a Michigan squad that had been riding a five-game winning streak before last week’s 20-19 loss. ""They’ve both been one-possession games, and they’ve gone right down to the end,"" Holtz said of Birmingham's previous matchups against Michigan. ""I think it’s going to be another nail-biter. You get into these playoff games … when you talk about Michigan, San Antonio and St. Louis … every one of those games were one-possession games. ""The difference in this new league can come down to this extra point … a two-point play or a one-point play. I think every one of them that you take during the course of a game is a huge win if you can find a way to put points on the board."" During the regular season, teams converted 47.8% of the time for one point, 40.7% of the time for two points and just 22.2% of the time when going for three points. The Stallions were 5 of 8 (62.5%) on one-point tries and 9 of 23 (39.1%) on two-point attempts. They didn't try a three-point attempt during the regular season.  On the other hand, the Panthers finished 9 of 16 (56.3%) on one-point conversions, 3 of 9 (33.3%) on two-point attempts and 0 of 1 on three-point tries. How these two teams execute on extra points in a close game could decide this one. Season series The Stallions won both games they played against the Panthers during the regular season, but they were both close. Birmingham defeated Michigan at Ford Field in Week 2, 20-13, and in their regular-season finale at Protective Stadium. What's more, the Stallions have never lost to the Panthers, going 4-0 over the past three years dating back to the USFL. Key matchup: Stallions QB Adrian Martinez vs. Panthers defensive UFL MVP frontrunner Martinez led the league in rushing yards (528) during the regular season. He also finished tied for second in passing touchdowns (15) and third in passing yards (1,750). However, the Panthers limited their explosive plays in last week’s narrow loss, holding Martinez to 204 scrimmage yards and one touchdown pass. Things got a little chippy last week, as a couple of players had to be separated at the end of the game while leaving the field. ""It’s nice to see when it means a lot to them,"" Nolan said. ""I enjoy that part."" It will take another strong effort from Panthers head coach Mike Nolan’s defense. The longtime NFL defensive coordinator won the inaugural UFL Coach of the Year honors, turning around a team that finished 4-7 in the USFL last season. Quarterback Danny Etling will get the start for the Panthers, who have used four different quarterbacks this season, on Saturday. Michigan’s dual-threat signal-caller Bryce Perkins suffered a leg injury while trying to hurdle a Birmingham defender last week and was subsequently placed on IR.  Key stats The Panthers anticipate running back Matthew Colburn returning to the starting lineup after missing Week 10. However, Wes Hills (leg) remains out for the season, meaning Michigan will lean heavily on Colburn and fellow RB Nate McCrary. Michigan averaged 125 rushing yards per game during the regular season, second in the league behind Birmingham (134 yards). The Panthers also allowed just 78 rushing yards per game defensively during the season, second in the UFL. The return of safeties Kai Nacua and Corrion Ballard should help the Panthers defensively. Top receiver Marcus Simms also is expected to play after missing last week’s game with a hamstring issue. The Stallions finished the regular season tied for the league lead in takeaways with 15, creating extra possessions for the most explosive offense in the league. Meanwhile, the Panthers turned it over 10 times this season. Newly minted All-UFL tight end Jace Sternberger finished with two receptions for 53 yards and a score on three targets. Holtz would like to get him more involved in the offense. RB Ricky Person returns for Birmingham after sitting out Week 10. XFL title game breakdown St. Louis will host its first professional football playoff games since the St. Louis Rams were there in 2004, and a charged-up crowd is expected at The Dome at America’s Center on Sunday. The Battlehawks have averaged over 34,000 fans a contest at their home games, easily the most in the UFL. Head coach Anthony Becht said that his team didn’t hold back last week, assuring home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with a close win over San Antonio, but he expects another tight game this weekend. ""We were in it to win it,"" Becht said of Week 10's matchup. ""We were all in, everything was pressed forward. We’ve got nine weeks of film. They’ve got nine weeks of film. There [are] no secrets in this thing."" Season series The Battlehawks swept the season series, defeating the Brahmas in San Antonio in Week 3, 31-24, and escaping with a 13-12 win in the final game of the regular season. St. Louis is 3-0 against San Antonio dating back to the XFL last season.  However, Brahmas breakout receiver Jontre Kirklin believes that Sunday’s game is all that matters. ""Regroup, perfect the finer details at practice and come back out swinging again next week,"" he said. ""We got another big game, so we’ve got to come out and dominate. We can’t dwell on this loss. We’ve got to move on."" Key matchup: Battlehawks RB Jacob Saylors vs. Brahmas defense  Saylors led St. Louis with 461 rushing yards and eight total touchdowns during the regular season, but San Antonio bottled up Saylors last week, holding him to just 57 scrimmage yards and no touchdowns on 14 touches. The Brahmas, who managed just 56 rushing yards last week, should get a boost with John Lovett (chest) expected to return from an injury that kept him out last week. RB Anthony McFarland (shoulder) remains a question mark for Sunday. Another key for San Antonio’s offense will be if QB Chase Garbers can return to the field this week. The Cal product reaggravated a wrist injury that forced him to miss five games this season. He was a limited participant in practice this week. If Garbers can’t go, backup Quinten Dormady will get the start. Key stats  San Antonio head coach Wade Phillips has done a nice job of creating consistent pressure up front. The Brahmas lead the league with 32.0 sacks and have held teams to a league-low 14.7 points per game. St. Louis kicker Andre Szmyt has been a consistent performer all season, finishing 19 of 21 (90.5%) on field goals with a long of 61 yards. He has made 12 straight field goals dating back to Week 4 of the regular season.  Becht said it was important for QB AJ McCarron to get back on the field and shake the rust off before the playoffs. McCarron missed two games with an ankle injury but has been one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the UFL this year. In two seasons with St. Louis, McCarron boasts a 12-5 record, completing 66.7% of his passes for 3,732 passing yards, with 39 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.  Something to watch: Brecht recently expressed frustration that San Antonio safety Teez Tabor appeared to be targeting McCarron’s ankle last week.

14,,England loses to Iceland in friendly before Euro 2024; Germany tops Greece,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/england-loses-iceland-friendly-before-euro-2024-germany-tops-greece,England was booed by some of its fans after losing 1-0 to Iceland on Friday in its last friendly before the European Championship.,2024-06-07T22:34:41Z,"England was booed by some of its own fans after losing 1-0 to Iceland on Friday in its last friendly before the European Championship, while host nation Germany recovered from a goal down to beat Greece, 2-1. Jón Dagur Thorsteinsson left defender John Stones standing as he scored for Iceland in the 16th minute to bring back memories of one of England's lowest points of recent years, its 2-1 elimination by Iceland at Euro 2016. Germany needed substitute Pascal Gross' 89th-minute goal to secure the win over Greece a week before it opens Euro 2024 against Scotland in Munich. Georgios Masouras gave Greece the lead in the 34th on the rebound after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer failed to hold a shot from Christos Tzolis. Arsenal forward Kai Havertz leveled in the 56th when he shot on the turn, and it went in off Manolis Siopis. After Benjamin Henrichs sent a shot off the bar in the 83rd, Germany finally took the lead when Gross hit a fierce shot from outside the box. Neuer's error came shortly after Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann confirmed he was cutting Stuttgart goalkeeper Alexander Nübel as he finalized the 26-player squad for the tournament. Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Hoffenheim's Oliver Baumann are the two other goalkeepers in the squad. [Check out our Euro 2024 preview] Elsewhere Friday, Poland beat neighbor Ukraine, 3-1, and Scotland drew 2-2 with Finland. Romania failed to beat one of Europe's smallest nations, Liechtenstein, in a 0-0 draw. The Czech Republic cruised to a 7-1 win over Malta. Albania beat Azerbaijan, 3-1.

15,Jason McIntyre,"2024 NBA Mock Draft 2.0: Alex Sarr falls to No. 3, Zach Edey taken in top-10",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/2024-nba-mock-draft-2-0-alex-sarr-falls-no-3-zach-edey-taken-top-10,The 2024 NBA Draft is less than a month away and there's a new No. 1 in FOX Sports' mock draft.,2024-06-07T18:56:48Z,"The 2024 NBA Draft is less than a month away and there's a new No. 1 in FOX Sports' mock draft. Let's take a look at where things stand now before the withdrawal deadline on June 16: 1 Atlanta Hawks - Zaccharie Risacher, F, JL Bourg (LNB) The French teenager looks like the prototypical NBA wing who can guard multiple positions and splash 3-pointers. His frame is reminiscent of Kevin Durant's, and it could be a few years before he pops — like Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee. Risacher's range is anywhere from 1-10, which is unprecedented to say at the top of a draft. 2 Washington Wizards - Donovan Clingan, C, UConn I don't think he's the 2nd best player in the draft, but I can see him having a Dereck Lively-type impact. The Wizards don't have many good players, and defensively were 28th last year. 3 Houston Rockets (via Brooklyn) - Alex Sarr, F/C, Perth Wildcats (NBL) Tough spot for the Rockets, who have their center of the future (Sengun) and young talent all over the roster. They could use an impact veteran to push them into the playoffs. Sell high on Sengun? Trade the pick? Draft and develop? There are many options. 4 San Antonio Spurs - Rob Dillingham, PG, Kentucky There's a world where he goes 1st overall, mostly since he's probably the best pure scorer in this draft. He's Kyrie Irving's size. Only 19, he shot 44 percent on 3-pointers as a freshman. 5 Detroit Pistons - Stephon Castle, G, UConn Could be the best player from this draft five years from now, I believe that much in his skillset. If he adds a reliable 3-pointer, we're looking at an All-Star. 6 Charlotte Hornets - Reed Sheppard, G, Kentucky The Hornets should not draft for fit, because it seems like the only lock to be on the team in three years is Brandon Miller. Draft the best guy and figure the rest out. Nick Smith, taken 27th last year, played well in 51 games but shooting was an issue. Sheppard led college hoops shooting 52 percent from deep.  7 Portland Trail Blazers - Matas Buzelis, F, G League Ignite Another wing with a European background who is tall, moves well, and can shoot. The Chandler Parsons comparisons are very obvious. If he pops as a rookie, they could send Jerami Grant and his good contract to a needy contender. 8 San Antonio Spurs (via Toronto) - Tidjane Salaun, Wing, France Assuming the Spurs don't package their two picks for an impact player (Darius Garland?), I like getting another French teenager who can play multiple positions. An 18-year old who grows alongside Wembanyama. 9 Memphis Grizzlies - Zach Edey, C, Purdue I don't love Edey as a prospect, and he doesn't project as a starter, but in a conference with Wemby, Jokic, AD and Sabonis, why not get a defensive presence? The Grizzlies were a 50+ win team two years ago; they're a couple role players - and health luck - away from getting back there. 10 Utah Jazz - Nikola Topic, PG, Crvena Zvezda His recent ACL injury - and two other injuries this season - probably pushes him out of the Top 5, but Utah could be a good fit as they have cycled through point guards the last few years  11 Chicago Bulls - Devin Carter, G, Providence Topped all Combine participants with a 35-inch no-step vertical, and his combination of speed and length have made him a hot prospect who could have an instant impact, especially if they part with Zach LaVine or lose DeMar DeRozan. 12 Oklahoma City Thunder (via Houston) - Cody Williams, F, Colorado Another trade candidate, because they have so much young talent and are a player or two away from being a contender. If OKC looks to package some of their wings and picks for an All-Star talent, Williams and his 7-foot-1 wingspan makes a lot of sense because in a year or two, he could be a strong rotational player. 13 Sacramento Kings - Ron Holland, SF, G League Ignite If the Kings lose Malik Monk next month, they'll need an off-the-bench scorer to provide pop and that might be Holland. Only 18, he wasn't an efficient scorer last season, but there's a Russell Westbrook element to how hard he plays. 14 Portland Trail Blazers - Kel'el Ware, C, Indiana The draft is less about what players were in college, but rather what they can be in the pros. With DeAndre Ayton only having two more guaranteed years, at which point they can transition to Ware. Or perhaps earlier, if Ware makes the leap and Ayton's expiring contract is attractive trade bait. 15 Miami Heat - Dalton Knecht, F, Tennessee A top 10 talent, but he is 23 years old and the history of players that age going in the lottery (bad teams!) is littered with failures. The Heat hit a home run with Jaime Jacquez; they do the same with offensive-minded Knecht. 16 Philadelphia 76ers - Jared McCain, G, Duke It's unclear if he's a point guard, a combo, or an undersized shooting guard, but this much we know: He's a scorer and a fantastic shooter. In the final 12 games, he topped 30 points three times. 17 Los Angeles Lakers - DaRon Holmes, F, Dayton Once talked about as a lottery pick, Holmes finally put it all together for an outstanding junior season while showing flashes of a 3-pointer (shot 38 percent on 2.5 attempts per game). Great athlete, terrific shot blocker, turns 22 in August. 18 Orlando Magic - Kyshawn George, G/F, Miami The Magic's lack of 3-point shooting was exposed in the playoff series loss to Cleveland. George shot 40 percent from deep last year in Miami. Only 19, he can play the 2/3 at 6-foot-8. 19 Toronto Raptors (via Indiana) - Johnny Furphy, F, Kansas He's the prototypical NBA wing - long, athletic, can defend multiple positions. Built in the mold of two wings they've lost - Siakam and Anunoby. 20 Cleveland Cavaliers - Carlton Carrington, SG, Pittsburgh If Darius Garland is indeed shipped, they're going to need to start building up bench depth at guard. Still a teenager, Carrington showed flashes of being a scoring guard as his freshman season went on, hand ended it with a 24-point outing against UNC. 21 New Orleans Pelicans (via Milwaukee) - Tristan da Silva, F, Colorado Don't need to look hard to see the immediate future of the NBA - if you're in the 6-6 to 6-9 mold with a good wingspan, you have big-time value since you can defend multiple positions and space the floor. Only reason he's this low is that he's 23 years old. Hit 42 percent of his 3's. 22 Phoenix Suns - Kyle Filipowski, F/C, Duke A polarizing prospect because there are significant questions about his defense, which likely will keep him out of the lottery. He's talented, and in the right system, he can thrive off the bench as a high IQ small-ball center who can pass, shoot and attack the rim. 23 Milwaukee Bucks (via New Orleans) - Tyler Kolek, PG, Marquette You're telling me his work ethic and skill can't put him on a Jalen Brunson track? Remember, lefty Brunson was taken in the 2nd round and nobody saw All-NBA. It's unlikely Kolek gets all the way there, but in the right organization, he will thrive. 24 New York Knicks (via Dallas) - Isaiah Collier, G, USC If you buy that his team was terrible and the injuries slowed a hot start, he should be a Top 20 pick, maybe even the lottery. Reminds me of another bullish USC guard, Jordan McLaughlin, who has been a rotational player for the Wolves. 25 New York Knicks - Baylor Scheierman, Wing, Creighton Sharpshooter who shot over 80 percent from the line in his last four years, and may be the best 3-point shooter in the draft. Please give Jalen Brunson more catch and shoot snipers. 26 Washington Wizards - Trey Alexander, G, Creighton I'm higher on him than many, which probably means I watched too much Creighton this season. Was a Top 60 recruit. Bucket-getting and a solid creator who was wedged into a role and didn't really get to flash his total skill set. He's 21, and is talented enough to get into the rotation as a rookie. 27 Minnesota Timberwolves - Yves Missi, C, Baylor Just turned 20, and is definitely a project. Minnesota must draft someone here who can play in a year or two and help ease the financial burden in the front court. 28 Denver Nuggets - Ajay Mitchell, G, UCSB Smart scoring guard from Belgium who simply needs to add a reliable 3-point shot to become a starter in this league. Turns 22 right before the draft. 29  Utah Jazz - Ja'Kobe Walter, SG, Baylor There's been chatter about the 6-foot-4 Walter going in the back end of the lottery. Averaged 14.5 ppg as a freshman, but for a shooter, he only shot 34 percent from deep. Had trouble finishing in the restricted area (42 percent). 30 Boston Celtics - AJ Johnson, PG, Illawarra (NBL) A candidate to soar up mock drafts in the coming weeks, Johnson had a terrific combine and opened some eyes as a pesky defender and versatile guard despite extremely modest stats in limited playing time in the NBL.

16,,Chiefs' Rashee Rice said he'll 'mature' following alleged incidents,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/chiefs-rashee-rice-said-he-will-mature-following-alleged-incidents,"In his first comments since his arrest in April, Chiefs WR Rashee Rice said he's looking to ""move forward"" and ""mature.""",2024-06-10T14:42:15Z,"Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice is looking to ""move forward"" and ""mature"" following a rough offseason. Speaking with reporters at a youth football camp, Rice made his first comments since a pair of recent incidents, including his arrest in April for an alleged aggravated assault. He also was later a suspect for an alleged assault at a Dallas club. ""I've learned so much from that,"" Rice said of his alleged postseason incidents. ""All I can do is mature and continue to grow from that. This is a step in a better direction for me."" The arrest for the alleged aggravated assault stemmed from a high-speed, multi-car crash on an expressway in Dallas. Rice allegedly raced another vehicle and was driving his Lamborghini Urus as fast as 119 mph before hitting a retaining wall, with the two cars causing four other vehicles to be damaged. A video later obtained and shared by The Dallas Morning News showed five people from the Lamborghini and Chevrolet Corvette, the car Rice was allegedly racing, leaving the scene of the crash without checking on the victims. Two of the victims were transported to the hospital while two others dealt with minor injuries. Twelve days after the March 30 crash, Rice was charged with a count of aggravated assault, a count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injuries. He turned himself in a day later, on April 11, before posting bail.  Rice is also being sued for $10 million in punitive damages and $1 million in actual damages by a pair of the victims from the crash. In the $10 million lawsuit, the victims claim that they're dealing with several injuries, such as brain trauma, lacerations, contusions, internal bleeding and disfigurement. Less than a month after the arrest, Rice was under investigation for allegedly punching a photographer at a Dallas club. The victim opted not to press charges and Rice was not arrested or charged with a crime. Amid his alleged problems off the field, Rice has attended offseason workouts for the Chiefs. Rice said he's trying to become a better person in the wake of the alleged incidents, saying ""all you can do is move forward and walk around being the same person, try to be positive so that everybody can feel your love and your great energy,"" Rice had a standout rookie season for the Chiefs in 2023, recording 79 receptions for 938 yards and seven touchdowns in the regular season. He added 26 receptions for 262 yards and a touchdown in the postseason.  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league is monitoring Rice's situation ""closely"" but will ""allow the legal process to move through"" before handing out any discipline, he told ESPN in April. "
17,,"Giants, Cardinals to wear Negro Leagues throwbacks for MLB at Rickwood Field game",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/giants-cardinals-wear-negro-leagues-throwbacks-mlb-rickwood-field-game,MLB released a first look at the throwback jerseys the Giants and Cardinals will wear at the MLB at Rickwood Field game (June 20 on FOX).,2024-06-12T18:52:48Z,"The MLB at Rickwood Field game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals will be, in many different ways, a celebration of the Negro Leagues' integral place in baseball history. One of those tributes will be in the very uniforms the Giants and Cardinals will wear when they take the field at the iconic Birmingham, Alabama, venue on June 20. The uniforms, which MLB revealed on Wednesday, pay tribute to the Negro League teams that played in the cities the Giants and Cardinals now call home — the San Francisco Sea Lions and St. Louis Stars. In 1946, their only season as part of the Negro Leagues before becoming an independent barnstorming team, the Sea Lions donned a color scheme of orange and dark navy blue, similar to the Giants' current color palate.  The biggest difference between the two teams' uniforms is the large Sea Lion mascot logo on the front left torso, which bears a resemblance to some of the vintage Chicago Cubs bear logos from that era. The jerseys also have ""San Francisco"" in blue lettering on the chest with orange-and-blue piping down the front of the jersey. The navy blue hats also feature the logo in an orange outline. The Giants first wore throwbacks honoring the Sea Lions in a May 2014 game against the Atlanta Braves and have worn this particular throwback for a game annually each year since 2021 to honor San Francisco's African-American baseball heritage. The Cardinals have also worn Stars-themed throwbacks several times before, starting in 1997 and as recently as 2022. These gray throwback jerseys for the designated road team feature navy blue lettering and an inventive piping design that comes together to form a stylish necktie look down the front of the jersey. The ""St. Louis"" on the front is in navy blue block lettering with a red outline and the navy blue hats say ""StL"" going across in white font, a dramatic departure from the interlocking ""StL"" logo on the Cardinals' hats. After spending its first 13 years of existence as an independent team (called the St. Louis Giants at the time), the Stars joined the Negro Leagues in 1920 and became one of its greatest dynasties. The Stars won three Negro National League pennants in four seasons from 1928-1931 and developed a rivalry with the famed Kansas City Monarchs on the other side of Missouri. The Stars featured Negro League legends such as Cool Papa Bell, Mule Suttles, Willie Wells and John Henry Lloyd, all of whom are enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The game at Rickwood Field will take place at 7 p.m. ET on July 20 on FOX and the FOX Sports App. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

18,,Is 2024 poised to be Martin Truex Jr.'s last NASCAR Cup Series season?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/2024-nascar-cup-series-season-poised-martin-truex-jr-last,"If 2024 is indeed the final season for Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick wants to be able to properly celebrate the 2017 Cup Series champion.",2024-06-12T19:33:27Z,"It's been a rough June for Martin Truex Jr. Last week, he came in 27th at the Toyota/SaveMart 350, which came after finishing 34th at the Enjoy Illinois 300. Sticking with the former, though, Truex wasn't able to finish the race at Sonoma Speedway, as he ran out of gas on the home stretch of the final lap.  Over the past year, there has been discussion and rumors that the 2024 season will be Truex's last in the NASCAR Cup Series. On the latest edition of ""Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour,"" host Kevin Harvick pondered whether this season is indeed Truex's final one. ""This is a sport of just being committed at the highest level every day. It's not that Martin isn't committed to doing the things that he's doing, but the uncertainty just doesn't allow you to go through the processes of building on a daily basis, because you don't know what's next year,"" Harvick said. ""And eventually, it's bad for the team, and I think we're at a point where it's bad for the team. You're hearing a lot of rumors about Chase Briscoe going into that [No.] 19 car with everything happening at Stewart-Haas Racing.  ""Maybe they're at a point where they feel like it's time for them to move on and just start rebuilding the [No.] 19 team to be what the [No.] 20 team is, to be the [No.] 11, the [No.] 54? They have secure situations that are going to be there for years to come.""  Truex is fifth in total points this season (508), with four top-five finishes and seven top-10 finishes, but he hasn't won a race. His last win came at the Crayon 301 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on July 17, 2023. Truex has 34 career wins and was the 2017 Cup Series champion. He's in his sixth season with Joe Gibbs Racing (2019-present). Truex previously had stints at Furniture Row Racing (2014-18), Michael Waltrip Racing (2010-13) and Dale Earnhardt Incorporated/Earnhardt-Ganassi Racing (2004-09 and full time from 2006-09). As for the Briscoe rumor, the 29-year-old is one of four NASCAR drivers who will have a new race team next season, as Stewart-Haas Racing announced last month that it's shutting down after the 2024 season. Truex, 43, is the oldest current driver on the NASCAR circuit; Harvick wants to see Truex go out on a high note. ""I wish he would just say ‘I’m done, this is going to be my last year,' so that we can celebrate Martin. I want the fans and the sport to be able to celebrate what Martin Truex has done in this sport,"" Harvick said. ""I feel like the situation is not positive right now for that type of scenario, and I just don't want him to walk away and say 'I'm done' at the end of year like Carl Edwards did and not be able to celebrate his greatness and his achievements in the sport.  ""He's a champion. He's a winner. He's done everything that he needs to do in this sport … I hate the fact that he might just walk away and be done, and I hope that doesn't happen."" Truex aims to get back on track this Sunday at the Iowa Corn 350. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

But the 36-year-old also admitted ""there's not a lot of time left"" in his career, and that MLS squad Inter Miami will be his ""last club"" in an interview with ESPN Argentina. Messi joined Inter Miami in June 2023, less than six months after completing his expansive trophy collection by leading Argentina to victory over France in the dramatic 2022 World Cup Final. It was seen as a paradigm-shifting move for Major League Soccer, similar to when Inter Miami owner David Beckham came to the LA Galaxy during his own playing career. Messi's comments about Inter Miami deal a blow to some fans' long-held belief that he would finish his club career playing for his boyhood team, Newell's Old Boys, in Argentina.  Inter Miami went from one of the MLS's worst teams in 2023, missing the playoffs despite Messi's midseason arrival, to leading the Eastern Conference standings in 2024, even as Messi has missed some time this season due to hamstring and knee injuries. Miami has also been bolstered by the arrivals of Messi's former Barcelona teammates Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, with Messi's longtime Argentina running mate Angel Di Maria also linked to the club over the past month. Messi won four UEFA Champions League titles, 10 La Liga titles and seven Copa del Rey titles with Barcelona, the club he signed with as a teenager in 2000 and played for until 2021. But he had never won a major international trophy until Argentina defeated archival Brazil in the final of the pandemic-delayed Copa América in 2021.  ""I've done this all of my life; I love playing ball,"" Messi told ESPN. ""I enjoy the practices and the day-to-day, the games. Yeah, there's a bit of fear that it's all ending. It's always there. It was a difficult step leaving Europe to come [to Miami]. ""The fact we won the World Cup helped, it helped a lot, to see things in another way. But I try not to think about it. I try to enjoy it. I do that more now because I'm aware that there's not a lot of time left. So I have a good time with the club, being lucky having good teammates and friends at my side. I enjoy my time with the national team, where I also have good friends, too, and a lot. I enjoy those small details that I know I'll miss when I stop playing."" Messi returned to Argentina after a six-month absence, playing as a second-half substitute in the team's 1-0 win Sunday in a Copa América tuneup friendly against Ecuador. He missed his national team's friendlies in the March international window due to a hamstring injury he had sustained while playing for Inter Miami in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. Argentina opens the 2024 Copa América against Canada in Atlanta on June 20, with kickoff time set for 5 p.m. ET on FS1 and the FOX Sports App. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

20,Eric Williams,Rams’ Cooper Kupp looks to reestablish himself as dominant NFL receiver,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/rams-cooper-kupp-looks-reestablish-himself-dominant-nfl-receiver,"Cooper Kupp missed 13 games the past two years due to injuries, but the veteran receiver is working diligently to get back to All-Pro form.",2024-06-12T17:52:27Z,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — Cooper Kupp feels like himself again, and that could mean trouble for the rest of the NFL. That last time Kupp was fully healthy, he put together one of the most historic campaigns in league history for a receiver. In 2021, he led the league in catches (145), receiving yards (1,947) and receiving touchdowns (16) on his way to earning NFL Offensive Player of the Year and MVP of the Super Bowl. Since then, it's been somewhat of a struggle for the Rams star. In 2022, he missed the final eight games with a nasty high-ankle sprain that required surgery. Last year, Kupp was slowed during training camp with a hamstring injury. He reinjured the hamstring during a joint training camp practice with the Denver Broncos and missed the first four games of the regular season.  Even when he returned, Kupp did not look like his explosive self until later in the year. Kupp told FOX Sports there were spurts when he felt like his old self, but because of a limited runway to prepare his body for a full NFL season due to the lingering hamstring injury, he was unable to properly prepare himself to sustain an All-Pro level of play. In all, Kupp missed 13 games over the past two seasons. Last year in 12 games, he finished with 59 receptions for 737 yards and five touchdowns.  ""I don't know what I could have done differently, aside from sitting out,"" Kupp said. ""If I didn't feel like I was an asset out there, then I wouldn't be out there.""  Now fully healthy, Kupp said he's looking forward to reestablishing himself as a dominant receiver in the NFL. He looked like his old self during OTAs, having the ability to do a normal offseason buildup to training camp.  ""Getting healthy during the offseason was a big deal, being able to do all the things I want to do,"" Kupp told FOX Sports. ""Last season was rehab [from the ankle injury] for all of it until training camp. And so I've been able to go back and … train with the same people I've trained with for the last four years, when I was actually dialed in, and have the same consistency that I've been able to do every day.""  Coach Sean McVay said there has been a noticeable difference in Kupp on the field. The Rams held their last practice at the team's temporary facility at Cal Lutheran University and will move into new digs in nearby Woodland Hills after holding training camp at Loyola Marymount University. ""He's been great,"" McVay said. ""He's been able to establish a foundation. He knows his body really well. [He's] just so conscientious, such a great leader.  ""You've seen a guy that's been able to really put the work in the way he's accustomed to building it from the ground up. He's out here. He's having fun. He's influencing and effecting positive change in his teammates. I can't say enough good things about how special he's been this offseason."" Before OTAs, workouts this offseason at Kupp's home included second-year receiver Puka Nacua, who said he was puking early on because of the intensity. Kupp, however, said Nacua's reports were a little overblown. ""He makes it sound like it was a huge deal, but he's got a little bit of a weak stomach,"" Kupp said with a laugh. ""He's a pregame puker. He's in the bathroom stall before games and people are asking if there's a problem with Puka before games. But it was nothing crazy.""  Kupp said he expects Nacua to continue to perform at an elite level after setting the NFL rookie records for receptions (105) and receiving yards (1,486) last year. ""That's one of the hardest things, when success finds you suddenly,"" Kupp said. ""It's hard to go back and say, ‘I'm going to go earn it again.' He could have easily made the justification of, 'That came quickly; it came easily. What's there to work for?' ""But his willingness to jump back in and go to work, that's the first step to continue to grow and become a better football player. I thought he came out here in OTAs and was moving really well. He looks like a very strong, athletic football player. And I'm excited to see what he can do in Year 2 having done all that work.""  After minicamp, Kupp won't go back to Oregon to train as he's done in years past, choosing instead to train in Southern California with Nacua. ""The goal is to win games, win Super Bowls,"" said Kupp, who turns 31 on June 15. ""That's always what it is. I don't have personal goals that I have set for myself, other than I want to be out there. When training camp starts and Week 1 starts up, I want to be a better football player than I was before, improving and growing from one year to the next. ""If I can be an asset and positive piece to this team, then that's the goal at the end of the day."" [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox? Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.] Kupp still has three years left on an $80.1 million extension he signed in 2022. With receiver contracts skyrocketing, Kupp has dropped to No. 7 at $26.7 million in average annual salary. ""Outside of quarterback, I think you've seen the most growth in the position over the years,"" Kupp said. ""It makes sense, because as the quarterback grows, you have these receivers that have been doing some really good stuff. … I'm really proud of the [receivers] that we've got in this league that are playing at a really high level.""  Kupp intends to be one of them again in 2024.

22,,Is Aaron Rodgers' absence from Jets minicamp cause for concern?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/aaron-rodgers-absence-from-jets-minicamp-cause-concern,"Aaron Rodgers isn't attending Jets minicamp, and Colin Cowherd, Craig Carton and guest Connor Hughes have insight — and different takes on what it means.",2024-06-12T21:06:05Z,"As the New York Jets opened mandatory offseason minicamp this week, there were two notable unexcused absences. One is newly acquired defensive end Haason Reddick, who is entering the final year of his contract and presumably wants a new one. The other is Aaron Rodgers. Details are scarce on why the 40-year-old quarterback is missing minicamp after he appeared at voluntary workouts last month and told reporters he knows the 2024 season is make-or-break for him and the staff in New York after he played just four snaps in 2023. Head coach Robert Saleh said Rodgers was away for a previous commitment that ""is very important to him"" — and something he told the team about ahead of time. On Wednesday, Saleh was asked specifically whether Rodgers was aware the team would term his absence as ""unexcused."" ""I talked about it yesterday, but Aaron and I are on the exact same page,"" Saleh said. ""There's no issue between Aaron — or his teammates, for that matter. So, like I said, we addressed it yesterday. It's more of an issue for everyone outside the building than it is inside. ""And that's about it."" Saleh reiterated that Rodgers had made the team aware of his plans in advance, but backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor said Tuesday he only learned he would be leading the starting offense earlier that morning. That implied neither Rodgers nor the Jets told Taylor — and perhaps his other teammates — that Rodgers would skip minicamp sessions. ""It’s a one-on-one conversation,"" Saleh said of his chat with Rodgers. ""That’s not something the team needed to know about."" FS1's Colin Cowherd said Wednesday on ""The Herd"" that he was told by a source close to the four-time NFL MVP that Rodgers is ""on vacation"" overseas and his whereabouts would be publicly revealed Thursday. Cowherd believes Rodgers' absence, despite Saleh's comments, could signal some tension between the Jets and their quarterback. ""This is what happens when you give a prickly, rich, set-in-his-ways, passive-aggressive quarterback coming to save the franchise and you put him with a defensive coach on the hot seat with an 11-23 record before Aaron got there,"" Cowherd said. ""What you get a is weird power dynamic. … Saleh really has his hands tied, but they've been tied from day one. From the very outset, the power dynamic here has been off."" Cowherd believes that power dynamic, pointing out how the Jets went out of their way to surround Rodgers with familiar faces from the Green Bay Packers like offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett and wide receivers Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb, will prevent New York from contending for a Super Bowl.  ""[The Jets are] a perpetual weird, odd mess,"" Cowherd said. ""An uneven franchise that threw a Hail Mary to get Aaron. … You thought this was going to work? Aaron in Green Bay never liked it that he didn't have as much control as he thought he deserved."" ""The point is, don't be surprised by this. This is sort of what you would expect. Impulsive owner, new general manager, coach with a losing record, prickly, older, at times arrogant, disconnected quarterback in New York City."" SNY Jets reporter Connor Hughes told FOX's Craig Carton on Wednesday's edition of ""The Carton Show"" that Jets officials knew about Rodgers' planned minicamp absence months in advance. ""He actually started putting [this trip] together when he was still injured,"" Hughes said. ""The dates, obviously, had been finalized and set, and when the minicamp dates were finalized and set as well and they overlapped, he immediately let the Jets know and there was an understanding he wasn't going to be there. I think the hysteria has built just because Robert Saleh decided to use the word ‘unexcused,' and the minute he said that, it came off like, 'This is an unacceptable absence from the starting quarterback.' ""Internally, obviously the Jets would love to have their starting quarterback here for minicamp, but I don't think there's any full-blown meltdown over him not being there. In fact, one of the high-ranking executives I talked to yesterday said, ‘Look, do we want him here? Yes. Is him not being there going to impact anything he does come the regular season? Absolutely not. So, this is just another storm the Jets are going to deal with."" Carton agreed that the criticism over Rodgers' absence is ""much ado about nothing,"" pointing out all voluntary team activities Rodgers has been involved in this offseason. However, he believed that the Jets and Rodgers made a misstep by not clarifying publicly beforehand that he would not be at minicamp.  ""You could have just easily said, ‘Hey guys, I just want to make this clear. … For the minicamp, Aaron is not going to be here,'"" Carton said.

23,,Jerry West and the 10 greatest Lakers of all time,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/jerry-west-10-greatest-lakers-all-time,Jerry West was one of the best basketball players of all time. But who joins him among the top 10 players in the history of the Lakers?,2024-06-12T20:31:28Z,"The basketball landscape has been forever changed by Jerry West. The silhouette of the NBA logo sadly passed away Wednesday morning at the age of 86, though his impact as a player and executive will never be forgotten.  West spent the entirety of his pro playing days with the Lakers, with whom he etched his name among the greatest to grace the hardwood while cementing the franchise as one of the most glamorous in sports. Upon retiring in 1974, he had a case as perhaps the best Laker of all time.  Fifty years — and 11 NBA titles — later, there is stiff competition to be included in the Lakers pantheon. With that, here are the 10 greatest Lakers players of all time. Note: players are listed in chronological order Career stats with Lakers: 23.1 PPG, 13.4 RPG, 2.8 APG, 108.7 Win SharesChampionships: 5x (1949, 1950,1952, 1953, 1954)Notable Achievements: HOF, 3x Scoring Champ, 6x All-League, 4x All-Star, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Mikan was one of the most dominant players of his era and was voted the greatest player in the first half-century by the AP. Nicknamed Mr. Basketball, he led the league in scoring three straight seasons and retired as the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Moreover, he led the Lakers to five titles, including three straight from 1952 to 1954. The big man was also chosen to six All-League teams, he's a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team and has his No. 99 jersey retired in Lakers lore. Career stats with Lakers: 27.4 PPG, 13.5 RPG, 4.3 APG, 104.2 WSNotable Achievements: HOF, 10x All-NBA, 11x All-Star, 1958-59 ROY, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Baylor's most notable scoring move was his running hook shot, which he famously utilized the backboard. The undersized big man posted an eye-popping 71 points in a game in 1960, a team record that stood until Kobe Bryant delivered his famous 81-point night against Toronto in 2006. He also delivered a 61-point effort in Game 5 of the 1962 NBA Finals, which remains a Finals record. His 19.8 rebounds per game in 1960-61 is a record for players under 6-foot-8. Career stats with Lakers: 27.0 PPG, 5.8 RPG, 6.7 APG, 62.6 WSNBA Titles: 1 (1972)Notable Achievements: HOF, 14x All-Star, 12x All-NBA, 1969 Finals MVP, 5x All-Defense, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Nicknamed ""The Logo,"" West was an elite scorer, posting a career average of 27.0 points per game, which is the fourth-highest figure among retired players. He led the Lakers in scoring seven times and his average of 29.1 PPG in the playoffs is fifth-highest in NBA history. He and Wilt Chamberlain combined to lead what some believe is the best team of all time, the 1971-72 Lakers, which won an NBA record 33 consecutive games en route to the title. Although West never won a league MVP, he finished in the top five eight different times, including four second-place finishes. He's also the only player to win Finals MVP for the losing team. He appeared in the Finals nine times but came away victorious just once. Career stats with Lakers: 17.7 PPG, 19.2 RPG, 4.3 APG, 63.6 WSNBA Titles: 1 (1972)Notable Achievements: HOF, 1x All-NBA, 4x All-Star, 2x All-Defense, 4x Rebounding Champ, 1972 Finals MVP, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Wilt joined the Lakers for the last chapter of his career and made it count. He managed to lead the NBA in rebounds in four of his five seasons with the purple and gold, while posting 108 games with 15-plus points and 20-plus rebounds. That was 20 more games than any other player during that span, despite Wilt appearing in just 12 games in one of those seasons. Career stats with Lakers: 22.1 PPG, 9.4 RPG, 3.3 APG, 158.7 WSNBA Titles: 5 (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988)Notable Achievements: HOF, 3x MVP, 10x All-NBA, 13x All-Star, 7x All-Defense, 2x Blocks Leader, 1x Finals MVP, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Kareem did it all with the Lakers, helping lead them to five titles. He remained especially good in the playoffs deep into his thirties and is the oldest player to win Finals MVP (38 years old in 1985). ""Cap"" posted 30-plus points 45 times in the postseason and double-digit rebounds 66 times. His 26 games with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds during his Lakers tenure led all NBA players. Moreover, his 108 playoff games with multiple blocks were 36 more than any other player in that stretch. Career stats with Lakers: 19.5 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 11.2 APG, 155.8 WSNBA Titles: 5 (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988)Notable Achievements: HOF, 3x MVP, 10x All-NBA, 12x All-Star, 3x Finals MVP, 4x Assist Champ, 2x Steal Champ, NBA 75th Anniversary Team He's the winningest Laker of all time and, for some, still the most beloved. Magic joined forces with Kareem to spawn the ""Showtime"" Lakers. His 11.2 career assists per game is the highest average in NBA history. He's also one of just two retired players to average at least 19.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game, all figures well below his actual career averages. To this day, Magic's 49 playoff games with 15 or more assists are more than the players with the second and third-most such games combined. Career stats with Lakers: 17.6 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 3.0 APG, 81.2 WSNBA Titles: 3 (1985, 1987, 1988)Notable Achievements: HOF, 2x All-NBA, 7x All-Star, 1x Finals MVP, NBA 75th Anniversary Team A quiet assassin, Worthy averaged 21.1 points per game in his playoff career. ""Big Game"" James routinely saved his best for when the lights were brightest, scoring 20 points or more in 22 NBA Finals games, which is more than Magic Johnson and Shaq had in their Lakers tenures.   Career stats with Lakers: 27.0 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 3.1 APG, 97 WSNBA Titles: 3 (2000, 2001, 2002)Notable Achievements: HOF, 1x MVP, 14x All-NBA, 15x All-Star, 3x Finals MVP, NBA 75th Anniversary Team His relocation from Orlando to Los Angeles made for one of the biggest free-agent signings in NBA history. It would eventually bring about a three-peat — the last to happen in any of the four major sports — with O'Neal claiming each Finals MVP. He and Michael Jordan are the only players in NBA history to pull that off. While with the Lakers, Shaq went for at least 20 points and 10 rebounds 17 times in the playoffs — no other player in that time frame had even 10 such games — and 328 times in the regular season, or 40 more than second-place Tim Duncan.   Career stats with Lakers: 25.0 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.7 APGNBA Titles: 5 (2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010)Notable Achievements: HOF, 1x MVP, 15x All-NBA, 18x All-Star, 2x Scoring Champ, 2x Finals MVP, 12x All-Defense, NBA 75th Anniversary Team Arguably the player most associated with the purple and gold, Kobe spent all 20 of his NBA seasons with the Lakers. His 81 points versus the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 22, 2006 are the most in a game in 60 years and the second-most all time. Bryant's name is all over the Lakers record book, as he leads the franchise in field goals, 3-point field goals, free throws, steals and points. His 88 career playoff games with 30-plus points trail only Michael Jordan and LeBron James in NBA history. Career stats with Lakers: 27.0 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 8.0 APG, 44.3 WSNBA Titles: 1 (2020)Notable Achievements: 6x All-NBA, 6x All-Star, 1x Assist Champ, 1x Finals MVP, 1x IST MVP, NBA 75th Anniversary Team LeBron cemented his place in franchise lore by ending its title ""drought"" in 2020. His 27.0 scoring average is tied with West for the second-highest in Lakers history, as is his 8.0 assists per game. James led the NBA in assists for the only time in his career in the 2019-20 campaign. In the playoffs, his 19 games with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists trail only Nikola Jokić, who has played 32 more playoff games than James since the latter joined the Lakers in 2018.

24,Doug McIntyre,USMNT bounce back from 5-1 loss to Colombia with 1-1 draw with shaky Brazil,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/usmnt-bounce-back-from-5-1-loss-colombia-1-1-draw-shaky-brazil,The U.S. men’s national team earned a morale-boosting 1-1 tie against Brazil in its final friendly match before the 2024 Copa América kicks off next week.,2024-06-13T01:24:01Z,"ORLANDO, Florida - The U.S. men's national team earned a morale-boosting 1-1 tie against Brazil in its final friendly match before the 2024 Copa América kicks off next week. Needing a bounce-back performance after last week's 5-1 drubbing by Colombia, the U.S. turned in a vastly improved display against the five-time World Cup champs in front of more than 60,000 fans at Camping World Stadium. They still fell behind in the first half when Rodrygo finished off a counterattack following a poor giveaway, but USMNT captain Christian Pulisic equalized off a free kick just nine minutes later. Here are a few quick thoughts on Wednesday's contest. Play of the game Brazil coach Dorival Júnior made 10 changes to the lineup that beat Mexico 3-2 last Saturday, with goalkeeper Alisson Becker the lone holdover. Among those he inserted were Rodrygo and Vini Jr., who helped Real Madrid win the UEFA Champions League on June 1. Rodrygo showed his pedigree on his goal. U.S. keeper Matt Turner's long pass to Weston McKennie was short, allowing Bruno Guimarães to intercept. Guimarães headed the ball to Raphinha, who then passed to Rodrygo. One touch later, the ball was past Turner, who had stopped Vini Jr. on a breakaway just moments earlier. Turning point Brazil's opener threatened to demoralize the hosts, who had come within inches of talking the lead when Yunus Musah rocketed a long-range shot off the underside of Alisson's crossbar: So Pulisic's goal was as timely as it was pretty; after being fouled   just outside the penalty area, the U.S. headliner took the free kick himself, his powerful low drive finding a gap in the Brazilian wall, beating Alisson and settling into the side netting: Key stat Turner more than made up for his early miscue by making 11 saves, several of them top-end stops. None was better than this one on Rodrygo with less than 20 minutes of regular time left to play: With their backstop keeping them in the match, the U.S. had a couple of golden chances to beat Brazil for just the second time in 20 tries all-time. Unfortunately for them, Pulisic, McKennie and second half sub Folarin Balogun couldn't find the late winner. It was the first ever draw between the two teams. What's next for the USMNT? CONMEBOL's deadline for participating teams to submit their final rosters is June 15, but the the U.S. is expected to announce its final 26-man squad on Friday. The players who survive the cut — the only real question mark is whether striker Josh Sargent, who's been rehabbing a persistent foot problem and missed both Copa tuneups, will be included — now get a couple of days off to recharge before reporting to the greater Dallas area Sunday. The Americans kick off their tournament slate one week later against Bolivia in Arlington, Texas. What's next for Brazil? Brazil will take a four game unbeaten streak into the Copa América. The Seleção will meet CONCACAF representative Costa Rica in their opener in Los Angeles on June 24. They close out first round play with matches against Paraguay (in Las Vegas) and Colombia (in Santa Clara, California). Doug McIntyre is a soccer writer for FOX Sports.

25,,Should the Lakers' head coaching job be considered top-tier?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/should-the-lakers-head-coaching-job-considered-top-tier,Why aren't coaching candidates champing at the bit to lead the Los Angeles Lakers? Our experts weigh in.,2024-06-12T14:54:33Z,"No, the Los Angeles Lakers were not able to land Dan Hurley. No, there is no clear indication who the team will now target instead of Hurley. No, there is no guarantee that LeBron James will remain with the purple and gold next season. And no, the Lakers' head coaching job should not be considered an attractive one, according to Nick Wright. The ""First Things First"" co-host was brazenly critical about the job's allure on Tuesday, breaking down his case in detail. ""It's not a good job as long as Rob Pelinka's there,"" Wright said. There's a long list of pros and a long list of cons [with the job]. … Its location, its history, which I do think is attractive to NBA players — LeBron James didn't just pick Los Angeles, there are two teams there. He picked the Lakers, and the Lakers' brand still means something similar to the New York Yankees' brand and the Dallas Cowboys' brand. But one of the biggest cons, Wright said, is the front office, specifically general manager and vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka. ""Why is the conversation about Rob Pelinka's job not happening right now, today?"" Wright asked. ""If we take the Lakers ostensibly at their word, they've had a target, they've had six weeks since they fired their coach … they might end up being a man without a country because you couldn't land your guy! … What is the evidence that we have that Rob Pelinka and this Lakers' regime knows what they're doing?"" The Lakers have had seven coaches in the past 11 years, getting just two years out of Darvin Ham and three years out of his predecessor, Frank Vogel. Vogel won a championship in 2020, while Ham brought the Lakers to the Western Conference finals in 2023, before guiding them to the inaugural In-Season Tournament victory this past season.  For ""Undisputed"" contributor Rachel Nichols, the lack of job security the team has offered in recent years, plus the reported six-year, $70 million offer the squad sent Hurley's way, were factors in Hurley's decision to turn down the job. ""This was not a ‘Godfather' offer,"" she said Tuesday. ""The coach of the Detroit Pistons would've made more money than him. And I think part of it is the Lakers weren't looking at this the right way. Maybe they were looking at it as like ‘Hey, we're taking a little bit of a chance, we don't know how he's gonna work out in the pros, this is what we think he's worth.' That's not what it's about. It's not what Dan Hurley is worth money-wise, it's about what he's worth to you, and the Lakers needed this to work out.  ""They fired a coach two years after winning a championship. They fired a coach one season removed after getting to the Western Conference finals. They've had seven coaches in the last 11 years. That is embarrassing, they needed to stop the bleeding, and they don't have a lot of other options. The options they're left with after blowing this is a guy [J.J. Redick] who's never coached after AAU, and a guy [James Borrego] who is a lifetime assistant, who had one head coaching job, who then lost it with the Charlotte Hornets."" Colin Cowherd likened the situation to that of another historically prominent franchise — the Dallas Cowboys. ""These are the Lakers' have-tos: ‘We have to sign 39-year-old LeBron James — 40 in December — to a three-year max contract, because he's our only elite playmaker, and if Bronny's available, we'll have to draft him. That's the current state of the Lakers,"" Cowherd said Tuesday. ""And now you have to settle for probably … your second, third or fourth choice as a head coach. Those are the Lakers' realities.""  ""They also have one of the poorest ownership groups, the second-largest front office in Los Angeles, pretty light on draft capital, and since [Anthony Davis] arrived, they're in the cross-your-fingers business with AD and his health. Those are the realities of the Lakers. It's a little bit like the Dallas Cowboys. The expectations are high, reality is low and the roster is always a little bit overvalued. … So Dan Hurley, in a sport that's in transition, making half the money, said, ‘No thank you.’"" So no, Dan Hurley is not the head coach of the Lakers. And he may not be the only coaching candidate to tell L.A. ""no"" in the coming weeks."
26,,2024 NFL minicamp roll call: Who's in attendance and who's not?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/2024-nfl-minicamp-roll-call-whos-attendance-whos-not,"Haason Reddick is holding out, but why was Aaron Rodgers absent from mandatory minicamp on Tuesday? Here's the latest around the league.",2024-06-11T16:19:58Z,"The end of the NFL's offseason is near, but teams have one last week of preparation before they head out on summer break. By the end of Tuesday, all 32 teams will have begun or completed their three-day session of minicamp. While the vast majority of the offseason workouts are voluntary, minicamp is mandatory. Players who don't attend are subject to fines that could exceed $100,000.  Here's the latest on players who either aren't present at minicamp or are in attendance despite a contract dispute.  Rodgers was absent from the Jets' first day of minicamp on Tuesday. The quarterback's decision to miss practice wasn't contract-related, though. Jets coach Robert Saleh told reporters that it was for an event that's ""important to him,"" but he also noted that it was an unexcused absence. Rodgers plans to skip the entirety of minicamp because he ""prefers to be somewhere else away from football,"" The Athletic reported.  After suffering a ruptured Achilles on his fourth snap with the Jets last season, Rodgers participated in the team's voluntary workouts this offseason. He signed a reworked deal after being traded to the team last offseason.  Chase will attend Bengals minicamp this week, NFL Media reported Tuesday. The wide receiver skipped all of the team's voluntary workouts as is seeking a contract extension. While Chase is under contract through the end of 2025, he became eligible for a new deal this offseason. Chase is seemingly likely to be one of the next receivers to get a big payday following Justin Jefferson's record-setting contract earlier in June. Chase has recorded at least 80 receptions, 1,000 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns in each of his first three seasons. He had 81 receptions for 1,455 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2021. Higgins isn't expected to attend Bengals minicamp this week, NFL Media reported. Unlike all other players, however, the fifth-year receiver isn't subjected to being fined for missing minicamp because he technically isn't under contract.  The Bengals franchise-tagged Higgins earlier this offseason, but he has yet to sign the $21.8 million tender. Cincinnati and Higgins have until July 15 to agree to a multi-year extension. Higgins told reporters in April that he expects to play with the Bengals in 2024. Wirfs was in attendance for the Buccaneers' minicamp practice on Tuesday, the Tampa Bay Times reported. However, he's reportedly not expected to participate in any workouts.  The standout offensive tackle is entering the final year of his rookie contract and didn't attend the voluntary portion of the Bucs' offseason program. Wirfs is a three-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro, likely meaning he's seeking one of the richest contracts at his position.  Entering the final season of his rookie contract, Lamb didn't report to Cowboys minicamp earlier in June and also skipped the voluntary portion of the team's offseason program. Considering the rising wide receiver market, Lamb is also likely to receive a rich deal. He has been one of the game's best receivers since he entered the league in 2020, leading the NFL in receptions (135) and finishing second in receiving yards (1,749) and third in receiving touchdowns (12) last season. Lamb has said that he'll be with the Cowboys this season. ""Absolutely,"" Lamb told TMZ in April when asked if he would play for the Cowboys in 2024 without an extension. ""Yeah, I'll be in Dallas!"" Aiyuk wasn't present for 49ers minicamp last week, sitting in a similar spot as Lamb this offseason. He's also entering the final year of his rookie contract. There have been rumors about Aiyuk's future in the Bay Area for much of the offseason. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch acknowledged in April that the team had trade discussions involving the star receiver earlier in the offseason, but said that ""it doesn't seem that likely"" he'll get moved. Aiyuk was named second-team All-Pro last season with a career-high 1,342 yards. He had 75 receptions and seven receiving touchdowns. Reddick wasn't in attendance for the first day of minicamp on Tuesday. The Jets acquired him in a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this offseason, looking to fortify their pass rush. Reddick is entering the final year of a three-year, $45 million contract he signed with the Eagles and the 30-year-old is looking for an extension with his new team. He has recorded at least 11 sacks in each of the past four seasons, including 16 in 2022. While Reddick isn't present at Jets minicamp, Saleh doesn't seem too concerned about how effective he'll be once the season begins.  ""The guy is a great dude,"" Reddick told reporters. ""He's played at a high level at multiple places. He's a pro and seasoned vet. He's the last guy I'm worried about."" Sutton confirmed that he would be in attendance for Broncos minicamp this week in an interview with the ""DNVR Broncos"" podcast. Sutton skipped the voluntary portion of the Broncos' offseason program after finishing tied for fourth in receiving touchdowns last season (10). He's entering the third year of a four-year, $60.8 million deal he signed in 2021. After missing the entirety of the Patriots' voluntary workout program, Judon was in attendance for the start of minicamp on Monday. He is entering the final season of a four-year, $54.5 million deal he signed in 2021. Judon also didn't participate in training camp last year until his contract was adjusted for the 2023 season. He recorded 28 sacks in his first two seasons with the Patriots before suffering a season-ending biceps injury in Week 4 of last season.  Gregory wasn't present at the start of Bucs minicamp on Tuesday. Coach Todd Bowles told reporters that it was not an excused absence and that the team will ""deal with it."" Gregory joined the Bucs this offseason on a one-year deal.  Cooper was absent Tuesday when Cleveland started minicamp. The Browns' WR1 is entering the final season of a five-year, $100 million deal he signed with the Cowboys in 2020 and is looking for an extension.  Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Cooper’s absence was not excused, but that the team has been in contact with his agent.

""If we don't win, I probably won't be here anymore,"" Southgate told German newspaper Bild. ""Then it might be the last chance. ""I think about half of the national coaches leave after a tournament — that's the nature of international football."" [Check out our Euro 2024 preview] Under Southgate England advanced to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018 — when it lost to Croatia — and was a finalist in 2021 at the last Euros when it lost to Italy in a penalty shootout. England was eliminated from the World Cup in 2022 at the quarterfinal stage by France. ""I've been here for almost eight years now and we've come close. So, I know that you can't keep standing in front of the public and saying ‘please do a little more', because at some point people will lose faith in your message,"" Southgate said. ""If we want to be a big team and I want to be a top coach, then you have to deliver in the big moments."" Southgate has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the Manchester United job if Erik ten Hag is fired during the offseason. But Southgate has so far distanced himself from the debate about his future. Reporting by The Associated Press."
28,,Joey Chestnut reportedly banned from 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/joey-chestnut-reportedly-banned-from-2024-nathans-hot-dog-eating-competition,Joey Chestnut won't be participating in this year's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition due to sponsorship deal with another meat production company.,2024-06-11T18:52:55Z,"Joey Chestnut's reign of dominance at the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition will come to an end in 2024. Chestnut has been banned from this year's competition due to a deal representing Impossible Foods, a company that uses plant-based substitutes for meat products, the New York Post reported Tuesday.  Major League Eating, which runs the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition on July 4, reportedly told the New York Post that Chestnut's decision to endorse a different hot dog brand crossed the line after it was willing to meet his other demands. ""We are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,"" Major League Eating told the New York Post in a statement.  ""MLE and Nathan’s went to great lengths to accommodate Joey and his management team, agreeing to the appearance fee and allowing Joey to compete in a rival, unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day. ""For nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions. However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different brand over our long-time relationship. ""Joey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at the Nathan’s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest.  We hope he returns when he is not representing a rival brand."" Chestnut responded with a statement of his own on social media Wednesday, saying he was ""gutted"" to learn of his ban ""through the media"" and accused Nathan's of ""looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with."" Chestnut received $200,000 to participate in the 2023 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition and had a four-year, $1.2 million offer to continue to compete in the event prior to Tuesday's news, according to the New York Post. Chestnut has historically dominated the event, winning it 16 times. He established a rivalry with Takeru Kobayashi over the years, defeating him for the first time in 2007. Chestnut won the event eight straight times between 2007-14. After losing in 2016, Chestnut has won the event in each of the last eight years. With his dominance at Coney Island each 4th of July, Chestnut has become an overwhelming favorite to win the event in recent years. He held at least -4000 odds to win the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Competition in 2023.  [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

29,,U.S. Olympic chair on Caitlin Clark exclusion: 'Our purview to create the best team we could',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/wnba/us-opts-for-experience-versatility-olympic-womens-basketball-roster-passes-caitlin-clark,USA Basketball says experience was a major reason Caitlin Clark was left off the U.S. Olympic roster that was officially announced Tuesday.,2024-06-11T18:43:16Z,"USA Basketball said experience was a major reason Caitlin Clark was not on the U.S. women's Olympic roster that was officially revealed Tuesday. The selection committee didn't believe the talented Clark had enough high-level reps to be a member of the group headed to the Paris Games. The team includes seven players from the group that won gold in Tokyo — the seventh straight for the Americans. Selection committee chair Jen Rizzotti said the committee was aware of the outside noise and pressure to select Clark, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft who has drawn millions of new fans to the sport from her record-setting career in college at Iowa to now with the Indiana Fever. ""Here's the basketball criteria that we were given as a committee and how do we evaluate our players based on that?"" Rizzotti told The Associated Press in an interview. ""And when you base your decision on criteria, there were other players that were harder to cut because they checked a lot more boxes. Then sometimes it comes down to position, style of play for Cheryl (Reeve) and then sometimes a vote."" Diana Taurasi is back for a record sixth time. Her Olympic career started when she was a WNBA rookie in the 2004 Athens Game, and now the 42-year-old will be on the team again. Other returners from the Tokyo Olympics are Breanna Stewart, A'ja Wilson, Chelsea Gray, Napheesa Collier, Jewell Loyd and Brittney Griner. Besides the returners, the Americans also added 5-on-5 newcomers Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, who helped the U.S. win the inaugural 3x3 gold medal at the Tokyo Games in 2021. Several first-time Olympians will join the team with Alyssa Thomas, Sabrina Ionescu and Kahleah Copper. All three played on the American team that won the World Cup in Australia in 2022. ""It's a great mix of talent across the board in terms of individual skill sets,"" USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said. ""We have veterans, newcomers and those in the middle. Good perspective and continuity is such an important thing and is why we've been successful in the Olympics."" All 12 of those players had senior national team experience. Clark, to no fault of her own, does not. ""She's certainly going to continue to get better and better,"" Tooley said. ""Really hope that she's a big part of our future going forward."" The selection committee has a set of criteria to pick the team that includes playing ability, position played and adaptability to the international game. Marketing and popularity aren't on that list. ""It would be irresponsible for us to talk about her in a way other than how she would impact the play of the team,"" Rizzotti said. ""Because it wasn't the purview of our committee to decide how many people would watch or how many people would root for the U.S. It was our purview to create the best team we could for Cheryl."" Clark wasn't the only talented player left off the team. Ariel Atkins was on the Tokyo Olympic team. Shakira Austin, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton and Brionna Jones all played on the World Cup team in 2022. Aliyah Boston and Arike Ogunbowale had gone to nearly every training camp. Ogunbowale has played well to start the WNBA season, averaging 26.4 points a game — second best in the league. Any of those players, along with Clark, could be taken as an alternate if one of the 12 members of the team is unable to play. There are some questions about Gray's status. The Las Vegas point guard has not played yet this season while recovering from a leg injury suffered in the WNBA Finals last year. Clark has said she will use not being selected for the Paris Games as incentive to get better and potentially make the 2028 Olympic team. ""I think it just gives you something to work for,"" Clark told reporters after practice Sunday. ""It's a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there. I think it's just a little more motivation. You remember that. Hopefully, when four years comes back around, I can be there."" While Clark won't be headed to Paris, Griner will be playing internationally for the first time since she was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months in 2022. She said she'll only play abroad with USA Basketball. ""When you represent your country, you're on the highest stage, it doesn't get any higher than that,"" Griner said. ""Anytime you get to put on the red, white and blue, USA across your chest, we'll get every country's best shot. ... You're playing for so much more. I can't wait to go."" Thomas was excited for her first chance to play in the Olympics. ""It's a huge honor. I stepped away from USA Basketball for awhile, but it was something I grew up watching with my family,"" the 32-year-old Thomas said. ""Just an honor to be part of that group of players. It's a prestigious group."" Thomas gives Reeve the versatility of being able to guard any position as well as facilitate from the forward spot. The Connecticut Sun forward is currently leading the WNBA with 8.5 assists a game. ""This team fits my style of play. The defense aspect, the way Coach Reeve wants to play, I think I'm a perfect fit for that."" Taurasi, who turned 42 on Tuesday, will break the record for most Olympics played in the sport of basketball. Five players, including former teammate Sue Bird, have competed in five. ""The thing that Diana does that I've never seen anyone else do is that she makes everybody around her confident and play their best,"" Rizzotti said. ""Whether she's scoring a point, whether she starts, whether she plays limited minutes, whether she's just a voice in the locker room, she infuses people with a level of self-confidence that has been a factor in us winning,"" The U.S. team will train for about week in Phoenix in July. After that, they'll play an exhibition game against Germany in London before heading to France. In Paris, the Americans will play Japan, Belgium and Germany in Olympic pool play.

30,,"2023 U.S. Open predictions, best bets by Chris 'The Bear' Fallica",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/golf/2023-u-s-open-predictions-best-bets-chris-the-bear-fallica,Chris 'The Bear' Fallica breaks down the 2024 US Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and gives his best bets for the third major of the season.,2024-06-11T18:48:34Z,"""Bear Bets"" are real wagers that Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica is actually making. The third major of the season is here, as the top golfers in the world will tee up for the 124th U.S. Open, Thursday through Sunday, on Course No. 2 at Pinehurst Resort in Pinehurst, North Carolina. Can Scottie Scheffler continue his historic run this season with five wins in his last eight starts?  Or will Xander Schauffele build off his first career major at the 2024 PGA Championship? How about Rory McIlroy's chances to reach the winner's circle at a major for the first time since 2014?  If you want to throw a few bucks on the action, I have you covered with my best bets.  Let's dive into the wagers I’m making this week. Scottie Scheffler to win +300 There really isn’t anything I need to say here. Usually I avoid playing for such a short price in a major, but there’s also the chance we’re looking up at the oddsboard on Thursday afternoon, and suddenly he’s +180. So you’ll be glad you’re holding 3-1 at that point. Ludvig Aberg to win +2200, Top 10 +210 It’s Aberg’s first U.S. Open, but it’s clear he’s got the game to challenge Scheffler, as he finished second to him at Augusta and, even after going in the water on the second nine, wouldn’t go away. He was hampered by an injury at the PGA but bounced back with a top-five finish last week at the Memorial. He’ll be a popular alternative to Scheffler this week, and for good reason.  Min Woo Lee Top 20 +230, Top 30 +130  Lee was fifth last year at LACC and finished just outside the top 20 in the first two majors of the year this year. He’s one of the best drivers out there and avoiding the Open rough will be big this week. He’s not the best putter, but as we’ve seen in the past, putting is the most random of the metrics, so as long as he makes a few putts, we’ll have a nice shot at cashing.  Christiaan Bezuidenhout Top 30 +170 A poor first round prevented him making the cut at Valhalla, but he bounced back last week with a T-4 finish. He’s also posted a top-15 finish at The Players and a top-20 finish at Pebble, so he can play with the best of them. The 30-year-old South African is excellent around and on the greens, so he could gain some strokes on the field this week, as reports are these greens are going to be extremely tough. His best major finish is 30th, so if he can equal that this week, we’ll be in a good place.  Rory McIlroy Top 10 +125 Five straight top-10 finishes in the U.S. Open to go along with three more top-10s and a win earlier in his career. He may not win, but he knows how to grind at an event which can be as much mental as it is physical.  Tom Kim Top 30 +115 Kim has played 10 career majors and posted a top-30 in six, including, both majors this year and three of the four last year. So, while he hasn’t emerged with a bunch of wins, as many of us thought he might have given his international performance, remember he’s still just 21. He's been one of the more consistent cut makers in major championship golf over the last two years.  Sepp Straka Top 10 +550, Top 30 +125 Missed the cut at the PGA and missed the cut in the sandwich event (Valspar) between the PLAYERS and Masters. In those other seven events, though, he finished with three top-fives, and nothing worse than 16th. Straka was runner-up to Brian Harman at the Open last year.  Collin Morikawa Top 10 +150 The 2021 Open champion has finished in the top four in three straight events and was third at the Masters. It’s clear he’s out of the career lull he went through in parts of 2022 and 2023 and is back to being a top five/10/win threat every week. As is always the case, can he make enough putts to go along with his pristine iron play? Only Scheffler — and maybe Schauffele — are in better form right now, so hop aboard the Morikawa money train.  TO MISS CUT Patrick Cantlay +160, Adrian Meronk +110, Max Homa +175, Jon Rahm +215*  Rahm may not even play as he has a toe injury, and he’s off the board in some spots, but you’d have to think he goes and will likely struggle or WD if the pain is too much.  Meronk has played six majors in the U.S. and missed the cut five times, including both U.S. Opens.  Homa has missed the cut in four of his five U.S. Opens and hasn’t been in his best form this year.  Cantlay hasn’t missed a cut in a major since 2022, but he was a mess at the Memorial last week and was a non-factor at the PGA.  FIXED PARLAYS AT DRAFTKINGS Xander Schauffele Top 5, Sahith Theegala Top 10 and Min Woo Lee Top 20 +6500 Ludvig Aberg Top 5, Sahith Theegala Top 10 and Sungjae Im Top 20 +11000 I’ve never played any of these sportsbook pre-arranged parlays because they are usually losing propositions.  But I do like to go through to get ideas for some things I could either play, or play against separately.  I am going to throw some pizza money on these two, as none feel too far-fetched, given Theegala’s play in big events this year.  Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica has covered sports for nearly three decades.

31,Chris Fallica,UEFA Euro 2024 odds: Chris 'The Bear' Fallica's best futures bets to make now,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/uefa-euro-2024-odds-chris-the-bear-fallicas-best-futures-bets-make-now,"The 2024 Euros are here and Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica is sharing his best futures bets before the big show. Find out which teams he's betting on to advance, plus a Golden Boot long shot.",2024-06-11T18:58:05Z,"""Bear Bets"" are real wagers that Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica is actually making. The UEFA Euro tournament is finally here, and you can watch all the amazing action unfold on FOX Sports and the FOX Sports App over the next month. It shouldn't be much of a surprise to fans or bettors that England and France are two of the pre-tournament favorites to win it all. With that in mind, opening week is upon us, so I've identified a few futures bets I'm making before the fun really gets started. Let's go ahead and dive into my best bets. Netherlands to reach Quarterfinals (+115) The Dutch will likely finish second in the group behind France, and that would likely put them in a Round of 16 match with Ukraine. I’d like their chances to advance there behind a team that is very good in the midfield and on defense.  PICK: Netherlands to reach quarterfinals (bet $10 to win $21.50) England to reach Final (+140); France to reach Final (+160) It's probable that France and England will meet in the semis on the bottom half of the bracket as group winners. That would obviously mean one has to reach the Final, and I would favor France there. Something would have to go very wrong and surprising for these two teams to not make deep runs. If one were to put $100 on France, you would lock up a $51 profit so long as one of them does reach the final. Obviously, there's a risk, but I think France is the best team in the tourney and should be in the Final.   [Check out our Euro 2024 preview] PICK: England to reach Final (bet $10 to win $24 total)PICK: France to reach Final (bet $10 to win $26 total) Name the Finalists — France and Portugal (+1600) Roberto Martinez’s side is loaded and should win Group F, giving it a decent path to at least the semis. I guess the one concern would be if Cristiano Ronaldo doesn’t perform. In that case, will Martinez remove him from the XI, and if so, how would that affect the team? The likely opponent would be France, but if you wanted to take a little Portugal/England, you could do that, too. I’m also taking the two — France at +390 and Portugal at +800 — to win the tournament.  PICK: France and Portugal to be Finalists (bet $10 to win $170 total)PICK: France to win tournament (bet $10 to win $49 total)PICK: Portugal to win tournament (bet $10 to win $90 total) Golden Boot Winner Romelu Lukaku, BEL +1600; Phil Foden, ENG +3000; Artem Dovbyk UKR +4700 I’m looking for some alternatives to Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe. Lukaku and Dovbyk benefit from being in a group with Romania, which is one of the weaker sides in the tournament. Dobvyk and Ukraine get first dibs on it in the opener, and then Belgium and Lukaku face Romania second. Kane is the name everyone is mentioning on England, but Phil Foden had a monster domestic season with Man City. And while his international career has been spotty at best, it's quite possible he made that leap this year and could have a huge summer for one of the tournament favorites.  PICK: Romelu Lukaku, BEL Golden Boot (bet $10 to win $170 total)PICK: Phil Foden, ENG Golden Boot (bet $10 to win $310 total)PICK: Artem Dovbyk, UKR Golden Boot (bet $10 to win $480 total) France/Belgium/Germany/Spain/England/Portugal to advance parlay (-238) Some may not want to lay -238 on a parlay, but I will. Each of these teams are favored to emerge from their respective groups. And remember, there are third-place teams that will advance as well. Spain has the most difficult group of the six but should still get out.  Parlay: France/Belgium/Germany/Spain/England/Portugal to advance (bet $10 to win $14.20) Most AssistsAntoine Griezmann, FRA +1600; Jeremy Doku, BEL +2500 France goes as Griezmann goes. He’ll be crucial with his crosses to put both Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud in the best possible scoring position. While Belgium goes through Kevin DeBruyne, don't underestimate his Man City teammate Jeremy Doku’s ability to get involved in goal production and setup either.  PICK: Antoine Griezmann, FRA most assists (bet $10 to win $170 total)PICK: Jeremy Doku, BEL most assists (bet $10 to win $260 total) Switzerland to reach quarterfinals (+255) Assuming the Swiss finish second behind Germany in Group A, it means they will have a Round of 16 meeting with Croatia or Italy. Both of those teams can have trouble scoring goals and likely would against a team that's very strong in goal and on defense. How budding star Dan Ndoye is used could be the difference in a Round of 16 departure or a deeper run.  PICK: Switzerland to reach quarterfinals (bet $10 to win $35.50) Team to allow most goals — Romania (+1400) Romania will be the bottom feeder of the group with high-powered Belgium, as well Ukraine, which is led by La Liga leading scorer Artem Dobvyk. I’m assuming it allows at least six in those two games and who knows what will happen against Slovakia. Sure, there's a risk, as we’re looking at a team that isn’t going to advance and only has three games. But once we get into the knockout rounds, we’re likely looking at tight, low-scoring games. So I’ll take a shot here at a price.  PICK: Romania to allow most goals (bet $10 to win $150 total) Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica has covered sports for nearly three decades.

32,Carmen Vitali,"Bears, Packers' wildly different offensive team-building approaches shaped by their QBs",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/bears-packers-offensive-team-building-approaches-shaped-qbs,"The Bears and Packers have wildly different offensive team-building approaches, and it stems from how much they trust their respective QBs.",2024-06-11T20:04:04Z,"The Chicago Bears.  The Green Bay Packers. Founding franchises. Bitter rivals. About as opposite as they come. That especially rings true with their offensive team-building strategies. One team has a plethora of high-priced talent. The other has the plethora of talent, but is paying pennies on the dollar for said talent. And it might all speak to how much they trust their quarterbacks. Despite what the Packers said publicly leading up to the 2023 season, they weren't exactly tempering their own expectations of quarterback Jordan Love. Green Bay knew Love would be entering his first season as starter after three years of riding the bench behind Aaron Rodgers and yet, they made no splash additions to Love's arsenal. There were no proven veterans brought in. They didn't take a wideout in the 2023 draft until the second round. Their top players at the position were entering their second year.  No matter what head coach Matt LaFleur said publicly, the Packers were betting on Love. It paid off. Surely, it was a testament to LaFleur and his playcalling. You can see it develop throughout the season. LaFleur gave Love a lot of quick passes, shorter reads and kept things relatively simple in the beginning as Love got used to the pace of the big leagues. Love's issue was never his grasp of the playbook, it was his lack of live reps and game experience.  But even in the early aughts of the season, Green Bay saw some success. Aided by motion, which the Packers deployed at the sixth-highest rate in the NFL, LaFleur gave Love his choice of targets. So many targets. And it put stress on opposing defenses, who never knew who Green Bay's top receiver was. They still don't. Ten players caught touchdown passes from Love last year. Five of them multiple times. Jayden Reed and Romeo Doubs tied for the team lead in touchdowns. Eight such scores were all it took. There was no single player for opponents to key in on each week leading up to the game.  One week it was Reed, like in Week 1 against the Bears. The next, like Week 13 against the Chiefs, it was Christian Watson. Sometimes it was even tight end Luke Musgrave, who finally got his wide-open score in the wild-card round against the Cowboys. Love had so many options that occasionally, balls bounced off one receiver's hands in the end zone and another receiver was there to catch it, like in the fourth quarter against Denver when Love threw a touchdown pass to Reed by way of Doubs. Someone was always open thanks to this rotating cast of wide receivers, along with a couple (rookie) tight ends who had a knack for being exactly where they're needed to be. Love had the second-most easy targets in the league last year, according to Next Gen Stats. His receivers had the third-best wide-open percentage. ""Wide open"" is classified by a receiver having five or more yards of separation from his nearest defender. That was all accomplished because defenses simply didn't know where to turn. It also requires an incredible amount of trust in your quarterback to keep it all straight. As the season went on, you saw Love get more comfortable. You saw Green Bay's playbook open up a bit more. You saw Love read the field better, get through more advanced progressions, improve his decision-making all around. You saw Love warrant that trust. And thank goodness. Green Bay's gamble on spending next to nothing on its weapons could have gone very poorly. But it didn’t. Ironically, only now has Green Bay invested in an offensive weapon when they replaced running back Aaron Jones with Josh Jacobs, who they paid an uncharacteristic $48 million for four years. He was the best back on the market and now he’s the eighth-highest-paid player on the Packers’ roster. He's their highest-paid skill player, by far. He’s one of only three offensive players in the top 10, which includes Green Bay’s quarterback. And now the Packers are primed for yet another successful season without ever having to take a step back and rebuild. Now, contrast that with their neighbors to the south, the Bears. As part of a trade out of the first overall pick in 2023, general manager Ryan Poles insisted wide receiver D.J. Moore came with the slew of draft capital acquired. Moore instantly elevated the offense — he had the second-highest catch rate over expectation in the NFL. He had the fourth-most single-season receiving yards in franchise history last year with 1,364. That was also a career-high for Moore.  But the Bears offense needed more — much more. Justin Fields had the fifth-worst success rate among qualified quarterbacks in 2023, per NGS. He had the fourth-worst completion rate. Chicago decided it wasn't going to let that happen again. In addition to letting Fields go and drafting a quarterback prospect touted as the best in years with their first overall pick this year (thanks to the Carolina Panthers) in Caleb Williams, they also used their second top-ten pick to take a receiver that their quarterback already took a liking to. Not content with Rome Odunze and D.J. Moore, the Bears had also acquired wide receiver Keenan Allen in a March trade with the Los Angeles Chargers. Add in tight end Gerald Everett and running back D'Andre Swift as free agency pickups and all of a sudden, Williams has an embarrassment of riches in his offensive arsenal. But that all came at a premium.  Odunze speaks for himself as a top-ten pick. Chicago parted with a fourth-round pick for Allen. They'll also have to pay him after this year should they want to keep him around. Swift was the first splash signing of free agency and given a three-year, $24 million deal.  The Bears are trying to do for Williams what the San Francisco 49ers have done for Brock Purdy: insulate themselves against bad quarterback play. Now, Purdy didn't end up playing poorly last season. Williams might not end up playing poorly this year. But Chicago has made sure that even if Williams doesn't perform, it won't be their fault. They've surrounded him with everything he could possibly need. Chicago doesn't quite trust Williams yet — and why should they? He's a rookie after all. Players like C.J. Stroud, who hit the ground running (to say the least) with the Houston Texans in his first season, are the exception, not the rule.  The high-priced weapons around Williams are the Bears' way of making sure they aren't asking Williams to be Stroud this season. They should only need average quarterback play to see a decent amount of success. Also consider that should Williams pass for 3,900 yards and 30 touchdowns, which is a pretty run-of-the-mill stat line for an NFL quarterback, he won't just have had the best season by a rookie quarterback in Bears' history, he will have had the best season of any quarterback in Bears history. Chicago has invested a lot in trying to make that happen. That's the exact opposite of what the Packers have done in Green Bay, and Love threw for 4,159 yards and 32 touchdowns in his first year as the starter. We know the Packers way has worked for them. This season will be about seeing if the antithesis of all things green and gold works for their counterparts in Chicago.  Carmen Vitali covers the NFC North for FOX Sports.

33,Martin Rogers,Are Cristiano Ronaldo's ex-teammates turning on him in the GOAT debate with Lionel Messi?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/cristiano-ronaldos-ex-teammates-turning-him-goat-debate-lionel-messi,Cristiano Ronaldo's former teammates have always stayed loyal to him when asked if he or Messi were the GOAT. That's changing now.,2024-06-11T21:36:15Z,"Euro 2024 might be Cristiano Ronaldo's last chance to win a major international trophy — and possibly the final opportunity to prevent himself from going down in history as the B-side to Lionel Messi. Ronaldo or Messi; who is better? — has been a question that's become soccer's version of LeBron James or Michael Jordan for more than a decade, but the hypothetical battle has tilted significantly against the Portugal superstar over the past 18 months. Messi's victory with Argentina in the 2022 World Cup, in the minds of many, struck the decisive blow in the argument, perhaps cementing the Argentina legend in the position of top dog for this generation. The interesting thing about this clash of extraordinary talents is that it's not just one for the fans. Ronaldo cares about it, so does Messi, although the latter does a better job of hiding the fact. And it is a conversation that has become entwined with their former teammates for a variety of reasons. For years, there was an unwritten rule that if a player had played club soccer with Ronaldo, they would state his name whenever quizzed about who was the modern-day GOAT.  If they'd played with Messi, you get the idea, they'd plump for him. Germany legend Toni Kroos admitted as much in 2018, telling reporters: ""We were not only teammates but also neighbors in the dressing room and neighbors in real life. Cristiano lived right by me. ""Seeing what a perfectionist he is was impressive. That is why it is forbidden for me to name Messi."" But then things began to shift. Ronaldo's reputation took a hit in 2022 when his second spell with Manchester United disintegrated into acrimony and poor performance, and ultimately ended with him announcing a move to Al-Nassr of the Saudi Pro League. Weeks later, Messi finally lifted the Jules Rimet Trophy, scoring twice in an epic World Cup final against France and again in the penalty shootout. Game, set, match, undisputed GOAT? Perhaps so. When Kroos was quizzed at the end of that tournament, he had changed his tune. ""Messi deserves it,"" Kroos told Magenta TV, when asked the inevitable question about all-time greatness. ""In terms of individual performances at championships, I've never seen a footballer play as consistently as this guy.  ""You have to remember that he has never played for clubs that I find appealing. That proves I mean it."" Then Wayne Rooney, who spent years alongside Ronaldo at United but was not necessarily the closest of friends with him, crossed the divide by also naming Messi. ""I have the greatest respect for Cristiano and when people argue he is the greatest, I know where they are coming from and respect that opinion,"" Rooney wrote, in London's Times newspaper. ""But, for me, Messi is just different."" To be clear, the topic is still not universal.  There remain plenty of Ronaldo loyalists happy to make their voice heard, especially when he is criticized. Former colleagues including French striker Louis Saha and Polish goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak, have been swift to come to Ronaldo's defense, and it is hard to find a Real Madrid player who doesn't rave about his time there. However, heading into the Euros — which begin on Thursday with Germany v. Scotland (3 p.m. ET on FOX) — there is also an ultra-harsh school of thought among pundits that Portugal is better off when Ronaldo is on the bench. Such beliefs surely stem more from what happened at the last World Cup than the Euros qualifying campaign, where Ronaldo was outstanding as Portugal became the only team to win each of its 10 qualification games. Ronaldo and company begin their campaign against the Czech Republic on June 18, and will be favored to advance comfortably from Group F, which also features Turkey and Georgia. FOX soccer expert Alexi Lalas believes Ronaldo's rivalry with Messi, who represents Argentina in the upcoming Copa América, still has some serious legs. Ronaldo's only title with Portugal was the 2016 Euros, but he was forced into a spectator role after coming off injured early in the final. ""These great rivalries, like Borg-McEnroe, Magic-Bird, they are great duos that are not by design, they just evolve,"" Lalas told me.  ""Ronaldo and Messi push each other, they make each other better, and even in that grudging respect there is some resentment. They are so different, but they would admit they are better because of the prodding and pushing and pulling of wanting to be better than the other.  ""And, when you step back and look at it, as soccer fans we are all the beneficiaries of that, too.""

34,,Steelers sign head coach Mike Tomlin to 3-year extension,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/steelers-sign-head-coach-mike-tomlin-3-year-extension,The NFL’s longest-tenured head coach just signed an extension with Pittsburgh.,2024-06-10T20:04:31Z,"The NFL's longest-tenured head coach isn't leaving Pittsburgh anytime soon. The Steelers signed Mike Tomlin to a three-year extension on Monday that will carry through at least the 2027 season. Tomlin was about to enter the final year of the deal he agreed to in April 2021. The 52-year-old Tomlin is 173-100-2 since taking over for Hall of Famer Bill Cowher in 2007. Tomlin has yet to endure a losing season and despite speculation late last season that he was considering taking some time off, he remains intent on trying to help the Steelers stay in the mix in a highly competitive AFC. ""I am appreciative for this contract extension and thankful for Art Rooney II for his support during my first 17 years in Pittsburgh,"" Tomlin said in a statement. ""We are continuing to work diligently to get back to where we belong — sustained playoff success with the ultimate goal of winning the franchise’s seventh Lombardi Trophy."" Pittsburgh is coming off an eventful 10-7 season that ended with a first-round playoff loss to Buffalo. Tomlin was asked in the immediate aftermath about his future status, and rather than answer, he abruptly stormed off the podium. A few days later, the relentlessly energetic Tomlin hardly sounded like someone on the verge of burnout, stressing he was ""on go"" as he looked to 2024 and beyond. ""I coach football, that’s what I do,"" Tomlin said in January. ""I’m respectful of the position that I hold. I have no sense of entitlement in terms of what I do. I just got a high level of respect for what we all do in this space, and I try to earn it daily."" While Pittsburgh has been consistently competitive under Tomlin, the franchise also hasn't won a postseason game since the divisional round of the 2016 playoffs, an eight-year drought that marks the club's longest since the ""Immaculate Reception"" in 1972. Tomlin's decision to stick around extends an unmatched level of continuity atop an organization that's had just three head coaches since 1969. Yet the Steelers have also made a series of moves of late that suggest the team is no longer content with merely being in the mix in mid-January. In the past year alone, Tomlin fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada midseason, the team's first in-season dismissal of a high-level coach since World War II. Pittsburgh spent the offseason completely overhauling its quarterback room, signing Russell Wilson in free agency, trading away Kenny Pickett and acquiring Justin Fields from Chicago. Tomlin has used the word ""excited"" in recent months to talk about Pittsburgh's immediate future. The new contract indicates owner Art Rooney II's commitment to letting Tomlin try and find a difference-maker at quarterback, something that's been an issue since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement following the 2021 season. ""Mike Tomlin’s leadership and commitment to the Steelers have been pivotal to our success during his first 17 years as head coach,"" Rooney said in a statement. ""Extending his contract for three more years reflects our confidence in his ability to guide the team back to winning playoff games and championships, while continuing our tradition of success."" The Steelers have mandatory minicamp this week then take a break before reporting for training camp at Saint Vincent College on July 24. Reporting by The Associated Press.

Aaron Judge, who started the Yankees' first 67 games, was given a night off from the starting lineup. Soto was in the No. 2 slot and Anthony Rizzo was left out of the lineup for the second straight game. Soto is batting .318 with 17 home runs, 53 RBIs and a 1.027 OPS. The 25-year-old outfielder, acquired in December from San Diego, can become a free agent after the World Series. A scan Friday did not reveal any problems with his elbow, the Yankees said. Judge, the Yankees captain, is batting .305 with a major league-leading 24 homers, 59 RBIs and a big league-leading 1.139 OPS. Rizzo, in a 1-for-29 slide this month, is hitting .224 with seven homers and 25 RBIs. Reporting by The Associated Press."
36,John Fanta,"Why Dan Hurley chose to stay at UConn, and what's next for Huskies' head coach",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/why-dan-hurley-chose-stay-uconn-whats-next-huskies-head-coach,"FOX Sports' John Fanta provides an in-depth look at Dan Hurley's decision to turn down the Lakers' coaching job and stay at UConn, where he will chase a third straight national title.",2024-06-10T23:59:05Z,"Dan Hurley became the new face of men's college basketball when he and his UConn Huskies wrapped up a second consecutive national title this past April, catapulting the head coach into company with Mike Krzyzewski and Billy Donovan as the only men's college coaches to win back-to-back titles in the last 40 years. Hurley has images of John Wooden around his office, and looks to the basketball legend as an inspiration, wanting to join him as the only other men's college hoops coach to win three consecutive national titles. The drive for history, his Northeast family roots, and a loyalty to Alex Karaban — who tested the NBA Draft waters — along with players he brought in such as five-star freshman Liam McNeeley and transfers Aidan Mahaney and Tarris Reed, all propelled Hurley to staying at UConn for what will be his seventh season.  In turning down the Lakers, Hurley passed on a chance to go to the NBA after being offered a reported six-year, $70 million contract. Sure, he has expressed a desire to go to the NBA, and the Los Angeles brand speaks for itself, but the Lakers' organization has more questions than answers right now, and the biggest one was an unknown: How much control would Hurley have? With LeBron James still part of the equation, history would tell us the answer to that, at least to start. At UConn, that is not a question, and beyond the emotions and the feel-good nature of this story, think about this: Hurley has Connecticut in the palm of his hand. Sources confirmed to FOX Sports that UConn has mapped out an offer of roughly $50 million for six years, coming in at over $8 million per year. But after Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said Monday that ""we'll make sure he's the top paid college coach,"" it will be time for the state and the school to back up his words.  This past November, two-time national champion Bill Self and Kansas agreed to an amended contract worth $53 million over five years with a check of more than $13 million issued to the Naismith Hall of Famer for the 2023-24 season.  So, Hurley is on track to receive a nice payday, and if the governor's words have merit, we'll see that figure on the rise and finalized at some point soon. As for Hurley's visit to Los Angeles, the trip to meet with the Lakers' brass left the Huskies' head coach in deep thought as he was impressed with what the organization presented to him, a source confirmed to FOX Sports. ""This was not some flight to Los Angeles just to find some sort of leverage play or to go on a weekend vacation,"" a source said. ""He entertained the Lakers offer like any college coach should, fully examining it and giving thought to it.""  Hurley flew back from Los Angeles on Saturday following the Friday meetings with Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka, making the trek back East and heading to New York City to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden, where he was able to unplug for a couple of hours in Manhattan with his wife Andrea and assistant Luke Murray.  But at the end of the day, Hurley going to see Joel at MSG — donning a ""New York, New York"" shirt — is exactly why he's going to continue to call the Northeast home. In a span of 816 days, Hurley has gone from losing to New Mexico State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to winning the last 12 March Madness games by a combined 260 points. Hurley, who previously dealt with a mental health battle during his time as an undergrad at Seton Hall, has his family and support system with him in the Northeast. His dad, Bob Sr., is a fixture at UConn games. He met his wife, Andrea, during his college days. His son Dan Jr. graduated from Seton Hall and has a government job in New Jersey. His other son, Andrew, just graduated from UConn. You don't mess with happy. While the Lakers are a brand as prominent as any in professional sports, the organization has had seven coaches in the last 15 seasons, and nobody since Phil Jackson has lasted more than three years. In addition to this being a celebratory day for UConn's men's basketball program, Hurley's return to Storrs is also a mammoth win for college basketball. For a sport that has recently said goodbye to Jay Wright, Krzyzewski and Roy Williams on the sidelines, college hoops has lacked a lead personality that can drive the bus for the sport into the future amid all the doomsday talk and negativity surrounding the game. This could have been a massive blow to the sport, and you would have seen the narrative heat up that college basketball continues to hurt. Instead, Hurley returning is a boon for college hoops and the Big East. Hurley is the type of guy who has to be at a place where basketball is the priority, and he has that at UConn, playing in a league that is driven by the sport and has accounted for four of the last eight national championships. Hurley's Huskies will continue to land on big broadcast TV for almost, if not every, weekend during conference play next season. He can be a media darling, playing a variety of games at Madison Square Garden, including one against Gonzaga on Dec. 14. And finally, he is at a school where he has undivided, total control. As Hurley heads to Orlando for the NBPA Top 100 camp this week, he now gets to tell recruits that he turned down Kentucky and the Lakers in the same offseason. That is a massive recruiting boon for a place that's had no issues winning as of late, and will now have a pair of top-tier draft prospects, Donovan Clingan and Stephon Castle, set to be selected in the top 10 of the NBA Draft in Brooklyn later this month. With a top-five roster in place and all of this momentum, Hurley's decision also further cements Connecticut's spot as a definitive blue blood. If there's a point higher than cloud nine, UConn has reached it with Hurley saying no to one of the defining organizations in sports and saying yes to setting aim at history with the Huskies.

Ham spent the past two seasons with Los Angeles, sporting a 90-74 regular season record, while taking the LeBron James, Anthony Davis & Co. to the Western Conference finals in his first season at the helm. He was fired in May after the Lakers lost their matchup with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2023-24 playoffs. The Nuggets also swept the Lakers in last year's Western Conference finals.  Ham, 50, returns to the place where he won the 2021 NBA Championship as an assistant to then-Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. He had previous assistant coaching stops in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Ham was a sought-after assistant coaching candidate this spring, according to ESPN, but chose to reunite with Milwaukee and superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo instead of rejoining with Budenholzer, who took over as the Phoenix Suns' head coach earlier this offseason. The Bucks, who were limited by injuries to Antetokounmpo and co-star Damian Lillard, were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers in six games in the first round of the playoffs.

39,Joel Klatt,Sherrone Moore reveals promise Jim Harbaugh made before becoming Michigan's coach,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/sherrone-moore-reveals-promise-jim-harbaugh-made-before-becoming-michigans-coach,"Michigan coach Sherrone Moore joined Joel Klatt for the season premier of ""Big Noon Conversations."" The two discussed Moore being named the Wolverines' head coach, the team's incredible national championship run and more.",2024-06-10T18:50:22Z,"""Big Noon Conversations"" is back for its second season, and I couldn't be more excited. Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore joined me for the season premiere of the summer series on my podcast, ""The Joel Klatt Show."" Fresh off the Wolverines' national championship win, the first-year coach gave some insight on the process of replacing Jim Harbaugh following his departure to the NFL and coaching Michigan through a dramatic moment in the College Football Playoff. He also relived his memorable postgame interview following the win over Penn State. Here's a snippet of my conversation with Moore.  [Read more: Michigan has new-look secondary following quartet of transfer additions] First things first, what's the best part about being the Michigan Wolverines' head coach? Walking in every single day into this beautiful facility with all of these great kids and people. Just understanding and knowing that everybody looks to us, looks to me, as the head coach of this great university. Being around the players every day is the best part for me. I love that. I'd love for you to take us back to that moment when you knew that Coach Harbaugh got the job with the [Los Angeles] Chargers. We had talked, I have always known this was in your aspirations. But take me into what it was like for you and when did you realize this was going to be the move they were going to make? Well, I was in the Houston airport, heading to Dallas. … I had just talked to coach (Harbaugh) probably like, three hours before that. He was kind of like, ""Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen. I think it could happen soon. It could happen today, it could happen tomorrow, or it could happen next week."" I was like, ""OK it's going to happen at some point. I've just got to be ready."" I was … going through TSA, and it popped up on my phone: ""Jim Harbaugh to the Chargers."" … That second, my phone — text messages, calls, text messages, calls from our AD, our assistant AD calls and says, ""You've got to come back right now."" So, I did the interview that next day and got the job on Saturday, had the press conference and was on the road recruiting by Monday. It was a humbling experience. I know you probably prepared for this and that these were Jim's aspirations, as close as your staff was, and that you wanted to set yourself up for that. What I thought was unique, covering this sport for a long time — whether it was a guy like me on the outside pounding the table immediately for Sherrone Moore or the players and fan base — it was in unison. It was very rare. It was universal that Sherrone Moore was going to be the head coach at Michigan. How did it make you feel to have that support? I felt honored. It felt like all the hard work that I put in with this team, these players came to fruition. It's something that you can't really describe, but I'm just very humbled to have Wolverine Nation, all of the players, coaches, you and some media to say, ""Hey, he should be the head coach at Michigan."" When I first got here seven years ago, I just wanted to be the best tight ends coach I could be. At some point, I wanted to call plays. I got a chance to do that with our young guys. The opportunity to be the head coach here was really not in my mind. When this did take place, it was very humbling for me. When did it enter your mind? It entered my mind when Coach Harbaugh told me, ""You're going to be the next head coach of Michigan."" When did he tell you that? This year he told me that. He said, ""I don't know when, I don't know what's going to happen, no man who can say the future tells the future."" He gave you a Harbaugh-ism. That's how he is. He's like that all the time. He just said, ""You're going to be the next head coach of Michigan."" I was just like, ""What?"" He was just like, ""I'm going to put it in my contract that if I ever leave or go somewhere, you're going to be the next head coach of Michigan."" This man — who's a legendary coach [and] done it all, and we have a chance to make a special run — is telling me I'm going to be the next head coach here? What does that mean? It means I've gotta work my tail off for this man. He trusted me and this offense to do everything possible to help him and his team win. So, I just worked as hard as I could this year. You got a taste of being an acting head coach last season. What did you learn from those experiences when you had the reins on game day?  I learned that you're always in the spotlight. There's always somebody watching you, but the decisions you make not only impact that side of the ball, but the whole team and how important, diligent, and detailed you need to be in your preparation of all that. I was very humbled, again, to be in that position to do that.  The first game that it happened was the Penn State game. It was an environment that's close to unmatched in any college football arena, especially for an away team. It was loud, volatile, fun and invigorating, but it was something our players gravitated toward, and they loved that. They loved being the villain. It was a special, special feeling. You can't bring up that game without me bringing up your interview with Jenny Taft at the end. That was an epic, authentic and one of the best interviews that she's ever gotten. She was so happy at the end of that. I know you probably weren't as happy. She was like, ""Sherrone was authentic. That's how excited he was. There was no facade there."" What was that moment like for you? All the emotions that you could feel in anything exciting, that's what I felt. The hard work, the dedication that the players put in, that Coach Harbaugh put in this program, all came out in that moment. For people on the outside that think our players didn't win fairly or do something or do that, it was just kind of like, ""OK, bet. This is what we're about."" We're going to attack the moment. We did. Now, what can you say about us? Without our head coach, we proved ourselves right, that we can go win in this big environment. It was a moment that was unfiltered. Unfortunately, the bad words came out, but I apologized to my mom, so that's OK. Did you get a text or a call from your mom? Oh, yeah. I got reprimanded a little bit. It was my mom and my grandma. I tried to make sure they weren't too mad at me, but they understood the moment. The players, I think, appreciated it because I think in the world today, emotion is seen as weakness. I don't see it as that. So, people can say whatever they want, but we accomplished something pretty special last year. The run late in the season, between an epic Rose Bowl Game — I mean, my goodness — and then what I would categorize as the prototypical Michigan victory over Washington. You were just going to wear them down, wear them down, wear them down and wear them down some more. The CFP run, what was that like, internally? Something I've never been a part of. You knew that the team's preparation was a little different. We adjusted some things from our standpoint, the coaches' standpoint, from how we approached bowl practice to make sure we weren't worn out. Versus the previous seasons? Yeah … a couple of different things. Whether it was meeting time, more time for themselves, a little bit of practice time adjusting. [We] still kept the physicality in what we did, but we just adjusted a little bit. That helped, but it was really the players' mindset, how they approached everything. It's funny, people talk about the reaction to seeing [we'd be playing] Alabama. When those cameras turned off, the boys were like, ""That's who we wanted. That's what we wanted to do."" To be the best, they say you've gotta beat the best. They've been the King of the Hill for a long time. I know Georgia has won two national championships, but Nick [Saban] had six of them. So, you knew if you wanted to get to the top, you had to face a team like that to get there.  They were excited for that game and ready. The preparation they had throughout that month was super special. I'd be in the office at 10 o'clock, and I'd see guys in the film room, watching film, doing this, watching cut-ups, texting me at night, ""Hey coach, what about this look? What are we doing here?"" It was something that I've never seen. You can talk about prep, mindset and culture — but when it has to manifest, and you're down 20-13 with under four minutes to go and you've got to drive on the Bama defense just to tie the game. Walk me through that last drive. Two instances will always be held forever in my mind. Really, three. Before that drive, I [had] never really been nervous to call a drive, never really been anxious. That drive, I was looking around, I looked at the clock, I looked at the time and was like, ""This is the most important drive in Michigan football history."" That's how I thought of it. I looked up to the sky and asked my grandpa, ""Hey pops, need some help here. Help me out, love ya."" I'll never forget, I was walking and all the linemen were strapping their helmets on. J.J. [McCarthy] comes up to me and says, ""Hey, pops, we got ya."" I was like, ""Oh yeah, we about to go score on this drive."" We had been moving the ball a little bit, but not as much. That drive we went down and scored. The fourth-and-2 call, we ran it, had a play-action on third-and-2 with [Alex] Orji in the game. It didn't work out. They had it covered. It was fourth-and-2, and I knew [Harbaugh] was going to say, ""Go for it."" I already knew what call we were going to do. I knew the pick route. I knew how it was going to set up because we had shifted in motion and made it look the same the whole game. We ran duo. They were calling our run. Then, Blake [Corum] pops open and goes down the field. Roman [Wilson] gets the block in the back, so guys were like, ""Oh no, are we coming back?"" I was like, ""No, we still got the first down."" We got the first down, called a run option with J.J. We hadn't ran that all game. I was like, ""OK, this is the time."" Then, came back to a play-action that we called earlier in the game, but the route spacing wasn't right. We fixed it on the sideline. Then, Roman popped open, made an incredible catch, made the guy miss as he landed. The play that I called second, I was actually going to call first, if we got a little closer. All of a sudden, I called the play-action to Roman. He slipped out and it was a touchdown. That drive will hold true forever in my mind.

40,Bob Pockrass,Can Kyle Busch salvage his frustrating season?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/can-kyle-busch-salvage-his-frustrating-season,Kyle Busch is mired in one of the toughest stretches of his career despite being just 8 points out of a playoff spot. Will he get on track?,2024-06-12T16:31:09Z,"Kyle Busch got wrecked and ran out of gas on the final lap Sunday at Sonoma Raceway. And it was still his best finish in his past four races. That speaks volumes of the recent stretch for Busch as that 12th-place finish had followed a 27th at Darlington, 15th at Charlotte and 35th at Gateway. Mixed in there was the fight with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. following the all-star race. He has dropped from 11th in the standings to 15th (and at one point was 17th).  A driver who has finished top-10 in 55 percent of his Cup starts entering this season has just five top-10s in 16 starts this year. No wonder Busch said that has been one of the toughest stretches in his career. And that was before Ross Chastain got into him on Sunday. Although Busch ran out of gas by the end of that lap, it appears he didn't feel he had an issue before being turned. Denny Hamlin, on his ""Actions Detrimental"" podcast, indicated that the data he saw showed Busch had an issue, which Chastain said he thought as well. But Busch also was on older tires, and Chastain, on fresher tires, also might have just gotten a run on him he didn't expect. And despite all the talk about the struggles, he sits just eight points out of a playoff spot at the moment, however, Kevin Harvick said on his ""Kevin Harvick's Happy Hour"" podcast he's ready to push the panic button on Busch. That might be tempting but this team's performance has been mercurial enough that it's possible if they just make the most out of their days, they will make the playoffs. He has started top-10 in four of the last seven races. In the three races before Darlington, he had finished top-10 in five of the six stages. And that came at three different tracks at Talladega, Dover and Kansas. If he can get those top-10 starts and earn stage points, as long as there aren't too many new winners outside the top-16 in points, he should make the playoffs. Granted, just making the playoffs is not the goal, but if he can make the playoffs, there is that opportunity to win and advance. And would anyone truly be surprised if Busch pulls off a win? Granted, they aren't running well, but he is talented enough that if they hit the sweet spot occasionally, he could put it in victory lane. Busch has 63 career wins and desperately wants a win not just to make the playoffs but to continue his streak of winning every season, a streak that currently sits at 19. No one would be surprised if he wins this weekend at Iowa. And no one would be surprised if he finishes 20th. That hasn't always been the case for Busch. But he's in pretty good company when it comes to that in the Next Gen car this year — Joey Logano, the other two-time Cup champion other than Busch, among them. This isn't to imply that Busch is the championship contender at the moment that he would want to be. And he is unlikely to emerge as one during the season. But he can take steps toward that at Richard Childress Racing. There's reason to be concerned but not to panic just yet.  And this isn't the time to say it should be the end of the Busch-RCR relationship — that would be short-sighted. This is a team that won three races with Tyler Reddick in 2022 and then three more with Busch last year. Yes, they have not won in 37 consecutive races, more than one full season. But crew chief Randall Burnett is one of the best in the garage and Busch is obviously one of the best as the drivers. The nature of the Next Gen car is when things are just a little bit off, it is difficult to make up the difference. That isn't going to change if Busch starts looking for another team. Busch's best move: Know that things go in cycles and with the work he has put in to win 63 races in his career — including three last year — should help him out of this slump. At RCR.

All that's left for the two sides is an agreement, and that might be imminent.",2024-06-12T17:21:48Z,"Jordan Love senses that he'll have an extension from the Green Bay Packers soon. The Packers starting quarterback told reporters that he's hopeful a deal will be done by the time the team opens up training camp on July 22. ""Yes. That's what I've heard,"" Love said when asked if an extension could be completed prior to training camp.  The confidence from Love that a deal would get done sooner rather than later came after Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst recently expressed a desire to get the contract done in the coming weeks. ""We're in those conversations right now,"" Gutekunst told 97.3 The Game in Milwaukee last week. ""Both parties want the same thing. We'd like to get this done before training camp, for sure."" In a separate interview with Cheesehead TV on Tuesday, Gutekunst shared why the team wants a deal in place with their quarterback by training camp. ""I would love to have it done a couple weeks ago, that would be great,"" Gutekunst said. ""To have stability at quarterback, particularly with Jordan, would be something that is good for the organization, good for our team. I think I'm optimistic because I think both we want Jordan here, and Jordan wants to be here. There's a desire on both sides to get something done. Would love to have it done before training camp, I think that would be ideal. Whether or not that happens, we'll see how it goes."" Guteknust added that he's ""not overly concerned"" about the situation, though. ""More importantly is the fact that we have an opportunity here to take the quarterback position and make it very stable for us for the foreseeable future,"" Guteknust said. ""That's exciting.""   Love mostly played coy when asked by reporters about the specifics of his contract situation, keeping his answers relatively brief. Although he shared that he likes ""being in the mix"" about where things stand in contract negotiations.  ""That's that,"" Love said with a smile before nodding his head when asked if there was a topic he'd like to discuss less than his contract. The Packers made a second investment in Love last year, before he officially became their starting quarterback. They gave him a one-year extension with $13.5 million in guaranteed money with $9 million in potential incentives, a move that seemingly bought them extra time to see if Love could be their long-term quarterback. Well, Love proved to be right for the part last season. While he didn't start the year too well, he finished by throwing for 4,159 passing yards, 32 touchdowns and 11 interceptions with a 96.1 passer rating. Love's improved play over the course of this season not only helped the Packers make the playoffs, but they also upset the Dallas Cowboys and nearly took down the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers.  In addition to negotiating a new deal, Love is also focused on where he wants to improve in his second season as a starter. The 25-year-old shared what he's been working on this offseason to possibly elevate himself and Green Bay to the next level.  ""The main thing for me is understanding where to go with the ball, always making the right decision, not forcing the ball downfield and trying to fit it in certain windows, things like that,"" Love said. ""Just process, and understanding where I need to go with the ball, and then pocket movement, making smaller movements in the pocket, not being so quick to try and get out of there, but to stay in the pocket and try and find those receivers downfield. That's something I've been working on. ""Also throwing on the move, going right, being able to get my shoulders downhill, my body downhill and not be drifting away from the throw."" As for the betting odds, Love is currently +1400 to win MVP at DraftKings Sportsbook.  He has the fifth-lowest odds to win the award, only trailing Patrick Mahomes (+475), Josh Allen (+850), CJ Stroud (+850) and Joe Burrow (+900).  [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

42,Rowan Kavner,"John Smoltz on Dodgers-Yankees, NL wild cards and a new pitching wave",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/john-smoltz-dodgers-yankees-nl-wild-cards-new-pitching-wave,"John Smoltz weighs in on former relievers thriving as starters, the recent Dodgers-Yankees series and NL teams likely on the fence about buying or selling.",2024-06-12T17:31:03Z,"As the only player in big-league history with at least 200 wins and 150 saves, John Smoltz knows a thing or two about what it takes to thrive as both a starter and a reliever. The transition from the bullpen to the rotation is becoming more of a trend for some of Major League Baseball's top arms. Seth Lugo made the successful move last year, and recent full-time relievers Reynaldo López, Jordan Hicks and Michael King are doing the same in 2024. As part of a new weekly conversation with Hall of Famer John Smoltz, the MLB on FOX analyst provided his thoughts on how to handle the former relievers thriving as starters this year, his takeaways from this past weekend's potential World Series preview between the Dodgers and the Yankees, the cluster of NL teams likely on the fence about buying or selling at the trade deadline and more. Kavner: You were at a fun matchup over the weekend between the Dodgers and Yankees. It was a star-studded one that was maybe dimmed a little bit by Juan Soto's absence, but you still had a lot of possible MVPs taking the field. What were some of your takeaways from the series, particularly regarding New York's lineup without Soto?  Smoltz: Both of these teams have looked the part when everyone's healthy. When the top four or five for the Dodgers are doing their thing, they look unbeatable. They need a little bit more depth in their lineup, but with the Yankees, of course, Soto is a game-changer. And without him, it's a little more average. Their pitching has exceeded everyone's expectations, but their offense is what's going to be dangerous when Soto and Aaron Judge are doing their thing.  Both teams look like favorites to represent each league, but a lot can happen, and there are times when teams look vulnerable. I love the 162-game journey because at certain points we fall in love with teams, and then we fall out of love with teams. I think these two teams, a little past the one-third mark of the season, made for a pretty intriguing matchup. And, of course, the Dodgers had been playing mediocre of late until they got to Yankee Stadium and won the series.  Dodgers DH Shohei Ohtani and outfielder Teoscar Hernandez   You also got to see Yoshinobu Yamamoto up close. He was a more than $300 million investment, making him the highest-paid pitcher in the sport, and he's been really good since his forgettable debut. But I think this last outing in that environment — it felt like a playoff situation — that was the most dominant start we've seen from him. What growth have you seen from him over the past two months? Well, the biggest thing against the Yankees is he had an elevator to his fastball velocity; he ramped it up. His ability to command the baseball and make hitters look silly has been really good over the last five starts or so. And I think what the Dodgers saw in Japan, they're now getting. The key's going to be keeping him healthy because he's a frontline, swing-and-miss-type pitcher. When you get to the postseason, that's what you need.  The Dodgers, the last couple of years, the reason they didn't make the long journey to the World Series is because they didn't have the health and the rotation. I think they've put together a collection of pitchers that have the frontline traits and an overall staff that can go through the gauntlet once the postseason starts. Yamamoto certainly tuned it up in front of New York and its fan base, and the history of that franchise didn't bother him at all.  I'm curious about your thoughts on a recent trend, and it's one I think you are uniquely positioned to talk about. There seems to be a reliever-to-starter pipeline developing. We saw it with Seth Lugo last year, but now you're seeing it in a bit more bulk with Reynaldo López, Michael King and Jordan Hicks, among others. With the successful emergence that you're seeing with that transition, how would you handle these guys? We're approaching the halfway mark of the season, so a lot of these guys are close to their career high for innings.  A lot of this is the byproduct of de-developing greatness. And I've said it a lot: They put a lot of these guys in the bullpen to eat up what they consider, analytically, important innings. But these guys were starters by nature who served a different role. I call it de-development because they didn't have the opportunity to bring along their second, third and fourth pitches. Basically, you come in and provide a service by eating up some of these middle innings. But I've said it for a long time, when you try to take away the value of starting pitching and compartmentalize so many innings with the bullpen, this is what you get.  As for the pitchers you mentioned, they're now getting a chance to do what they really were always meant to do. They're having to build their innings up again, so you're going to have to look at that in a very creative way and try to balance that great run that they're on, but still, how do you sustain it? This is an industry problem that has been going on for a long time, that we awakened to thinking that they were relievers that now became starters. It's the other way; they were starters who were put in the bullpen for, again, the reasons that analytics and the Department of Choices made. But these guys are just being able to now fully put together what they were going to do, originally.  It started about seven, eight, nine years ago with the Milwaukee Brewers and having three starters in their bullpen in that infamous playoff series against the Dodgers. They had Brandon Woodruff, Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta. They were all relievers, but they were starters in waiting. So, now you see what those pitchers have had to go through with the injuries, and it just delays the greatness, I think, of a lot of potential pitchers who we just assumed could only eat up 60 innings. So, how would I handle them? As long as they're pitching free and repeating their mechanics, let them go. Let the eye test, without the absurdity of throwing 50 more innings than they did the year before, I think there's some balance in using that wisdom.  Three of the 14 top qualified ERAs belong to guys that we just mentioned, so clearly it is possible to have success converting them back to starters. Do you think teams have a grasp yet on the best way to do this, or are we still in a trial period?  Well, from my observation, in the last 10 years, we don't develop in the minor leagues. We bring guys up early because of the necessity of arms; there's so many injuries, and I just don't think they're ready. And so, organizations think the best way to accomplish the innings that they need is to put them in the bullpen, bounce them back and forth, and then have this kind of elevator system until they get to the point where they can maybe give them the starting nod. I think it's a little backward. But again, I don't have any say in it. Organizations are having to run out 30-40 pitchers per year on average to get through a big-league season, and a lot of it is because of what I just mentioned.  I want to dive a bit further into the National League, where there's a huge group of teams hovering around .500 — the Cubs, Reds, Cardinals, Pirates, Giants, D-backs, Padres and Nationals. Which of those clubs do you believe in and like as potential contenders, and which ones do you expect will have to be honest with themselves and turn into sellers?  It's such a logjam of the same kind of team. Many teams are going to have a hard time deciding whether to trade away their assets when they're really close to a playoff spot. I do like the Cincinnati Reds. I've liked them from the beginning of the year; it looks like they're getting back on track. Pittsburgh is so intriguing with their arms that if they were to somehow make the playoffs, good luck facing those arms, if they're able to kind of pitch at that time of the year within innings limits.  You got some of these teams really not ready for the postseason because their time frame isn't being met with what their success is, so it's going to be interesting to see how they divert that. The Milwaukee Brewers have done it a few times, where they've been close and traded their greatest reliever in Josh Hader. They've never really shown the capacity to add. The pressure on them this year will be interesting. If you've got a seven-game lead, and you do nothing, that's not going to go over well with the fan base. I think the team that is very intriguing that will have to make decisions is the New York Mets. The Mets technically are still in the playoff hunt. They have a lot of teams they have to pass. They have a roster that probably could be very attractive to some teams that are looking to add.  So, I just think this thing always has a way of working itself out. The teams that are honest with themselves, saying, ""We realistically don't have a chance even though the standings may show that,' are going to be the teams that surprise a lot of people by making some moves. I think the Washington Nationals are closer than people will give them credit for because the roster has totally changed with the trades they've made, and they're playing great. There's going to be a surprise; there's no doubt. There's going to be a team that maybe gets close to .500 and makes the postseason that basically takes the model of the Arizona Diamondbacks and goes, ""They did it, why can't we do it?"" You mentioned the Brewers, what do you make of that group? This is a pretty decent sample now. They get rid of their best pitcher in Corbin Burnes, and now you have Joey Ortiz looking like one of the best rookies in baseball. Somehow that pitching staff has made it go, and that offense has been great. Do you believe in what you've seen so far? They know how to win, and they've adopted the underdog mentality — their leadership and Pat Murphy — they just don't see any reason why they can't be the team. It's a wide-open division, and I think they could end up taking it. Again, a lot depends on their health and whether they add or stand pat.

43,,Manchester United manager Erik Ten Hag to reportedly keep job after performance review,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/man-united-manager-ten-hag-to-keep-job-after-performance-review-ap-source-says,"Erik ten Hag will stay on as Manchester United manager and is in negotiations to extend his contract, a person familiar with the situation tells The Associated Press",2024-06-11T22:30:29Z,"Erik ten Hag will stay on as Manchester United manager and is in negotiations to extend his contract, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Tuesday, confirming multiple reports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision had not been publicly announced. The decision ends months of uncertainty over Ten Hag's future after he oversaw United's worst league campaign in 34 years, but ended the season by winning the FA Cup with a victory over Manchester City. United carried out an end-of-year review after last month's cup final and decided to stick with Ten Hag, who has won two trophies in as many seasons since joining the club from Ajax in 2022. The FA Cup followed the English League Cup, which Ten Hag won in his first year at Old Trafford. But his second season in charge saw the 20-time champion suffer its lowest Premier League finish — eighth — losing 19 times in all competitions. Ten Hag keeps his job in the face of a major overhaul of United's soccer operations by new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe. British billionaire Ratcliffe bought a 27.7% stake in the club in February and has hired a new CEO and technical director, with a sporting director on the way. Ten Hag, who won three Dutch titles with Ajax, was Ratcliffe's last major call. He survived despite failing to meet Ratcliffe's challenge of securing Champions League qualification for next season. Ten Hag is United's fifth permanent manager since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 during a period of decline on the field. It has gone 11 years without winning the title. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer all failed to return the club to its past glories. Ratcliffe assumed control of United's failing soccer operations after investing $1.3 billion in shares and injecting a further $300 million cash into the club. He has quickly begun his overhaul with the appointment of former Manchester City executive Omar Berrada as CEO. City's former academy head Jason Wilcox has been hired as technical director. Newcastle's Dan Ashworth is set to become sporting director. Reporting by The Associated Press. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Goals from Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer — both surprise picks in the starting lineup — left Switzerland in control at halftime but Barnabas Varga's header put Hungary back in contention. Breel Embolo made sure of the win when he scored on the counterattack in stoppage time with a lob over the goalkeeper. Earlier, Duah opened the scoring in just his second game for Switzerland, shooting low past goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi off a pass from Aebischer. Aebischer made it 2-0 just before halftime, sidestepping away from Attila Fiola to find space on the edge of the box to hit a curling low shot past Gulacsi. Varga's diving header in the 66th off Dominik Szoboszlai's cross brought celebrations for Hungary as some of its black T-shirt-wearing hardcore fans lit flares. Hungary kept Switzerland under pressure after that but couldn't find a second goal. Switzerland is second in Group A after host nation Germany beat Scotland 5-1 on Friday in the tournament opener.

The Astros are hopeful that the 41-year-old right-hander won't need to go on the injured list. He is listed as day to day. ""Missing a start, it’s not something you want to have happen,"" Verlander said.

""It wasn't worse, it just kind of like flared up a little bit on me,"" he said. ""And after a couple of my games, it’s been a little stiff and then I’ve been able to work through it and throw and get all the stuff I needed to get done. But during the bullpen, it flared up on me a little bit and I just kind of pulled the shoot and tried not to be stupid about it and push it like I normally would."" The three-time Cy Young Award winner is 3-2 with a 3.95 ERA in 10 starts this season. Spencer Arrighetti, who was scheduled to start Sunday, will start Saturday in place of Verlander.

Messi went the full 90 minutes for manager Lionel Scaloni after playing 35 off the bench in a 1-0 win over fellow Copa América contenders Ecuador on Sunday in Chicago. He previously missed a pair of international friendlies in March with a hamstring issue that has also contributed to his half-dozen absences for Inter Miami in MLS play. But his sharp performance Friday — in which he also struck the woodwork with a free kick and contributed to a sequence leading to a penalty kick goal — should ease Argentine concerns ahead of next Thursday’s group-play opener against Canada in Atlanta. Going the distance also gave Messi reps with 15 Argentina field players during the match. ""That was basically the idea, maybe to look for something different, a chance to improve,"" Scaloni said through an interpreter. ""Angel Di Maria came in, and he played more on the inside because the way the game was shaping up it gave us the opportunity to try new things."" Lautaro Martinez also scored twice for the defending Copa América and World Cup champions against a Guatemala side that's 108th in FIFA’s world rankings. That included Argentina’s goal from the penalty spot, a role Messi typically assumes during tournament play. ""Leo Messi decided,"" Scaloni said. ""I don't know exactly what happened on the field, if he was asked or he decided to give it to him. This shows how kind Leo Messi can be."" Guatemala took a surprise lead in the fourth minute when Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez redirected a chance resulting from a free kick only as far as defender Lisandro Martínez, who inadvertently bundled the ball across the goal line. The lead lasted only eight minutes before Messi tied it when Guatemala goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen's errant pass found the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner directly in front of an open goal about 12 yards out. In the 38th minute, Messi's feed sprung Valentin Carboni into the right side of the penalty area, forcing Guatemala defender Nicolas Samayoa to haul down the winger with a sliding challenge that resulted in Lautaro Martinez's penalty shot. Martinez scored his second in the 66th minute after Enzo Fernández's ball over the top found Messi, who provided a perfect, one-time service back across goal.

50,Martin Rogers,Euro 2024: Nicolo Barella sparks Italy fightback with spectacular strike,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/euro-2024-nicolo-barella-sparks-italy-fightback-spectacular-strike,Nicolo Barella saves Italy after early setback in conceding the quickest goal in Euros history,2024-06-15T21:17:31Z,"Defending champion Italy survived conceding the quickest goal in European Championships history to begin its campaign with a crucial 2-1 victory over spirited underdog Albania. Nicolo Barella struck what turned out to be the winning goal after just 16 minutes with a fierce strike from the edge of the area, and the Azzurri joined Spain as the clear leaders of Group B. Barella made no mistake when the ball fell to him in space and eased Italian nerves after what had been a tempestuous start to the game at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. Nedim Bajrami incredibly scored the opener just 23 seconds into the game, capitalizing on an ill-placed throw-in to take a touch and then smash the ball past goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. But Italy responded with spirit and some poor marking allowed Alessandro Bastoni a free header from close range, with the big defender making no mistake in the 11th minute. Having taken the lead, Italy found its composure, and was mostly in control during the second half, however, Donnarumma was forced into a critical save in injury time to clinch a vital three points. Luciano Spalletti's will now take on Spain in Gelsenkirchen on Thursday, a contest that may decide to outcome of the pool that has become known as Euro 2024's version of the Group of Death. Albania, with an incredible following that saw its supporters occupy the vast majority of the seats on Saturday, will try to revive its campaign against Croatia in Hamburg the previous afternoon. For Italy, Barella looks set to continue to be a crucial part of its success, his midfield role vital in virtually all aspects of Spalletti's system. Italy might have received little attention leading into Euro 2024, but they are very much part of it now, and will not give up their title without a fight.

51,Ralph Vacchiano,Jayden Daniels already showing he's the start of something good in D.C.,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/jayden-daniels-already-showing-hes-start-something-good-d-c,"No. 2 overall pick Jayden Daniels received the first shot at the Commanders' starting QB gig, and it's already becoming his job to lose.",2024-06-13T16:34:32Z,"The entire Washington D.C. area has already rolled out the red carpet for Jayden Daniels. He's thrown out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. He was a special guest when the U.S. men's soccer team played a friendly against Colombia. He can feel he's the center of attention wherever he goes. That comes with being the No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 draft and the franchise quarterback the hard-luck Commanders have been dreaming about for decades. But Daniels seems to understand that fame can be fleeting. His star will fall if he doesn't quickly live up to all the hype. ""I mean, I ain't a star quarterback yet,"" Daniels said after a minicamp practice on Wednesday. ""I got a long way to go."" But at least he'll have plenty of time to get there. That's because the 23-year-old Daniels certainly appears to be entrenched as the Washington Commanders starting quarterback. He got most of the first-team reps at minicamp this week, despite the presence of his veteran backup, Marcus Mariota, and there's no indication at all that will change once training camp begins. There has always been dueling schools of thought on how quickly to throw rookie quarterbacks into the fire. Some prefer them to sit and learn — either for weeks, months, or sometimes even years behind veteran quarterbacks. Others think it's better to let them start from the beginning so they can get the mistakes of their learning curve out of the way. And though Commanders coach Dan Quinn won't commit to anything this early, it seems clear that Washington is leaning towards the latter. This will be Daniels' team, for better or for worse — or at least as long as they can tolerate any of the bad. ""I think what's important for Jayden, as the reps are now happening, (is) how are you doing in the execution of those?"" Quinn said on Tuesday. ""The expectation is just to see how familiar he is with the concepts. We've put in a big package. Now it's about execution."" That's a coachspeak way of saying they are throwing everything they can at Daniels now to see if he's capable of handling it — so they can begin to gauge if they can trust him to run the offense once the regular season begins. And the early returns were excellent. He's had an outstanding spring, according to those who have watched him closely. And he's dazzled at times with both his arms and his legs. He's also begun to win over his veteran teammates with both his humble nature and his work ethic. He has routinely been one of the first to arrive at the Commanders' facility each day. Daniels said he usually arrives around 5:45 a.m. And he's kept his focus on ""learning how to be a pro,"" not the trappings that come along with that. ""He's going to be a really good player because of the time and the work that he puts in,"" said Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin. ""I don't think I've had a young quarterback that really has come in and, within the first week, he's like, ‘Hey, can we (work on) this route?' or, ‘Let me get this rep after practice?' It's exciting for me."" ""I'm proud of the strides he's made so far,"" said new Washington running back Austin Ekeler. ""(He's) embraced the leadership role. Things that I love to see, especially from the quarterbacks, is if you don't like a route, your calling me up. He's done that a few times after practice we are out here getting routes."" That sometimes can be tough for a rookie quarterback to do. And it can often be even tougher to get the veterans to appreciate. But Daniels, in just six short weeks, has managed to earn his teammates' respect. To keep it, though, he'll need to transfer that to the field — something no one will know for sure if he'll be able to do until September. All he can do now is put in the work and hope that eventually it will all pay off. ""I would just say as you rep more things, obviously you start getting the grasp of the playbook,"" Daniels said. ""But I mean, I still got a long way to go to be where I want to be. (I) try to perfect it, try to be a perfectionist as much as possible."" That's exactly what the Commanders want, of course. They don't want him standing and watching and learning from the examples of others. They want him on the field with the first team as often as possible trying to perfect his craft. That will likely be their approach when training camp starts in late July, even if Quinn doesn't immediately declare the quarterback job to be Daniels' to lose. But it is, and they don't expect him to lose it. They think he's ready to prove he is everything they expect him to be. That's what they've seen this spring. ""Not only does the physical traits show up, its the work ethic,"" Quinn said. ""I think that through the years and through the season, you guys will feel that and see that."" The Commanders see it already. That's why Daniels will get his chance to turn around the franchise right from the start.

52,Ben Arthur,"State of the RB position: Coaches, former stars weigh in as QBs, WRs grab spotlight",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/state-rb-position-coaches-former-stars-weigh-qbs-wrs-grab-spotlight,"Amid the NFL’s evolution into a pass-dominated league, we asked coaches and former players about where the running back position is headed.",2024-06-13T16:58:02Z,"LeSean McCoy grew excited watching the 2023 NFL Draft.  In the two running backs taken early in the first round — Bijan Robinson to the Atlanta Falcons at No. 8, Jahymr Gibbs to the Detroit Lions at No. 12 — the former Pro Bowler saw more than just running backs. He saw special offensive weapons. He saw a perfect blend of speed, agility and elusiveness.  He was particularly high on Robinson, who starred at Texas. McCoy was convinced that Robinson would one day ""change the game"" for running backs.  ""Them dudes are going to set the market back on fire,"" the SPEAK co-host said.   The running back market has been a hot topic in recent years, as the NFL has evolved into a pass-first league.  The value of the position in the modern game has been discussed ad nauseam by league observers. We saw the top running backs last offseason grow frustrated over the depressed market. This offseason, several backs secured the big-money deals they couldn't in 2023, though their contracts still pale in comparison to other non-quarterback skill positions. This offseason, the wide receiver market has exploded, with one pass-catcher after another resetting the market. Reigning AP Offensive Player of the Year Christian McCaffrey, whom many consider the league's premier running back and one of the best overall players, secured an extension with the San Francisco 49ers last week worth $19 million per year — an average annual value surpassed by 22 receivers, according to SpoTrac.   The way McCoy sees it, the elite running backs who've just been paid have to play well to continue to push the envelope financially for the position, to show teams their impact on winning.  After a stagnant 2023 offseason, the running back market started to move with Jonathan Taylor's three-year, $42 million extension with the Indianapolis Colts in October. The 2021 rushing triple crown winner, Taylor missed seven games due to injury but returned to All-Pro form by the end of the year, rushing 30 times for 188 yards and a touchdown in Week 18 against the Houston Texans.   Before McCaffrey's extension, Josh Jacobs and Saquon Barkley secured free-agent deals worth at least $12 million annually with the Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively.  ""So now, when it's like, ‘OK, do we pay running backs?' Well, we got to. They are the lead of their offense,"" McCoy said. ""The problem is when you pay your running backs, they don't do well and you get a guy in the fourth round or undrafted, like Austin Ekeler, and he balls out. It's like, ‘Damn, well I don't have to pay a superstar because they're not producing and because the guys that are undrafted or undervalued are winning.'"" Running backs who are elite rushers and bring receiving prowess are valued at a premium in today's NFL. Those are the ones who get paid.  It's why McCaffrey has been the league's highest-paid running back by average annual value for five seasons and counting. It's why the New Orleans Saints' Alvin Kamara, who has 5,829 rushing yards and 4,219 receiving yards in seven seasons, is the second-highest paid.  Not only are NFL offenses more reliant on pass-catching options out of the backfield, but coaches like Dolphins offensive coordinator Frank Smith are also seeing more running back prospects with the skill set to succeed in the modern game.  ""The big thing is just always making sure you're maximizing your players' abilities,"" Smith told FOX Sports. ""College football, watching it for the last 15 years, just seeing that there's more of a gravitation toward a lot of the teams running the spread, four-wide receiver systems and stuff like that. So it's a little bit different with the backs. ""There are fewer of those [six-foot] backs,"" he continued. ""Not to say they don't exist anymore. What happens is that when you play that style of play in college, a lot of the time they take those bigger athletes and might move them to other spots because of an athletic need.""  Pro Football Hall of Famer Edgerrin James sees the state of offensive football as an advantage for running backs. In the pass game, they're often covered by linebackers, who are bigger but typically slower than tailbacks. It's why James encourages kids playing the position to understand the pass game and coverage holistically and to welcome the idea of a multi-back rotation.  ""It's going to make it to where backs will have the potential to actually play longer,"" James told FOX Sports. ""So look on the bright side: You get one guy that gets out there, he does it and he gets beat up. But now, you got to where you get some help and not taking as much of a toll. So you have to look on the bright side of it also. If you have two, three backs, guess what? You're going to last longer. You get a chance to be in the league longer. You get a chance to have success longer."" Smith and Titans tight ends coach Justin Outten, who was Tennessee's running backs coach and run game coordinator last season, believe there's still a place for dominant backs who don't have pass-catching value. It depends, they said, on a team's identity.  The Titans offense, for example, revolved around Derrick Henry the past several seasons. The Ravens, Henry's new team, have had a run-first offense for years, though it has centered around star quarterback Lamar Jackson.  ""You're always going to have a guy that you want to lean on in the fourth quarter in four-minute situations,"" Outten told FOX Sports. ""A guy that can set up play-action. You have to run the ball if you're going to set up play-action, to get guys to step up and respect it. I don't think that's going to go away anytime soon.""  Added McCoy: ""If you just watch the playoffs, running the ball matters."" But the former players and NFL coaches acknowledge that the ability to pass protect is critical for running backs today, regardless of their receiving proficiency.  James calls them the ""last line of defense"" to protect the quarterback. ""If you can do one thing and survive the NFL as long as you can, you have to be able to protect,"" Outten said. ""If … you're a helluva runner breaking tackles, that's great, that's what you can lean on first and second down. But you have to have a guy that can survive on third down and protect. So there's got to be some sort of guy on your roster that has the capability to hold up strength-wise, but also has the ability to see the blitz occurring and fit where he needs to.""

But the stars of the position can set new benchmarks with their performance and diverse skill set.  For rising stars like Robinson and Gibbs, maybe that's all they need.  ""The top-tier guys are going to have to carry it,"" McCoy said.  Ben Arthur is the AFC South reporter for FOX Sports.

53,Bob Pockrass,Former Cup champion Martin Truex Jr. retiring after 2024 season,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/former-cup-champion-martin-truex-jr-retiring-after-2024-season,"Martin Truex Jr. plans to retire from Cup racing after 2024, capping a career that includes the 2017 Cup championship and 34 Cup wins.",2024-06-13T19:37:36Z,"Martin Truex Jr. plans to retire from Cup racing after the 2024 season, capping a career that includes the 2017 NASCAR Cup Series championship and currently 34 Cup wins. Truex announced the decision to retire from full-time Cup racing Friday at Iowa Speedway while leaving the door open to race select events in NASCAR’s national series. He wouldn’t rule out another Daytona 500 start, as the one main thing still left for him to achieve on his racing résumé is winning the sport’s biggest race.  Truex will continue to serve as an ambassador for Joe Gibbs Racing and mentioned he could run Xfinity races for the team. But his attempts to win a championship will end this year. ""It just felt like the right time for me, honestly,"" Truex said. ""I thought about it a lot the past few seasons and just waited for that feeling in my mind to be positive, that OK, I’m good, I want to do something else. Something just felt different this year for me. ""I felt like it was time to slow down and do something else. It’s been a great ride, though, obviously."" Truex, who turns 44 later this month, has competed full time in Cup racing since 2006 with 32 of his victories coming since 2015. He is winless so far in 2024 but sits fifth in the overall Cup standings in what now will be the final season of a career that should land him in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. The JGR driver has been on a series of one-year deals the past few years and admittedly struggles with the decision each year. JGR wanted an answer now as there are several drivers without contracts for 2025, and JGR didn't want to lose a chance to land a driver while waiting on a Truex decision. Truex said the performance this year didn’t impact his decision. ""We’ve had some disappointments this year for sure, but it’s not enough to make you stop doing what you want to do,"" Truex said. ""Totally not related to performance in any way, shape or form.""  Truex said he made the decision in the last few weeks and that while nervous, he couldn’t describe his emotions. ""I’m not really that emotional,"" Truex said. ""It has not really sunk in yet, honestly. … I’m looking forward to getting into the car."" Current Stewart-Haas Racing driver Chase Briscoe, who became available when SHR announced two weeks ago that it would shut down at the end of the season, is the top candidate to replace Truex. He has one career win in 124 Cup starts and sits 17th in the current Cup standings. He won nine Xfinity Series races in a breakout season in 2020. Truex won back-to-back Xfinity Series titles in 2004-05 for Chance 2 Motorsports (the precursor to JR Motorsports) and went to Cup to drive for Dale Earnhardt Inc., which eventually merged with Chip Ganassi Racing. He had appeared to find a home at Michael Waltrip Racing, but the 2013 race manipulation scandal at Richmond (which Truex was unaware of and had no direct part in) resulted in the team losing sponsorship for Truex. That was a pivotal moment, as Truex joined Furniture Row Racing in 2014 and won a Cup title for the organization in 2017. The team shut down after 2018, and Truex has driven for JGR for the last six years. Truex has 146 top-five finishes in 673 career Cup starts.                                                                             Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

Stu Holden joined Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica and Geoff Schwartz to provide a gambling preview of Euro 2024 and Copa América.",2024-06-13T15:32:31Z,"Bear Bets is back and ready for the summer of stars. FOX Sports' digital gambling show returned this week to discuss the upcoming major soccer tournaments, Euro 2024 and Copa América (which are both on the FOX family of networks). Chris ""The Bear"" Fallica and Geoff Schwartz were joined by FOX Sports soccer analyst Stu Holden to help provide a gambling preview for the upcoming tournaments.   So, without further ado, let's get right into the action.  EURO 2024 Which nation among the heavy favorites (Germany, England, France, Portugal, Belgium) do you think is the least likely to win its group? Holden: England ""If we think about Denmark, they have been pretty good in recent years. Serbia and Slovenia are both a little bit tricky. When the group came out, and people were saying, 'Hey, England this, England that, and it's a pretty easy group for them,' I don't know. I could maybe see them slipping up because they have some injury issues. Defensively, I'm not 100 percent convinced by them."" ""I think they probably [win the group], but they're a team that I just feel they have the potential to blow up."" What are your thoughts on host nation Germany and if it can make a deep run? Holden: I like Germany's value to win the tournament (+550) ""When you think about the players that they have, they did really well in some of the European competitions recently. Bayern Leverkusen were one of the best teams in all of Europe. … A lot of their players are on this squad. Being at home really does have a big impact. There's a bit of pressure and the home fans are always going to be a little bit harder, but the last World Cup Germany hosted, they made it to the semifinal. I think their path to the semifinals is pretty doable."" The Bear: Like the potential for a deep run ""It kind of has that feel like they finally overhauled the squad and maybe this is kind of building for the next World Cup. It would not surprise me to see them make a run to the semis."" What's your favorite last-place finish group bet? Holden: Albania to finish last in Group B (-280) ""I think they're happy to be there. I'm sure when that group was drawn and their coaches sat there in the room, they were like, 'Spain. OK. Croatia. Oh, great. Italy. All right, sweet. Let's go for a vacation.'"" Group D might be the most loaded group of the tournament. Are there any wagers you like involving the teams from that group or any thoughts? The Bear: Netherlands to make it to the quarterfinals (+135) ""I think they'll finish second in the group to France, who they really haven't been able to beat in qualifying. I think they'll get past whoever they draw on that road to 16. It wouldn't surprise me at all if they were able to get one step further than that."" Holden: Watch out for Austria ""Austria is a sneaky team. Austria is well-coached and that could be the potential wrinkle to the Dutch getting to a quarterfinal. I do think Austria will cause [the Netherlands] some problems."" Are there any underdogs you like to make a run? Holden: Croatia and Portugal ""I don't know if I could call Croatia an underdog at this point with the run that they've been on, but yet I still think somehow at every major tournament they're kind of overlooked. ""It feels a little cheap calling [Portugal] an underdog here, but they absolutely ran through qualifying. I still don't write off Cristiano Ronaldo. He had 10 goals in qualifying."" Who do you like for top goalscorer of the tournament? Holden: Kylian Mbappe ""You have to really consider with the Golden Boot who you feel is gonna go far as a team. So, normally, France is a pretty sure bet for a semifinal. That's why I really like Mbappe."" COPA AMERICA 2024 What are your general thoughts on the United States entering the tournament? Holden: Use this tournament to set expectations and goals for 2026 World Cup ""This is really our opportunity to find out just how good we may be or can be or how good we are now, and how much room we have for improvement. We've been rinsing Mexico now consistently for the past couple of years. But the big question has always been, can you beat an England? Can you beat a Germany? Can you beat Brazil? Can you beat Colombia? Can you beat a real team to get to a serious part of a competition, and that's why I'm excited. I don't really want to call this a dress rehearsal. I want to see this U.S. team really try and win this."" The United States makes it to the final if … Holden: Someone can step up and be an elite goalscorer ""The United States will make it to the final if Christian Pulisic is able to play at the level that he played for AC Milan this year, if the Gio Reyna that we've seen with the men's national team continues to play well, and the biggest one of all of these is if we have a goalscorer that steps up and really is a high-level player. That was the big thing missing in Qatar."" Looking at the other nations, do you see any way that Argentina doesn't reach the final? It's at -135 to make the final entering the tournament. Holden: Would lean toward Argentina making the final ""If it's Ecuador against Argentina in the semifinal or Argentina against Mexico, even with what Mexico would have as a home field advantage, I just don't see [Argentina losing]. Lionel Messi and Lautaro Martinez. It's still Rodrigo de Paul and Nico Gonzalez. I mean, they just still have the big guys from the World Cup."" Who would you bet on to win the Golden Boot? Holden: Someone from Brazil ""Vinicius Junior hasn't quite had his big moment in the Brazil shirt and something to think about is that Neymar is not going to be a part of this tournament. He has always been the focal point of the Brazilian attack. If you can get somebody now that's going to step up, whether that's Vinicius or Rodrigo, I think you can get some good value there."" Who would you bet to finish last in their group? Holden: Costa Rica and Bolivia ""Bolivia just played in a friendly last week against Mexico, but it was Mexico's U-23 team and they lost that game. They consistently just get trucked."" What do you think the final will be? Holden: Argentina-Brazil ""Vinnie Junior, Rodrigo, Endrick, even the defense that Brazil is going to roll out some of the best goalkeepers in the world, [should make them tough to beat].""

55,Ben Arthur,Jaguars’ Trevor Lawrence is the latest $50M per year QB. Will he live up to it?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/jaguars-trevor-lawrence-latest-50m-per-year-qb-will-he-live-up-it,The Jaguars have poured resources into building around Trevor Lawrence. Now they're banking on him to earn his place among the elite QBs.,2024-06-14T00:48:06Z,"Big money came to Trevor Lawrence because he was next on the list of top quarterbacks to be paid.  Last offseason was for the likes of Jalen Hurts, Justin Herbert, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson. This offseason has been for Lawrence and Jared Goff. Next on the list are Dak Prescott, Tua Tagovailoa and Jordan Love, all three of whom could also receive their paydays as soon as this summer.  It's the way of the market. You don't have to be a consensus top-five player at your position to get the latest record-setting contract. It's about timing.  Thursday was Lawrence's time. He agreed to terms on a five-year, $275 million extension with the Jacksonville Jaguars that includes $200 million guaranteed and $142 million fully guaranteed, a source confirmed to FOX Sports. At $55 million per year, Lawrence ties Burrow for the highest average annual value in league history. The former Clemson star is under contract through 2030.  Now, can Lawrence live up to the deal?  The No. 1 overall pick in 2021, Lawrence has had flashes of greatness. He had 15 passing touchdowns to just two interceptions in the Jaguars' last eight games of the 2022 season, guiding Jacksonville to a stunning AFC South title and playoff win. He had a passer rating over 100 in seven of his first 12 games that season. But his spurts of poor decision-making and propensity for turnovers can leave league observers shaking their heads. He has a league-leading 60 giveaways since entering the league. Lawrence has yet to put together a full season of consistent, elite play.  The Jaguars have poured resources into building the team around Lawrence, to maximize the potential that made him a generational prospect coming out of Clemson.  This offseason, they lost top receiver Calvin Ridley in free agency and released Zay Jones, but they added veteran Gabe Davis and first-round pick Brian Thomas Jr., who led the FBS in receiving touchdowns last season. They've prioritized continuity on the offensive line — extending left guard Ezra Cleveland, restructuring Brandon Scherff and retaining left tackle Cam Robinson, who was thought to be a cap casualty candidate — to improve the run game. They added an experienced center in Mitch Morse, who has snapped for elite quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. On the defensive side of the ball, they've added the likes of defensive tackle Arik Armstead, safety Darnell Savage and cornerback Ronald Darby.  Overall, the Jaguars have prioritized the integration of playoff-seasoned players to prevent last season's collapse — a 1-5 finish after starting the year 8-3 — from happening again.   These players should not only help shoulder the leadership load with Lawrence (and outside linebacker Josh Allen), but also show him how to do it effectively.  ""He's becoming the vocal leader in the locker room, on the field, in meetings,"" coach Doug Pederson said this offseason of Lawrence's growth. ""He's engaging. When we got him three years ago, he was just learning our system and kind of quiet and just trying to go through the motions a little bit of just trying to adapt to us and get a feel for us. … Now he's giving us suggestions and ideas and really becoming another coach, a set of eyes on the field."" After the 2022 season, Lawrence appeared to be approaching superstardom. But his numbers regressed in most major categories in 2023 — completion rate, passing yards, passing touchdowns, interceptions, passer rating and EPA per dropback among them.  The setback requires context, though.  The Jaguars offense didn't have the same flow last season with offensive coordinator Press Taylor calling plays (Pederson said there's been no decision on who will call plays in 2024). Injuries to the team's top receivers were rampant. An injury-riddled offensive line impacted the rushing attack.  Lawrence had his own health challenges, too. He missed the first game of his career and a substantial amount of practice in the second half of the season. He suffered a concussion and battled shoulder, knee and ankle issues.  But Lawrence is entering Year 4. The inconsistencies must be eliminated.  It's time to finally show that he's worth the money that's now his.  Ben Arthur is the AFC South reporter for FOX Sports.

56,Doug McIntyre,USMNT regains confidence ahead of Copa América: 'We'll be tough to play against',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/usmnt-regains-confidence-ahead-copa-america-we-will-be-tough-play-against,"A 1-1 tie against mighty Brazil helped the USMNT wash away the bad taste of their blowout loss to Colombia, sets a blueprint for success in Copa América.",2024-06-13T14:32:00Z,"ORLANDO, Florida — Under normal circumstances, any team that suffers a spirit-crushing one-sided defeat will settle for nothing less than a face-saving victory in its next match. These were not normal circumstances. Going up against five-time World Cup champ Brazil on Wednesday, just four days after a shameful 5-1 defeat by Colombia in its first of two pre-Copa América warmup games, the U.S. men national team's backs were against the wall. The USMNT came into the contest riding an 11-game losing streak against the all-planet Seleção, its longest run of futility against any nation. The Americans didn't get the win they wanted. But they delivered the needed response nonetheless in a hugely entertaining 1-1 tie that was enough to make Gregg Berhalter's players feel a lot better about themselves and their chances of making a deep run when the prestigious 108-year-old tournament kicks off in cities across the country next week. ""We feel a whole lot better than last game, that's for sure,"" deadpanned U.S. captain Christian Pulisic, who scored the equalizer for the hosts on a first-half free kick that canceled out another unforced error that gave Brazil an early 1-0 lead. ""It's definitely a step in the right direction."" It wasn't a perfect performance, to be sure. There are still plenty of things the U.S. must tighten up before the main event kicks off for the home team on June 23 versus Bolivia in Arlington, Texas (6 p.m. ET on FOX). But the Americans did play their hearts out. That wasn't necessarily the case against Colombia, which, combined with their generally sloppy play, resulted in a rout. ""As bad as the result [against Los Cafeteros] was, we knew we had to get that out of our system before Copa, and that's definitely what we did,"" defender Chris Richards said following Wednesday's draw. ""We know that if we bring that intensity every match, that we'll be tough to play against."" ""I think it was just a willingness to defend, get numbers behind the ball in transition, getting numbers back,"" Pulisic said when asked what the difference was in this one. ""We had our talks as a team for sure. I'm not going to say exactly what went on, but it was time to hold each other accountable. It was time to step up in a big moment, in a big game, and I'm happy with the response of the guys. You can see that the effort was there."" It was. And tying Brazil for the first time in program history is no small thing; 18 of the 19 previous meetings ended with a loss for the U.S., with that lone win coming all the way back in 1998. ""When you play a team like that, they're obviously very, very good and will create chances no matter how well you're playing,"" said veteran center back Tim Ream, who was superb after struggling against the Colombians. The U.S. created plenty of scoring opportunities, too. And with a little more luck, they could've stolen a win. Weston McKennie set Pulisic up for a late golden chance, but Brazil keeper Alisson Becker pawed it away from point-blank range. The hosts needed several big saves from their own backstop. Matt Turner made 11 stops in all, most of them after his off-target pass helped gift Brazil its opener. ""He's a big-time goalie,"" Richards said of Turner. That's why he's our No. 1."" [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox? Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.] Still, it was a total team response after the 19th minute mistake. ""It's easy to get down on yourself once you've gotten scored on, especially early like that,"" Richards said. ""But we knew if we kept the momentum and kept the intensity that we had that we were gonna be able to eventually put one in."" Pulisic's leveler came just nine minutes later. As pleased as the Americans were with their gutsy response, they also weren't popping champagne in the locker room post-game. Turner was quick to put the evening into perspective. ""It's easy to go really big right now and say, 'Wow, it's the best performance,'"" he said. ""We have a few days now to recover and rest, and then it's full-on tournament mode, and small mistakes can't happen anymore. And I think that's probably the biggest message."" It's not the only one, though. ""We have to demand more from each other,"" Turner said. ""We knew that we were going to have to be at our best to have a chance in the game."" If the U.S. wasn't at its best, it was close. It's a result to build on either way. ""The effort gives us a lot of hope going into Copa,"" Pulisic said. ""It gives us a little bit of confidence.""

57,Martin Rogers,Is Euro 2024 the toughest tournament in the world?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/euro-2024-toughest-tournament-world,The incredible depth of the European Championship has left many believing that Europe's continental tournament is even harder to win than the World Cup.,2024-06-13T15:35:50Z,"It seems to make basic sense that the World Cup would be the most difficult tournament to win in international soccer, as it features the best of the best, with no superstar individual or powerhouse nation left out of the party. Yet there has long been a school of thought that the European Championships, on account of their specific nature and format, are just as tough a gauntlet, or — wait, what? — perhaps even more challenging. That thinking was backed up this week by none other than Kylian Mbappé, who made no secret of the fact that he thinks even mighty France will face a brutal challenge over the next month. ""The Euros are complicated,"" Mbappé told reporters, ahead of France's first Group D game against Austria in Dusseldorf next Monday (3 p.m. ET on FOX). ""For me, (it is) more complicated than a World Cup, even if there is more pressure at the World Cup. All the teams, they know each other, we play against each other all the time. Tactically, it is very similar."" Mbappé should know. He won the World Cup at age 19, injecting speed and sparkle to a loaded France team as it surged through the field at the 2018 tournament in Russia. In the winter of 2022, it is impossible to forget, he was magnificent as France came nail-bitingly close to another World Cup, scoring a hat-trick in the final in a penalty shootout defeat to Lionel Messi's Argentina. In the Euros, however, essentially that same France team has struggled of late, losing to Switzerland in the round of 16 last time out to round off a stuttering campaign. Mbappé's comments were backed up by Javier Tebas, president of Spain's La Liga. Spain won the Euros in 2008 and 2012, with a World Cup win sandwiched in between, and Tebas regards the difficulty level of the continental victories with supreme respect. ""The Euros are very difficult to win,"" he said recently. ""I would say even harder than the World Cup."" But why would a tournament featuring just the best of Europe be considered more favorably than the World Cup, which also has Europe's heavyweights, in addition to the strongest teams of South America, most notably Argentina and Brazil, plus the crème of talent from other continents. The key behind the thinking, and this is all based off personal preference obviously, lies in the inherent depth of European soccer. On occasion, the best nations can breeze through a World Cup group, sometimes taking advantage of the inexperience or lower quality of teams from, say, Asia or Africa — though it should be noted the worldwide standard of the game continues to improve at a rapid pace. At the Euros, in most cases, every game is a tough one. Looking at the 24-strong field for this year's event, which begins on Friday with Germany vs. Scotland (3 p.m. ET on FOX), Georgia (world ranked No. 75) is by far the weakest team on paper, and maybe the only one where opposition teams will fancy an easier ride. Eight of the world's top 10 men's soccer nations, according to FIFA, hail from Europe. The continent also boasts 17 of the top 29, including both Wales and Sweden — neither of whom even managed to qualify for the festivities in Germany this summer. When things get going, don't expect much in the way of one-sided games. The last Euros, scheduled for 2020 but delayed until the following year due to COVID, saw eight of the 15 knockout round games go to extra-time.  The most lopsided scoreline ever seen at the Euros is five goals, which has happened on five occasions. The World Cup has witnessed six instances of wins by eight goals or more, with three seven-goal victories coming this century. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox? Create or log in to your FOX Sports account, follow leagues, teams and players to receive a personalized newsletter daily.] ""The Euros is much more balanced,"" Giorgio Chiellini, who was part of the reigning champion Italy squad and will be a FOX analyst for the tournament, told me. ""It is harder because your opponent really knows you and how to play against you. But in one sense, a little easier because you know them.  ""But there no longer exist any ‘bad' teams who arrive at the tournament, maybe just in the qualifiers there might be one or two that are not competitive. And in terms of passion, at the Euros you feel it in every street, everywhere you go, how everyone cares about what happens. It is the same passion as for the World Cup.""  Examples of teams that have found the World Cup easier than the Euros are in plentiful supply. A good one is Croatia, finalist and semifinalist in the last two World Cups and conqueror of Brazil in 2022, but without a single victory in the knockout stage of the Euros. The searing standard all conspires to make Euro 2024 an irresistible carrot for the likes of Mbappé. The star forward, who recently completed a move from Paris St. Germain to Real Madrid, regards the trophy as the main missing piece in the career cabinet. ""I have won the World Cup, I have won the Nations League,"" he said. ""I am missing the Euro."" Martin Rogers is a columnist for FOX Sports.

58,,Netflix reveals 'Receiver' series trailer; 'Quarterback' sequel drops July 10,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/netflix-reveals-receiver-series-trailer-quarterback-sequel-drops-july-10,"Netflix's upcoming documentary ""Receiver"" features NFL stars Justin Jefferson, Davante Adams, Deebo Samuel, Amon-Ra St. Brown and George Kittle.",2024-06-13T18:15:23Z,"Netflix has unveiled the release date and trailer for ""Receiver,"" its sequel to last year's hit sports docuseries ""Quarterback."" The series, produced by Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions, shifts focus from the NFL's signal-callers to some of its elite pass-catchers. Part of that change was seemingly by necessity, as several quarterbacks were reportedly uninterested in being featured in the show's second season. ""Receiver"" will feature five household names, including the Vikings' Justin Jefferson, the Las Vegas Raiders' Davante Adams, the Detroit Lions' Amon-Ra St. Brown and star San Francisco 49ers teammates George Kittle and Deebo Samuel.  Documentary crews followed all five Pro Bowlers throughout the 2023 regular season, both on game days and away from the gridiron during their everyday family lives. Judging by the trailer, moments expected to be included in the series include Jefferson dealing with the hamstring injury that sidelined him for eight weeks as he attempted to defend his 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year title, as well as Samuel's and Kittle's desperation to win a Super Bowl with the star-studded 49ers and Adams navigating the Raiders' midseason coaching change from Josh McDaniels to Antonio Pierce. The first season of ""Quarterback"" featured Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes, who won his second MVP and Super Bowl, along with Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota, then of the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, during the 2022-23 season and postseason.

60,"Deesha Thosar, Rowan Kavner",Best fits for Luis Robert? Yankees dilemma? Red Sox buyers? 5 burning MLB questions,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/best-fits-luis-robert-yankees-dilemma-red-sox-buyers-5-burning-mlb-questions,"The FOX Sports MLB staff offers its takes on the Cubs, Cardinals and Red Sox contending, Seattle surging, Texas and Arizona X-factors, Yankees' Jasson Domínguez, and White Sox trade assets.",2024-06-14T12:00:36Z,"The White Sox are rumored to be shopping arguably the best position player and pitcher on the trade market. The Yankees have a decision to make with top prospect Jasson Domínguez.  The Red Sox are in the thick of the wild-card race. The Mariners have separated themselves in the AL West. Reigning World Series representatives Texas and Arizona have underwhelmed. So have the Cubs and Cardinals.  With all eight teams appearing on FOX channels on Saturday — Cardinals-Cubs at 2:20 p.m. ET on FS1; Rangers-Mariners at 7:15 p.m. ET on FOX; Yankees-Red Sox at 7:15 p.m. ET on FOX; White Sox-Diamondbacks at 10:10 p.m. ET on FS1 — FOX Sports MLB experts Deesha Thosar and Rowan Kavner tackle these topics and more in this week's roundtable. 1. Which of the Cardinals and Cubs is the more legitimate playoff contender? Thosar: The Cardinals. They're hungrier than the Cubs to forget last year's sub-.500 finish, which was the first time the franchise stooped that low since 2007. St. Louis expects playoff baseball every single year, and that kind of pressure from the city and the fan base helps to keep a team focused on contending — no matter what it takes. Plus, there's the Nolan Arenado of it all, a player who only cares about winning, and after 12 years in the majors, he's running out of time to win that elusive championship. With reinforcements expected to come via the trade deadline, the Cards seem like they'll return to October baseball again. Kavner: I'll take the Cubs, mostly because I trust their starting pitching more, but it'll depend on which of these teams decides to buy at the deadline. The Cubs will need help if they're going to make a run. Their hitters rank 19th in OPS. Their bullpen is 24th in ERA. They've had guys in and out of the lineup, but they'll need some guys beyond just Seiya Suzuki, Cody Bellinger and Michael Busch to start hitting. Dansby Swanson has displayed more positive signs at the plate of late, but they could use another impact bat — a catcher or corner infielder, preferably — and some bullpen help. Can I just go off the board and take the Reds instead here? 2. With top Yankees prospect Jasson Domínguez finished with his rehab assignment, what would your approach be with him over these next few months? Thosar: Firstly, I'd weigh the balance of how much his development is actually benefitting from playing at Triple-A. It seems like the disparity between major- and minor-league pitching has never been wider, particularly the difference in velocity, and Domínguez already has experience hitting in the big leagues after playing in eight September games last year — he crushed four home runs in 31 at-bats.  So, unless the Yankees are being extra cautious as he works his way back from Tommy John surgery, they should be finding ways to get him onto the major-league roster around the All-Star break. He can split time in the outfield and at DH, giving Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, and Giancarlo Stanton days to get off their feet and stay fresh for October. It's just hard to believe he wouldn't benefit more from seeing major-league pitching, even if he won't get regular at-bats. Kavner: I think the Yankees are handling it correctly. Domínguez will help them at some point this year, but it might not be until the final playoff push (barring any injuries before then). At 21 years old, he needs to play, and there just aren't many at-bats available for him in the New York outfield the way Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Alex Verdugo are performing. For the next few months, Domínguez just needs to keep doing what he's doing now. The Martian can look at Evan Carter last year as a model for what's possible. Carter didn't get called up until September, but the Rangers wouldn't have won the World Series without him. 3. Should the Red Sox be aggressive at the deadline, or would you be inclined to let the season simply play out if they continue hovering around .500? Thosar: The Red Sox are in a tough spot with their top prospects, in that it would be shocking if they traded away their best three players — shortstop Marcelo Mayer, outfielder Roman Anthony and catcher Kyle Teel, in that order — for reinforcements to the 2024 roster. To even consider parting ways with one player in that trio, the Red Sox would need to be a better team than they have been this season, with a brighter outlook down the stretch. Instead, they're fluttering around .500, with a chance to make it into the postseason via the wild card, and even that dream scenario would require a big push from the club between now and late July.  At the same time, it's important for new chief baseball officer Craig Breslow to use the trade deadline as an opportunity to make his mark on the future of the organization. So, while it seems unlikely that Breslow will just stand pat, it's hard for me to believe the Red Sox will be aggressive, as they'd plausibly have to give up one of those three prospects. I think their best course of action would be to try to improve for now and the future, without giving up too much — in other words, every executive's dream. Kavner: I'd let it play out, which I know is probably not what Red Sox fans want to hear after this offseason's frustrating inaction. That was the time to go do something more substantial. At this point, the Yankees and Orioles have already separated in the division, and as much as Boston's pitching has outpaced expectations, the club still finds itself right about where everyone would have thought. Let's see what the offense can do when Wilyer Abreu and Triston Casas are back. Maybe top prospect Marcelo Mayer will get his chance before season's end, and maybe the Red Sox sneak into a wild-card spot. But this doesn't feel like the year to invest too heavily given the current circumstances within their division and with their injuries (the Trevor Story one was the real backbreaker). Conversely, I do wonder with Liam Hendriks possibly returning later this year if the Red Sox might make rentals Kenley Jansen or Chris Martin available. Let's see if something changes over the next month, but at this rate I'd be more surprised if they go all-in than if they do some light selling. 4. The Rangers and Diamondbacks have both disappointed thus far after last year's World Series meeting. Which team is better positioned to get back to the playoffs, and what is each club's biggest X-factor? Kavner: The D-backs should have an easier time sneaking into a wild-card spot given the unsightliness that is the National League right now, but I'm going to take the Rangers here just because of the arms they should get back and the fact that I don't think their offense can be this putrid all season. It felt like they just had to stay afloat long enough for Max Scherzer, Jacob deGrom and Tyler Mahle to return, and they've (sort of) done that, although the Mariners have begun to separate. The oddest part is that the Rangers' rotation has been the least of their concerns. They have a 4.71 bullpen ERA while the offense, which was one of baseball's best last year, hasn't produced. Getting Josh Jung back should be a huge boost, but because of the offensive mediocrity, I'll say the X-factor for them is the development (and health) of rookies Evan Carter and Wyatt Langford. It's been a rough go for both so far, but I have a hard time thinking Langford's only home run this year will be his inside-the-parker. Now, if I were to have told you one of these two teams was going to have serious pitching issues the first half of the year, your answer probably wouldn't have been the D-backs. They employ Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly, Brandon Pfaadt took major strides late last year, and they signed Eduardo Rodríguez and Jordan Montgomery in the offseason to try to build on last year's success. But here we are near the halfway mark, and only three teams have a worse starters ERA than Arizona. Gallen, Kelly and Rodríguez are hurt, so the X-factor for me is the health of their starting pitching. Thosar: The Rangers. Though they're half a dozen games behind the Mariners for the division lead, they're only two games under .500 and right in the mix for the AL wild card. Following them up close during their run to the World Series last year, this is not a club that panics easily, if at all, under Bruce Bochy. And with Max Scherzer and other injured pitchers coming back, they can help stabilize the club before the trade deadline. It might sound odd to call the reigning ALCS MVP an X-factor, but Adolis García (87 wRC+) needs to get it going for the rest of the Rangers lineup to look like a formidable unit again. Same goes for the D-backs, because Corbin Carroll, the reigning NL Rookie of the Year, is so electric when he's on that he can change the dynamic of the team in the way that only true X-factors can. 5. The Mariners currently have a commanding lead in the AL West. Are you buying them as one of the best teams in the league? Thosar: If the Mariners are selling it, I'm buying it. They deserve credit for capitalizing on the rest of the mediocre division, which no one could've predicted a few months ago. But with the Rangers and Astros more than a handful of games behind them, now is the perfect time for Seattle to continue broadening that gap and leave no doubt about the club's intentions this season.  The Mariners are reaping the rewards of their strong pitching staff, but the offense (.667 OPS, 24th in MLB) will need to start picking up the slack for a real shot at a deep playoff race. If the pitching can keep it up, and Julio Rodríguez puts up another strong second half, then they're right up there in the AL — though perhaps in Tier 2 with the Guardians and Royals — after the Yankees and Orioles, anyway. Kavner: They're not better than the Orioles or Yankees, but I'll buy them as part of that next tier. Having elite starting pitching is a wonderful luxury and should keep them among the most formidable teams in baseball all year. They're 40-30 and haven't even had the inevitable ""Julio Rodríguez looks like the best player on the planet again"" month that is bound to happen at some point in the second half. Bonus: What teams would you like to see make godfather offers for the White Sox's Luis Robert Jr. and Garrett Crochet? Kavner: For Robert, I'll take the Phillies. Robert is under contract through 2027 (club options in 2026 and '27) and is Chicago's most dynamic position player, so if general manager Chris Getz doesn't get the offer he's looking for, he can just wait until the offseason. But Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski might be the guy to do it. I can't imagine there will be too many years in which his Phillies hold a nearly double-digit lead in the division on the Braves in mid-June; why not really go for it and bolster the one position on the field that could use a little more punch? For Crochet, I'd like to see the Brewers do it. It's amazing they have such a comfortable lead in the NL Central after dealing away Corbin Burnes, but that rotation could use at least one more elite arm to feel confident in October. Now, who will actually do it? I just assume Padres GM A.J. Preller will find a way. Thosar: I'd love to see the Orioles go for it by trading for Robert. It's a move they wouldn't normally make, but under new ownership could be the type of trade-deadline splash that sets a new standard. As for Crochet, there should be many, many suitors for the hard-throwing left-hander. But it would be exciting if the Braves, known to make eyebrow-raising summer deals, go for him this year, particularly after losing Spencer Strider and Ronald Acuña Jr. to injury, as a way to announce that they're not out of this thing just yet.

61,Sam Panayotovich,2024 MLB odds: 'Yankees-Dodgers World Series would be a real needle mover',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/2024-mlb-odds-yankees-dodgers-world-series-would-real-needle-mover,The Dodgers and Yankees are both off to hot starts this season. Is a World Series matchup in the cards? Sammy P spoke to a bookmaker to see what the betting market thinks of the possibility.,2024-06-14T19:41:05Z,"It’s been 43 years since the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees met in the MLB World Series. Republican president Ronald Reagan operated inside the Oval Office, the average price of gasoline was $1.35 and ""Endless Love"" by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie sat atop the Billboard charts. My, how things have changed. The present-day editions of the two baseball superpowers are destroying nearly everything in sight. Los Angeles (42-28) already holds a six-game lead in the NL West and New York (50-22) is on pace for 103 victories. They’re both heavy favorites to win their respective leagues and if the betting math wins out, the Dodgers and Yankees will collide on baseball’s biggest stage for the record-breaking twelfth time in Major League history. Sign me up. ""That would be a big improvement from last year’s World Series,"" Circa Sports sportsbook director Chris Bennett told FOX Sports. ""The Diamondbacks were such a dud in terms of bringing excitement. If we can have Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts in the World Series, we’ll be stoked."" ""It should be a net positive, too, although so much of the betting handle comes down to the individual games and what people believe from an opinion perspective. You can have two great teams and two superstar pitchers, but not much betting interest because people can’t find a bet to make. It’s hard to predict the handle for a hypothetical best-of-seven series. ""That said, a Yankees-Dodgers series would be a real needle mover for player props. That’s where interest would climb. You’ve got three superstar players in each lineup, and we would look to post as many props as possible."" RELATED: 2024 World Series odds, Dodgers remain big favorites I try not to get too far ahead of myself when writing stories like this, but big brands sell in sports. It’s why we flip on the television in mid-June and talking heads are analyzing the Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas Cowboys. Annoying as it might be, it’s just the way it is. If you’re looking for non-household names, look no further than the Yankees’ starting pitchers. Gerrit Cole hasn’t thrown a pitch this season and New York’s rotation boasts a collective 2.84 ERA, best in baseball.   Luis Gil (2.04), Clarke Schmidt (2.52) and Carlos Rodón (2.93) all have ERAs under three and the Yankees are 30-8 when that trio takes the mound. Sheesh. ""Two things stick out about the Yankees,"" Bennett said. ""The lineup and bullpen aren’t a surprise, but Luis Gil and Clarke Schmidt are. Those guys have been absolutely dominant this season, and they were both projected to be backend starters at best during Spring Training. ""Nobody is pitching better [than Gil] right now."" Bennett’s shop is already down to +225 [$10 wins $22.50] on the Yankees to win the American League, an extremely respectful price this early in the season. Then there’s the Dodger number. Circa plowed Los Angeles through the 2-1 benchmark to its current odds at +175 [$10 wins $17.50] to reach the World Series.   That was Tiger Woods’ price at golf majors in his prime. ""If you don’t win your division, you play that extra series and the path gets tougher,"" Bennett explained. ""The Dodgers are a massive favorite to come out of the NL West, while the Yankees have a small division lead over the Orioles. That’s why we’re shorter on the Dodgers to make the World Series. ""We did take a Yankees’ World Series bet at 9-1 a while back, though. We never felt we were dealing a number that was too high. I moved off that 9-1 price and have moved down further since the Yankees are in good position to be the No. 1 seed. We’re currently at +550, and we’re in a good spot."" Circa doesn’t let you parlay futures, but if you plugged their pennant prices into a parlay calculator, a Dodgers-Yankees World Series would pay +794. You might think that’s a rip-off, but DraftKings and FanDuel — books that allow you to parlay futures — are offering +712 and +544, respectively. Moreover, that hypothetical parlay with Circa’s odds (+794) implies around a rather-slim 11 percent chance the Dodgers and Yankees both reach the Fall Classic. ""Even though I’m in the business of oddsmaking and knowing prices, I don’t think of anything in terms of a percentage,"" Bennett said. ""I think about what a team’s pennant odds should be and their probabilities to be a one or two seed. Then they must win two series, so you calculate that probability. ""It seems like there’s a pretty good chance both the Dodgers and Yankees will be a one or two seed in their respective leagues and be favored in each playoff series. So if that works out to 11 percent, so be it."" I usually throw Bennett a curveball at the end of our chats because it’s always fun to wind him up and let him go on the baseball betting topic du jour. I know Dodgers and Yankees futures don’t phase him, but other things do. Naturally, his main enigma this year didn’t disappoint. ""Mine’s easy because I just dealt with all the market moves [Thursday],"" Bennett admitted. ""It’s Garrett Crochet for the White Sox. You look at his last nine starts, and he’s right there with Luis Gil for best pitcher in baseball. ""Yes, the White Sox keep losing games, but they’ve been more competitive lately. They’ve blown a bunch of late leads over the last month and lost. So that dynamic of pricing a superstar pitcher on a bad team with a bad bullpen makes for interesting betting markets. ""You’ll notice the White Sox first-five inning price is much different than the full game price when Crochet pitches because of his dominance. These are the things that keep me going during such a long season."" Sam Panayotovich is a sports betting analyst for FOX Sports and NESN. He previously worked for WGN Radio, NBC Sports and VSiN.

You can partake in the best of both worlds while watching the UFL championship this weekend with our free-to-play FOX Super 6 game. How do you play? Enter the UFL Super 6 contest by predicting the correct answers to six questions before the games start for your chance at weekly cash prizes.  All you have to do is finish in the top six to win a prize. It really is that simple, and again, it's free. And if you need a little help before heading to the app to make your picks, I have you covered this week. Read below for my thoughts on UFL Championship weekend, which can be seen on FOX and the FOX Sports app. Let's dive into the questions and predictions below. 1. Which team will throw for the most PASSING YARDS? Birmingham Stallions or San Antonio Brahmas  Even with the Stallions' questionable quarterback rotation right now, I have to think they will throw for more yards. They have a better passing attack and may need to throw the ball more if the Brahmas continue pressuring with their good defense.  Prediction: Birmingham Stallions 2. Order the following by who will have the most RECEIVING YARDS from highest to lowest: Deon Cain, Justin Smith, Jace Sternberger, Jontre Kirklin Jace Sternberger has only 25 catches this season but leads the Stallions in receiving yards. He’s averaging 18.2 yards per reception. He's an excellent tight end weapon and would be nearly unguardable in any league. Prediction: Jace Sternberg, Jontre Kirklin, Deon Cain, Justin Smith  3. Will the TOTAL SCORE of the Championship game be OVER or UNDER 41.5 points? Over or Under We've got ourselves a matchup between two teams with excellent scoring defenses and then there's this Brahmas team that’s allowed just under 13 points against the top three offenses in the league. San Antonio's offense struggles to score and the Stallions defense is good enough to make it tough on them.  Prediction: Under 4. Order the following by who will have the most RUSHING YARDS from highest to lowest: Anthony McFarland, C.J. Marable, Ricky Person Jr., John Lovett This one is tough because these teams rotate running backs, so this is a matter of trying to pick the hot hand. The hottest hand has been Anthony McFarland, who rushed for over 100 yards last weekend against the Battlehawks. Prediction: Anthony McFarland, Ricky Person Jr, John Lovett, C.J. Marable 5. Which player will have the most SACKS? Carlos Davis, Wyatt Ray, Dondrea Tillman, No sacks by these players Carlos Davis leads the league in sacks with seven in nine games, so he’s the best bet to get a sack in this game.  Prediction: Carlos Davis6. What will be the outcome of the Championship game? Birmingham Stallions win by 3 points or more OR San Antonio Brahmas win, or lose by 2 points or fewer Prediction: San Antonio Brahmas lose by 2 points or fewer Tiebreaker — What will be the final score? 20-19 Prediction: Birmingham 20, San Antonio 19  Geoff Schwartz is an NFL analyst for FOX Sports.

63,Ric Bucher,Did Mavs unlock something in Game 4 rout of Celtics?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/did-mavericks-unlock-something-game-4-rout-celtics,"Dallas stayed alive in the NBA Finals with a 38-point thumping on Boston in Game 4, but did the Celtics simply take their foot off the gas?",2024-06-15T03:50:01Z,"So maybe Game 3 wasn’t a total loss, after all. The Dallas Mavericks, playing Game 4 from the start with the urgency and pace that fueled an ultimately futile 20-2 fourth-quarter run in Game 3, exorcised a lot of frustration and earned themselves a return trip to Boston with a resounding 122-84 win, reducing the Celtics’ best-of-seven series lead to 3-1. Game 5 will be Monday in TD Garden. The win also saved the Mavericks from the ignominy of being the first Western Conference team to get swept in the NBA Finals since the Detroit Pistons put a fork in the post-Kareem Abdul Jabbar Los Angeles Lakers in 1989. After fouling out with more than four minutes to play in Game 3 and that 20-2 burst having shrunk a 21-point Boston lead to 93-90 in less than seven minutes, Luka Dončić focused on finding his teammates and the basket rather than fault with the officials. The result: 29 points and his best assist/turnover ratio so far, with five dimes and only one turnover. Kyrie Irving was equally balanced and efficient as a scorer and playmaker, with 21 points, six assists and only one turnover. Their largesse resulted in a host of other Mavericks contributing points. Five finished in double figures and — in part because of the lengthy garbage time — 13 made the scoring column. Someone also apparently reminded the Mavericks that without center Kristaps Porzingis — who was listed as available but did not play because of his left leg injury — the Celtics are height-challenged. Dallas took full advantage of that, crushing Boston on the boards, 65-39, and points in the paint, 60-26. After seeing his team unable to cut into a 26-point halftime deficit, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla set an unofficial record for earliest outcomes conceded, inserting his end-of-the-bench brigade with more than three minutes left in the third quarter and Dallas leading, 88-52. Did the Mavericks discover something or was this simply a combination of a prideful team playing on its home floor against an opponent letting its foot off the proverbial gas pedal?

64,Michael Cohen,"'One, two, three, stay': Inside Dan Hurley's choice to pass on 'once-in-a-lifetime' job",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/one-two-three-stay-inside-dan-hurleys-choice-pass-once-in-a-lifetime-job,"With the most significant decision of his professional career weighing on him, UConn coach Dan Hurley engaged in a thought experiment with his wife, which ultimately led him to his answer.",2024-06-14T18:32:33Z,"STORRS, Conn. — A night before finalizing the most significant choice of his career, Dan Hurley, who was weighing a massive contract extension from Connecticut against the ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to lead the Los Angeles Lakers, engaged in a 21st-century thought experiment with his wife. He and Andrea Hurley, to whom he's been married for more than two decades, agreed to text each other simultaneously, on the count of three, with either the word ""go"" or the word ""stay"" in reference to the quandary their family faced.  ""One, two, three, send it,"" Hurley recalled during a media session on Thursday afternoon, his first since being catapulted into the news cycle last week. ""And we both got it. And it was both ‘stay.' I said, ‘Let's do the same thing in the morning.'"" Their answers matched again the following morning, and then a third time later that afternoon when Hurley cast a furtive glance in Andrea's direction before leaving their home in Glastonbury, Connecticut. ""Just kind of looked at each other like, ‘Do you feel good about this?' Hurley said. Because by then, the only thing separating Hurley from a scheduled and rescheduled meeting with his players, his assistants and his support staff — all of whom were still in the dark about what he planned to do — was a 25-mile drive to campus. Hurley called UConn's athletic director, David Benedict, and informed him of the decision to stay and chase a third consecutive national championship. Hurley's agent, Bret Just, explained to the Lakers that his client was declining the six-year, $70 million contract they'd offered. From there, word of Hurley's choice rattled across social media platforms and reverberated off the walls of the Werth Family Champions Center in Storrs. As he entered the Huskies' locker room, where nobody had a cell phone, the only people who didn't know what Hurley had decided were his players.  ""I used it to my advantage as a coach in terms of asking them for a heavy commitment,"" Hurley said. ""I had made my decision before I went in there, but I kinda demanded a commitment of excellence from them in there, and they didn't really know what I was doing when I went in. So it was almost like, ‘Whatever you guys say and commit to is going to be the deciding factor,' which was a lie. I already had decided.  ""That's why I like coaching guys this age. They're dumber than NBA players. I wouldn't have been able to pull that stuff off [in the pros]. But I got a great commitment from the group and I told them."" His motivational tactic proved to be the final twist in a high-stakes melodrama that captivated and consternated for nearly 96 hours, ever since ESPN first reported that Hurley — and not former Duke star JJ Reddick — had emerged as the focal point of the Lakers' coaching search to replace Darvin Ham. It was the kind of scoop that sent shockwaves through every level of the sport: from the high school prospects Connecticut had been recruiting to the highly talented roster Hurley assembled for the 2024-25 campaign, from the glitziest of NBA franchises to the inescapable orbit of LeBron James and his draft-eligible son, Bronny James.  Barely two months had passed since Hurley laughed away a question about his willingness to entertain new coaching opportunities, namely Kentucky, in the immediate aftermath of winning a second straight title. ""I don't think that's a concern,"" Hurley said with a championship hat draped backward on his head and the trophy beside his right shoulder. But this was the Lakers and their 17 banners calling. This was Hollywood and the chance to coach James, arguably the second-best player of all time behind Michael Jordan. And Hurley, who'd never hidden his interest in plying his trade at that level, knew it was an opportunity worth considering.  Hurley said he was made aware of the Lakers' interest in him on Monday, June 3, which ignited what he described as a subpar week of coaching with his mind racing in numerous directions. Andrea Hurley reacted first with anger and then with tears when Hurley shared the news. Just like her husband, she'd come to adore the life they'd built in Connecticut, a state that was close enough to family and friends in their native New Jersey, and the life they'd built at UConn, where a basketball-centric athletic department boasts all the resources to compete for championships.  Professionally, the Hurleys have always been climbers: from St. Benedict's Prep to Wagner to Rhode Island to UConn. But personally, they'd never been more fulfilled than in their six years with the Huskies.  ""She wasn't happy about [the Lakers' interest] because we all love it here,"" Hurley said. ""And I mean, when you love it and you're so happy, you don't want that type of disruption, especially one that's special, like the Lakers. If it was a lesser opportunity, she wouldn't have reacted so emotionally. And then we handled it like adults. She considered it and weighed it and took the trip and factored in all the things that matter to us."" Their list of factors was equal parts comprehensive and exhaustive: the impact that moving across the country would have on the family, including Hurley's parents, Bob and Christine, both of whom are mainstays at UConn's games; the differences between coaching in college and the NBA; the ever-changing financial landscape of collegiate athletics, especially as it relates to revenue sharing and NIL for a school residing outside the Power 4 conferences; the contractual offers from both the Lakers and Connecticut, whose governor, Ned Lamont, has vowed to make Hurley the highest-paid coach in the country; the loyalty Hurley has always showed to rosters he builds and coaches.  When Hurley finally told his players that he would be traveling to Los Angeles for an interview, a sea of uneasy facial expressions stared back at him. Most of them, if not all, were keenly aware of Hurley's desire to coach in the NBA, but none of them expected to face the reality so quickly — not with such a loaded roster for the 2024-25 season and with so much discussion about the sport's first three-peat since UCLA in the early '70s. ""Images of things that will always be embedded in your mind,"" Hurley said when describing the team's reaction. He and his wife boarded a flight to California the next day. ""Obviously, the Lakers organization is incredible,"" Hurley said. ""You know, once-in-a-lifetime [chance] to be presented with an opportunity to lead one of the most storied franchises in sports. Get a chance to get to know some amazing people in [general manager] Rob Pelinka and [controlling owner] Jeanie Buss."" Then came several days of deliberation as Hurley burned a hole in his rolodex. He sought the input of UConn assistants Kimani Young and Luke Murray, at least one of whom would have joined Hurley in the NBA. He checked in with Benedict about the trajectory of Connecticut's athletic department and fundraising. He reached out to former Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg, one of Hurley's closest mentors. He spoke with fellow coaches Billy Donovan (Chicago Bulls), Tom Izzo (Michigan State) and Quin Synder (Atlanta Hawks). He picked the brain of Brad Stevens (president of the Boston Celtics). He touched base with his parents and his brother, Bobby Hurley, the head coach at Arizona State. He even had some communication with James, the 39-year-old Lakers' megastar and four-time league MVP.  A foray into New York for the Billy Joel concert at Madison Square Garden bifurcated the weekend, with Hurley and his wife joined by Murray, who'd procured some excellent seats and caused a stir by sharing a video of the group on social media. The evening was designed as something of a consolation prize after Hurley had skipped seeing Joel at Fenway Park last September to host No. 1 prospect Cooper Flagg on an official visit. ""It was worth it to have a shot at the Flagg family,"" Hurley said. ""But we couldn't miss a second concert because of basketball issues."" Only this time, the East Coast-centric lyrics in Joel's catalogue were messing with Hurley's mind as the final decision loomed. ""The songs were crazy,"" Hurley said. By the following morning, Hurley knew which way he was leaning. And that's when he called current UConn power forward Alex Karaban, the original centerpiece of Hurley's offensive revolution and a player who pulled out of the NBA Draft to return for a third season. If there was any player on Connecticut's roster to whom Hurley felt particularly conflicted about deserting, it was Karaban, the only player he called before announcing his decision.   ""He was kind of gathering my thoughts about how I felt about him considering [the offer] and how the team was feeling,"" Karaban said. ""Really just trying to make sure the team had a good headspace right now because we did have a lot of distractions leading up. Me, I was a distraction [with the NBA pre-draft process]. Coach [Hurley] was a little bit of a distraction, too. So he wanted to make sure that the team itself was in a good headspace.  ""Then we just had a good conversation and I just told him, ‘I'm happy that you're considering it, everyone is happy that you're considering it, we wanted you to consider it because we know it's your dream.' And he considered it and did what was best for him. And we're just all super happy he's back."" What proved best for Hurley was to stick with the job he adores in the state that adores him back. He can remain at UConn for as long as he'd like with total control over his program — a luxury he never would have had in Los Angeles. The expectation is that a significant contract extension could be finalized quite soon, Hurley said, after the initial outline for his compensation was agreed upon two weeks ago.   The NBA will always be there for Hurley should he ever change his mind. But for now, after back-to-back championships and with a legitimate chance to chase a third, there was no reason for him and his family to mess with what makes them happy.  One, two, three, stay. ""In the end, you love UConn,"" Hurley said. ""You just love UConn."" Michael Cohen covers college football and basketball for FOX Sports with an emphasis on the Big Ten.

The pop music icon and girlfriend of Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce watched some of the ceremony via Instagram live streams shared by players and their significant others. Swift made her presence known while viewing the live broadcast of Chariah Gordon, the girlfriend of Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman, by leaving several comments and emojis. ""JOINING THE PARTY FROM LIVERPOOL LETS GOOOOOOOO,"" Swift wrote with the Union Jack flag in the first of several comments. Swift, who's currently on the European leg of The Eras Tour, posted after performing in her first of three concerts at Liverpool's Anfield Stadium on Thursday. Swift showed her excitement during the festivities with comments such as, ""YESSSSSSS,"" ""CONGRATULATIONS"" and ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH."" She also dropped the heart eyes emoji when the rings were revealed. Swift also expressed her appreciation for Hardman, who caught the game-winning touchdown in the Chiefs' overtime win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. ""AND WE GET ANOTHER YEAR OF MECOLE,"" she commented.  The ceremony went well into the night in Kansas City, meaning that Swift wasn't able to stick around for the entire thing. ""Gotta go to sleep it's so late here love you guys,"" Swift, who was six hours ahead in Liverpool, wrote in her final comment. Kelce attended the ring ceremony event alone, rocking an all-red suit. Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, shared their appreciation for the singer ahead of the event, telling E! News that they're ""big Taylor Swift fans."" ""We like having that visibility,"" Mahomes added on the extra attention the Chiefs got after Kelce's relationship became public. ""At the end of the day, football has always been this bruising sport. We want to make it fun, where kids grow up and play football and show their personality and be who they are."" ""I love it,"" Brittany Mahomes added. ""I love that it's getting young girls into football so that they can watch it with their dad."" Swift has largely been by Kelce's side ever since their relationship went public in September. She attended 13 total games, including all four playoff games. She even flew from Tokyo to attend Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.  Patrick Mahomes and Kelce appeared to be sitting side-by-side during the ring ceremony, with the quarterback sharing a picture the two of them took together after they received their rings. "
66,,"'Chucky Mania' hits San Diego, Hirving Lozano motivated to win MLS titles",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/chucky-mania-hits-san-diego-hirving-lozano-motivated-win-mls-titles,Mexican soccer star Hirving “Chucky” Lozano said he'd like to do something that's atypical in San Diego — win championships.,2024-06-14T21:25:09Z,"On a typically brilliant San Diego day, Mexican soccer star Hirving ""Chucky"" Lozano said he'd like to do something that's generally atypical around here — win championships. Lozano was introduced Thursday as the first designated player of the Major League Soccer expansion team San Diego FC, which will begin play next season. With San Diego bordering the winger's native Mexico, the signing is expected to be popular among the region's soccer fans. A packed news conference in a lounge at Snapdragon Stadium was the first stop of the day for Lozano and his family. The club was hosting a ""Chucky Mania"" public introduction Thursday evening that was expected to draw up to 10,000 fans at a concert shell on San Diego Bay. ""I want to win championships to San Diego and leave my mark to this league,"" Lozano said in opening remarks delivered in English. Following a lengthy news conference that was conducted in Spanish, the 28-year-old from Mexico City went outside and stepped onto his new pitch and posed with team officials for a few dozen photographers and videographers. ""It's a very nice stadium, a very nice pitch,"" Lozano said in English while wearing a San Diego FC scarf and holding a soccer ball.  The dearth of championships by San Diego teams came up a few times. Lozano has won titles with every club he has been on.  ""My objective is to work hard and give my all for San Diego, and we'll work hard to give San Diego championships and titles,"" he said through an interpreter. ""I think we're going to be a great, great team in MLS. I think the base is there, and I'm sure we'll be doing great."" San Diego FC announced last week that Lozano signed a four-year deal through the 2028 season. San Diego FC will become the league's 30th team. Lozano will remain with his current club, PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands, through this year. He’ll be formally transferred to San Diego on Jan. 1. Asked about Lozano's penchant for winning, San Diego FC CEO Tom Penn joked: ""We don't have a trophy case yet. We've got to build one. I forgot. ""He can't do it alone,"" Penn added. ""I think he's a clear signal to the market that that's what we're after. When you make a signing like this, you expect him to be a very elite player in the league, and you expect to then invest beyond just in him in a roster that's worthy of his talent and is worthy of this stadium and is worthy of this market."" Lozano, a product of the academy system of Pachuca in Liga MX, said one of the reasons he signed with SDFC is because he was impressed with its Right To Dream residential academy being built on the Sycuan Reservation in suburban El Cajon. SDFC’s first team will also train at the facility. Lozano became emotional and wiped away tears while speaking about Enrique Meza, the former Pachuca and Mexico national coach who attended the news conference. Meza gave Lozano his professional start when he was 18. ""There were questions at the beginning about, with our affiliation with Right To Dream, were we going to be all about player development, were we going to have to wait seven years to be great?"" Penn said. ""This clearly says, no, we're about winning now and having player development."" PSV recently secured its 25th overall title in the top Dutch league. Lozano had six goals and three assists in 24 matches during the 2023-24 season. Lozano has also won championships with Pachuca in Liga MX and Italian top-tier club Napoli. He has 18 goals in 70 appearances with the Mexican national team and played in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He was more recently left off Mexico’s Copa América squad, along with veterans Guillermo Ochoa and Raul Jimenez, as well as striker Henry Martin. SDFC is owned by Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Mansour and the Sycuan Tribe, the first Native American tribe to have an ownership stake in a professional soccer team. The ownership group also includes San Diego Padres star third baseman Manny Machado. Machado posted a video greeting Lozano on Instagram a few days ago. ""We're looking forward to you raising many trophies like you have all over the world and to come and raise one here in San Diego,"" Machado said. Reporting by The Associated Press."
67,Martin Rogers,Euro 2024: Host Germany thrashes Scotland for dream start to tournament,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/euro-2024-host-germany-thrashes-scotland-in-dream-start-tournament,Jamal Musiala and Germany's young stars spearheaded a 5-1 rout of Scotland to kick off Euro 2024.,2024-06-14T21:18:27Z,"Germany's collection of emerging stars gave their country a dream start to Euro 2024, with Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz spearheading a 5-1 demolition of Scotland in the tournament opener in Munich. Despite mixed performances over the past year, the host nation sent out a clear warning to their rivals, surging into an early lead and never looking back to move immediately into the top spot in Group A. Wirtz, the German Bundesliga player of the year thanks to his magnificent season for undefeated champion Bayer Leverkusen, kept a cool head to deliver the first after only 10 minutes. Collecting the ball on the edge of the area, Wirtz fired hard and low, and goalkeeper Angus Gunn could only parry in onto the post and in. Musiala, also just 21 and coming off a big season for Bayern Munich, lashed home the second on 19 minutes. Kai Havertz selflessly slid the ball into his path, Musiala took two neat touches to freeze his defender, and easily beat Gunn. Scotland's already difficult plight became essentially impossible before halftime. Ryan Porteous's crude two-footed challenge connected above Ilkay Gundogan's ankle and video referral resulted in both a red card and a penalty, which was comfortably slotted home by Havertz. After the break, Scotland mostly went into damage control mode, hoping to avoid an even more lopsided scoreline going into games against Switzerland and Hungary next week. Germany head coach Julian Nagelsmann had the luxury of resting some key players and made use of his bench. As Musiala came off, having engineered so much of Germany's attacking threat throughout, teammate Antonio Rudiger walked over and raised the youngster's hands in appreciation. One of the subs was Niclas Fullkrug, and he made a quick impact, a thunderous shot hitting the net midway through the second half to make it four. Fullkrug had another ruled out for offside as things threatened to become embarrassing for the Scots, who'd enjoyed such uplifting success in qualifying, including a home victory over Spain. A late own goal by Rudiger made little difference to the tone of opening night and Emre Can restored the four-goal margin with a strike from the edge of the box in injury-time, to record Germany's biggest win in Euros history. Nagelsmann's squad could not have asked for a better start, and elicited some memories of the 2006 World Cup, which Germany also hosted and rode the wave of a big opening game victory over Costa Rica to spark a run to the semifinals. One thing became very clear from this night, however. For all the experience in the Germany squad, with Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller and Manuel Neuer still heavily involved, it is the young brigade led by Musiala and Wirtz that holds the keys to its continued success.

68,Bob Pockrass,FOX Sports CEO on full IndyCar slate on FOX: ’Great halo effect for all motorsports',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/fox-sports-ceo-indycar-fox-great-halo-effect-all-motorsports,"With 19 IndyCar windows joining the 14 NASCAR races on FOX Sports starting in 2025, Eric Shanks sees a bright future for motorsports.",2024-06-13T16:20:19Z,"When the NTT IndyCar Series races next season, it should be easy to find. While other sports properties have preferred to have a mix of partners and platforms, the 17 races of the 2025 season will all be on FOX. That includes the Indianapolis 500, which has been telecast by NBC for the last 16 years. The 17 races roll over 16 weekends (there is a doubleheader weekend at Iowa) and with both Indy 500 qualifying days on FOX, that makes 19 windows on network television for the open-wheel racing series. IndyCar CEO Mark Miles said the ability to have the entire season on network made the difference to move from NBC (which currently splits the IndyCar package among NBC, USA and Peacock) to FOX.  [Related: Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden 1-on-1: 'The final pass was like hold your breath']  ""Strategically, ... 19 windows is compelling,"" Miles said. ""For us to cut that in a third or in half, it just doesn't make any sense. We love that fans will know where to go. We love that there's a great deal of consistency. And we think this maximizes the audience. ""I don't know if I’d think about it differently if we had two or three times the number of races. But for what we have, as the IndyCar Series, to us to have one powerful, committed partner will maximize our fan base and our audience."" The races also would be available to those who can stream on the FOX Sports App. ""One of our mantras at FOX Sports is simple wins,"" FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks said. ""And it's just a fact that the biggest events and the broadest audiences are on broadcast television. FOX is distributed not only over the air but also on every streaming platform that’s out there. ""So we're reaching audiences no matter demographic, no matter age."" FOX Sports also has the first 14 events (12 points races, the Clash and the all-star race) of the NASCAR schedule, which will have five races on FOX and nine on FS1. The remaining 24 Cup events will be split among four other broadcasters (Amazon Prime Video has five races, TNT has five races, NBC has four races and USA has 10). Shanks said he spoke Wednesday to NASCAR Chairman Jim France about the IndyCar deal. ""There's going to be a great halo effect for all motorsports,"" Shanks said. ""Once you start to put the two schedules together — both Indy and NASCAR — there's going to be a great halo effect of motorsports because a lot of times they're going to be leading in and out of each other. ""And so the FOX network is not going to be starting from scratch. When we do NASCAR races, you're already going to have a motorsports audience for some of the lead-ins to NASCAR races. And I think that circulation and promotion is going to fit both series. Definitely."" As far as the exact lead-ins, start times for the 2025 IndyCar Series races were not announced and NASCAR has not announced its 2025 schedule. It should release its Cup schedule by the end of the month.  ""Recently we announced that we're going to put sports on Friday nights on the broadcast network, so that allowed us to move some UFL football games off the network from the weekend on to Friday night, so you'll see UFL on Friday night, which freed up some windows as well,"" Shanks said. ""There was a lot of moving pieces to make this a reality. Strategically, we'll continue to work with Indy on start times and windows to maximize the potential audience."" Among other details of the announcement: --The length of the deal was not announced. It is a multiyear deal. Miles would not comment on whether IndyCar got an increase from its previous NBC deal. --The windows on FOX for the races will be 2.5 hours, except the Indianapolis 500 will have a 5-hour window. --The blackout of the Indy 500 telecast in the Indianapolis area remains in effect.  --Practice and qualifying for all races will be on FS1 or FS2 (Indianapolis 500 qualifying will be on FOX). The INDY NXT development series will air on FS1 or FS2, with the majority of races on FS1. This is the second television package negotiated by IndyCar since Roger Penske purchased the series following the 2019 season. ""I feel like this has been kind of a long time coming — IndyCar and the Indianapolis 500 is truly a crown jewel in not only motorsports but also sports in general,"" Shanks said. ""It truly captures the nation's attention. And as you guys have seen, under the leadership, ownership of the Penskes, there's just incredible momentum if you're ever around Indianapolis in May.""

While playing for the Cincinnati Reds, he recorded a 105.8 mph pitch on September 24, 2010."

72,John Fanta,How Illinois transfer Coleman Hawkins scored $2M NIL deal from Kansas State,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-basketball/how-illinois-transfer-coleman-hawkins-scored-2m-nil-deal-from-kansas-state,"Coleman Hawkins played it perfectly, testing the NBA Draft waters and then leveraging his transfer to land a record NIL deal from K-State.",2024-06-14T16:26:42Z,"Nobody in college basketball has ever played their cards better financially than Coleman Hawkins.  The Illinois transfer announced Friday morning that he will head to Kansas State for his fifth season. As great of a pickup as it is for Wildcats third-year head coach Jerome Tang, the bigger story is the financial piece.  Sources confirmed to FOX Sports that Hawkins will receive NIL compensation of roughly $2 million for his final year of college basketball. The Athletic's Shams Charania first reported the news. This means that Hawkins' earnings clock in as the highest-known compensation of any college basketball player heading into this season.  My reaction: credit to Hawkins, who could not have gone about this offseason any better when it comes to his wallet. If he had left the college ranks, he would be in the NBA G League making thousands of dollars and off the national radar. Instead, Hawkins will be one of the most notable returning names in the sport of college basketball and will be able to take care of himself and his family, making more money in one year than he likely ever will again in his basketball career.  To think that an All-Big Ten Second Team selection could now be making $2 million is certainly crazy, but it's a testament to a notable transfer leveraging a holdout process for more money in the end. He benefited by testing the NBA Draft waters, getting the feedback that college would be the best route going forward and taking the most lucrative offer.  Last season, the 6-foot-10 Hawkins averaged 12.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game on an Elite Eight Illini team that featured star guards Terrence Shannon Jr. and Marcus Domask.  This move by Hawkins to head to Kansas State also further solidifies that the Wildcats are a firm player with the top programs in name, image and likeness dollars. Tang, a former Scott Drew assistant, possesses a unique energy that has really raised the profile of Kansas State basketball. Hawkins joins a class that includes former Michigan guard Dug McDaniel, former Kentucky big man Ugonna Onyenso, former 4-star recruit Baye Fall and former Villanova sharpshooter Brendan Hausen.  Hawkins gives K-State a winning presence coming off a season in which he was a standout on a team that made it to a regional final. He also provides swagger and a floor spacer in the Wildcats' offense, having shot 37% from 3-point range this past year.  John Fanta is a national college basketball broadcaster and writer for FOX Sports.

73,,"Chiefs receive Super Bowl rings loaded with diamonds, but keep focus forward",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/chiefs-receive-super-bowl-rings-loaded-with-diamonds-keep-focus-forward,The Chiefs received rings loaded with 529 diamonds each to celebrate their Super Bowl LVIII win on Thursday. But their focus is now on a three-peat.,2024-06-14T14:21:20Z,"The Kansas City Chiefs are eyeing history in 2024, but before they head out on their summer break, they had one last celebration for what they accomplished in 2023. Members of the Chiefs received their Super Bowl championship rings in a private ceremony at Kansas City's Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art on Thursday. More than 400 rings were handed out at the ceremony, with each being personalized while also celebrating the franchise's history. The rings, which were made by Josten jewelers, each have 529 diamonds, 38 rubies and 14.8 carats worth of gems, and were created in 10-karat white and yellow gold. The ring tops have the Chiefs' arrowhead logo, which was shaped from 16 custom-cut rubies, representing the number of division titles the franchise has won. The arrowhead is fashioned in yellow gold and set with 50 diamonds. In the foreground of the ring top, the Chiefs' four Super Bowl trophies are outlined. The left side of the ring top has the word ""WORLD"" and the right side has ""CHAMPIONS."" ""Back-to-back"" is embezzled on one side of the ring, along with the Super Bowl LVIII logo and the final score of the game. The other side is personalized to feature the recipient's name and position. Additionally, that side includes the four years the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl (1969, 2019, 2022, 2023). That side also includes an outline of GEHA Stadium.  There are several other unique details on the ring. The game-winning play, ""Tom and Jerry,"" of Super Bowl LVIII is outlined with Andy Reid's handwriting inside the ring top. ""Loud"" and ""142.2"" are also inscribed into the rings to represent Chiefs Kingdom. There are 22 sequential diamonds to represent the number of points the Chiefs scored in the second half and overtime of the Super Bowl LVIII win.  There are also 19 diamonds within the Super Bowl LVIII logo on the ring, which is a combination of the number of consecutive winning seasons (11) and AFC West titles (eight). There's also a commemorative patch honoring Norma Hunt (""NKH"") on the inside of the ring. Hunt, the wife of Chiefs founder Lamar Hunt and the mother of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, passed away in June of last year. Each year that members of the Chiefs won a Super Bowl trophy is inscribed inside the removable top of the ring. Several members of the Chiefs, such as Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones and Reid, have three years written inside of it. They're all on the hunt for a fourth now, seeking to become the first team in NFL history to win three Super Bowl titles in a row. ""The first thing I think of is how great last season was and the adversity we dealt with,'' Mahomes said Thursday night before the Chiefs received their rings. ""Then I'm going to think about how I can get another one for the pinkie finger. It's going to take a lot of hard work (to win three straight titles). It's never been done before for a good reason. It takes a special group of guys, and I think we've got that group.'' Kansas City became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles in nearly two decades last year, with the 2003-04 New England Patriots being the last team to do it. The Chiefs have lost a handful of contributors from last year's team since their Super Bowl win in February, losing five starters from that game over the offseason. Still, the Chiefs' nucleus is still intact with Mahomes, Kelce, Reid and Jones. As minicamp concluded Thursday and the team set to embark on one last break before training, Reid knows the focus is already on making history. ""It goes by fast. Once you get through that parade, you're kind of off and heading in the direction of the new season,"" Reid told reporters of the Chiefs' Super Bowl celebration on Thursday. ""It's a night — I don't want to slight tonight — because there's a lot that goes into that and there's a lot of hard work that's gone into that and this is kind of the reward for it. But I think the guys know that it's going to be nice to get the ring, but they've moved on.""  "

See the early odds.",2024-06-14T15:02:33Z,"After injuries caused some of the NFL's most talented quarterbacks to miss most of the 2023 season, the top of the Comeback Player of the Year odds market is filled with a lot of talent.  Let's check out the early odds to win the award via DraftKings Sportsbook as of June 12. 2024 Comeback Player of the Year Odds: Aaron Rodgers, Jets: +125 (bet $10 to win $22.50 total)Joe Burrow, Bengals: +210 (bet $10 to win $31 total)Kirk Cousins, Falcons: +500 (bet $10 to win $60 total)Anthony Richardson, Colts: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)Russell Wilson, Steelers: +1200 (bet $10 to win $130 total)Nick Chubb, Browns: +1500 (bet $10 to win $160 total)Deshaun Watson, Browns: +2000 (bet $10 to win $210 total) After landing Rodgers prior to last season, expectations were set at an all-time high for the New York Jets in 2023. However, four snaps into the season opener against the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium, the star quarterback ruptured his Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.  The Jets finished the season 7-10, mostly behind their stellar defense that only allowed 20.9 points per game in 2023.  However, the offense struggled — more specifically the quarterback position. After Rodgers went down, the Jets started three other QBs last season, including Zach Wilson.  Wilson registered a passer rating of 77.2, throwing only eight touchdowns with seven interceptions before he was benched in Week 12.  In Rodgers' last full season with the Green Bay Packers, he had a passer rating of 91.1 and threw for 3,695 yards and 26 touchdowns.  According to sharp football analysis, the Jets have the fourth-easiest schedule in 2024 and their season Over/Under win total has been set at 9.5.  After Rodgers, there are some other big quarterback names on CPOY odds list.  After two seasons of leading the Cincinnati Bengals to the AFC Championship, Burrow tore a ligament in his right wrist in Cincinnati's Week 11 game against the Baltimore Ravens.  Burrow is set to return Week 1 and is currently +210 to win CPOY.  He won the award in 2021 after returning from a serious knee injury during his rookie season.  Another notable QB at the top of the oddsboard is Kirk Cousins.  It’ll be a change of scenery for the veteran QB in 2024. Cousins agreed to sign a four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons this offseason. He’ll join an offense that includes Bijan Robinson, Drake London and Kyle Pitts.  Cousins missed most of 2023 after going down with an Achilles injury in Week 8 and is currently +500 to win CPOY.  Follow along with FOX Sports for the latest news on the NFL and other sports.

The Dutch soccer association announced the Barcelona star would not be available for Euro 2024 in Germany after Ronald Koeman's team beat Iceland 4-0 in its final warmup. De Jong watched from the bench on Monday in Rotterdam. ""He won't be fit enough to play at this level for the next three weeks,"" Koeman said. ""There's no point keeping him with us."" De Jong's hopes of playing were dashed when tests ""showed that the ankle is not yet sufficiently resilient,"" Netherlands officials said in a statement. Koeman will decide later whether to call up a replacement. AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders played in midfield in De Jong's absence on Monday. [Check out our Euro 2024 preview] Another midfielder, Teun Koopmeiners, was injured while warming up for the Iceland match and was also in doubt for the tournament.

Lewandowski set up Swiderski for the opening goal in the 12th minute. But in his celebrations, Swiderski hurt his ankle and had to be replaced. Lewandowski, Poland's all-time leading goal-scorer, lasted until the 32nd when he hurt his right leg and was substituted. The double blow was a nightmare for Poland. Arkadiusz Milik was to be up front with Lewandowski for the Euros until he damaged his left knee on Friday in the friendly against Ukraine. Milik returned to Juventus and had successful knee surgery on Monday. Lewandowski and Swiderski have only until Sunday to recover when Poland opens its Euros campaign against the Netherlands in Hamburg. Turkey threatened the equalizer in the second half. Arda Güler and Orkun Köktoçü were saved but goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was helpless when halftime substitute Baris Alper Yilmaz's shot from the edge of box deflected in. After Turkey's Kerem Akturkoglu hit the crossbar from long range, Poland won in the 90th thanks to a beauty by Nicola Zalewski, who weaved past two defenders to the box and scored his maiden international goal. Turkey faces Georgia in its opener on Tuesday week in Dortmund, while Poland will be sweating on its strikers. There was nothing wrong with the Dutch attack. They have warmed up with consecutive 4-0 wins. Iceland was put to the sword in Rotterdam, with Virgil van Dijk and Wout Weghorst scoring, just as they did against Canada last Thursday at De Kuip. Xavi Simons' first goal for the Netherlands was teed up by Denzel Dumfries' header in the first half, then Nathan Ake's nod set up Van Dijk. Substitute Donyell Malen scored thanks to Memphis Depay, but Depay was denied moments later when VAR ruled out his goal because of an earlier handball. However, VAR overturned another on-field decision to allow Weghorst's goal in added time. The Czech Republic struggled to subdue North Macedonia 2-1, needing two second-half penalties in Hradec Králové. After Malta was ravaged 7-1 last Friday, the Czechs made nine changes to give their likely Euro lineup a run before facing Portugal in a week in Leipzig. But nobody scored until the 60th when Patrik Schick converted a penalty for a foul on Tomas Soucek. Just five minutes later, North Macedonia was level after Isnik Alimi headed in a rebound of Aleksandar Trajkovski's shot off the right post. The Czechs needed all seven minutes of added time to find the winner, from a spot kick by Antonin Barak. They suffered a setback on Sunday when midfielder Michal Sadilek, who captained the team against Malta, withdrew from the Euro 2024 squad after injuring his shin from falling off a bike on a day off.

77,,UFL 2024: Playoffs by the numbers,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/ufl/ufl-2024-playoffs-by-the-numbers,The inaugural UFL playoffs were one for the books! Here are the numbers to know ahead of this weekend's championship title game.,2024-06-10T23:15:03Z,"The inaugural UFL playoffs were one for the books!  Newly minted MVP Adrian Martinez and the Birmingham Stallions kicked things off by beating the Michigan Panthers by double digits in Saturday's USFL Conference Championship Game, 31-18, after trailing by 15 points in the first half. On Sunday, the San Antonio Brahmas stunned the St. Louis Battlehawks, 25-15, on the road in the XFL title game. These two will face off against one another in the highly anticipated UFL Championship Game on FOX on June 16. Here are the numbers to know ahead of this weekend's title game. 7: It had been seven weeks since Birmingham QB Matt Corral had last taken a snap in Week 4, but he came off the bench to replace Adrian Martinez and led the offense on two touchdown drives late in the third quarter of the Stallions' tilt. 8: The number of turnovers in the USFL Conference title game, with Birmingham and Michigan both coughing up the ball four times. Six of those eight turnovers came in the third quarter, including three in a five-play span. 10: Corey Chamblin, who took over late in the season after John Chavis left the team due to a health issue, and his Stallions defense held the Panthers to zero points on their final 10 drives of the game. Birmingham's defense also accounted for a crucial score, courtesy of a pick-six that tied the game in the third quarter. 15: The Stallions trailed 18-3 in the second quarter of the USFL title game, and it looked like their quest for a third consecutive spring championship title was coming to an end. They turned things around by scoring the final 28 points of the game. That 15-point deficit was the largest that Birmingham had faced at any point in the last three spring seasons. 22: Birmingham has an opportunity to avenge their only loss of the regular season against San Antonio on Sunday. The Stallions will also be going for a historic three-peat. The last franchise to win three straight titles in the NFL, NBA, MLB or NHL was when the Los Angeles Lakers accomplished the feat 22 years ago in 2002. 31: The Brahmas’ top-ranked defense has played the two best scoring offenses in the UFL for the past three weeks — Birmingham in Week 9, followed by St. Louis in Week 10 and again in the XFL Championship Game. San Antonio has only allowed a total of 31 offensive points over those three games. 50: Michigan's star kicker Jake Bates put the Panthers up 18-3 with his fourth field goal of the first half, but his ensuing kickoff went out of bounds and was placed at the 50-yard line. Stallions QB Martinez then hit tight end Jordan Thomas for a touchdown on the next play to ignite the Stallions' comeback. 69: San Antonio RB Anthony McFarland’s 69-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter of Sunday's game was the longest run by any player in the UFL this season. After missing four weeks with a shoulder injury, McFarland has been a major asset late in the season. The former Maryland Terrapin is averaging 123.7 total yards per game in his three appearances since returning in Week 8. 111: An area of concern for Birmingham is penalties. On Saturday, the Stallions racked up 11 penalties for 111 yards against the Panthers — both numbers were their worst in past three spring seasons. 213: With John Lovett and McFarland in action in the San Antonio backfield, the Brahmas' run game was at its best in the playoffs, averaging over 6.0 yards per carry and totaling 213 yards on the ground. This marked the first time the team had gone over 200 rushing yards all season. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

78,,"2024 U.S. Open odds, predictions: Scottie Scheffler huge favorite to win",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/golf/2024-u-s-open-odds-predictions-favorites-picks-from-field,"Looking to get some golf bets down? Read here for a list of the latest odds, favorites and long-shot bets to win the U.S. Open.",2024-06-11T03:03:16Z,"By Vik ChokshiFOX Sports Gambling Lead The third major of the season is finally here, with the U.S. Open taking place at Pinehurst Resort in Pinehurst, North Carolina.  The tournament will be played on Course No. 2, a par-70 track that is 7,588 yards long with Bermudagrass greens. Wyndham Clark, the defending champion, opened at +7000 to win it all. As for betting on the tournament, we've got you covered with everything you need, from the odds to best bets. Let's dive into the action. Scottie Scheffler is the clear-cut favorite entering the tournament, just as he is in all the tournaments he plays in. Scheffler currently sits at +300 to win it all. Xander Schauffele, who won the PGA Championship in May, and Rory McIlroy, last year's runner-up, are tied for the second-best odds at +1100.  Scheffler is on a tear in 2024. He picked up his fifth tournament win since March on Sunday, winning the Memorial. While Scheffler won his second green jacket at the Masters in April, he's never won at any of the other three majors. Despite that fact, Scheffler's +300 odds to win the tournament are the best a golfer's had to win a major since 2009, when Tiger Woods was a +180 favorite to win the PGA Championship. Woods is the only golfer in the last 40 years to have shorter odds to win a major tournament. Scheffler has been a money-making machine for his backers this year. Per GolfBet, if you placed $100 on him to win every tournament this season, you'd be up $1600. The new dad has consistently finished in the top 10 this season. He's currently at -120 to finish the event in the top five, while his odds to have a top-10 finish are -250 at DraftKings Sportsbook. Tiger Woods is participating in the U.S. Open for the first time since 2020. But he's a long-shot bet to win this weekend, holding +30000 odds entering the event. Historically, he has done well here, finishing in the top three the last two times he played the U.S. Open at Pinehurst. You can't talk about Tiger without bringing up Phil Mickelson, who's had his fair share of struggles in the U.S. Open. The lefty has +35000 odds to win the event.  Now that we teed off with the basics, let's approach the top favorites and my early pick to win the tournament. One player whose name is usually around the top of the betting board is Rahm.  On Tuesday, the 2021 U.S. Open winner withdrew from the event.

79,Laken Litman,What Emma Hayes learned from her first USWNT camp,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/what-emma-hayes-learned-from-her-first-uswnt-camp,Emma Hayes sees the partnership between her and the United States women's national team as mutually beneficial.,2024-06-11T00:13:00Z,"For Emma Hayes, there was no relief by the end of her inaugural camp as the new U.S. women's national team head coach. But that's not what she was looking for anyway. The U.S. convincingly beat South Korea twice in four days, giving glimpses into what Hayes' new-look squad could be in the future. The results were steps in the right direction, but as Hayes repeated time and again, there's more work to do. And the Paris Olympics begin next month. ""When I think of relief, I remember what it's like to win a title,"" said Hayes, who has won plenty. ""You get to the end and you think, ‘That's relief.' ""I feel something very different. I feel like I really can have a big influence on this group. In turn, they're going to have a big influence on me. And I told them that; I haven't stopped smiling."" The last six months have been a unique transition period for the USWNT and for Hayes. Now, at last, the two parties are one and the same. During training camp, Hayes and her coaching staff stuffed everything they possibly could into the players. She overloaded them with information and methodology, noting there would be some ""tired brains."" She introduced her style, strategy and vision, and drilled down on the importance of details, trust and process. She held individual meetings with players to get to know them on a personal level — everything from where they were from to how many siblings they had and more. She did all of these things while being her outwardly confident and jovial self, projecting as the fearless leader needed to restore winning ways to the four-time World Cup champions. ""She definitely brings some lightheartedness into situations when necessary, but she's someone who is really excited and adamant about getting her point across,"" Alex Morgan said of her first impressions of Hayes. ""She's demanding of respect, but I think that it's mutual. She came into this environment and respects every player regardless of the journey [they've had] to get to this team and how many caps each player has. She's really big on building trust and getting feedback from players as well in meetings. ""She's a coach that I think is at the perfect place in this program."" Players absorbed everything like sponges, and by the end of camp were using the same language as Hayes to explain what they had learned. Examples of this came on goals that were scored in both wins over South Korea. In the first match, center back Tierna Davidson scored two goals off headers from corner kicks. In the second, 16-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes was in the right place at the right time to finish off a cross from Trinity Rodman. Both players said their goals were direct results of what Hayes and her staff had been layering in all week. South Korea was a formidable tuneup opponent as the Americans prepare to face Zambia, Germany and Australia in the Olympics group stage. But this camp wasn't as much about the competition as it was about time spent together and getting on the same page. ""I think whenever you're in a transition period, when you're bringing in new staff, there's a lot of ‘new,'"" Crystal Dunn said. ""You have to almost start from the very beginning, the foundation. But that doesn't mean we're reinventing the wheel or we're speaking a different language. It's going into so much detail that you're like, ‘Cool, this is a lot of detail, but this is meaningful information that she touched on.' Camps down the road, we won't have to go back to the beginning."" Hayes compared her role here as that of a ""heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery."" Not because there was anything ""drastically wrong"" with the USWNT, but because it was difficult to teach her concepts and do the surgery with such a limited amount of time before the next major tournament. If the goal of this camp was laying the groundwork and teaching as much as possible, Hayes said her next objective is about ""bringing everybody up to that level where everybody can do the surgery."" Hayes was officially hired back in November, but under the unique condition that she would complete her 12th and final season with Chelsea. She said she envisioned what this moment would be like over the last six months, but once she was physically with the team, a few things surprised her. For one, there was a better tactical understanding than she anticipated and she was pleased with how quickly the team could grasp information. She called the players ""exceptionally bright"" and ""cerebral"" and said they ""can articulate concepts and ideas in a way that really challenges me,"" which she enjoys. She believes the team is ""bold enough, brave enough to want whatever it takes to improve,"" and that they have moved on from the 2023 World Cup. More than anything, it seemed Hayes was particularly touched by how caring and embracing the environment is. She said she got teary-eyed listening to players talk about the history of the program and why it's important to them. From the outside, she always thought the USWNT was special — after all, this was her dream job. Now on the inside, she can see firsthand why. And it was extra apparent to Hayes when Yohannes scored her first goal in her first cap to clinch a 3-0 victory for the USWNT last week. The entire team — including the bench — enveloped the youngster in a joyful celebration. ""I think the team has really bought into what it's going to take for us to progress,"" Hayes said. ""It's an adaptable team, a resilient team, a flexible team — these are their words, not mine. I get excited by growth, and I'm excited for our development together."" Hayes' first assignment is a very public and high stakes one. She relishes the opportunity to coach in an Olympics and understands the short runway she has to close gaps that were on display at the World Cup. The Americans were shockingly eliminated in the round of 16 following a dramatic penalty shootout with Sweden. While some inside U.S. Soccer would say that change had been bubbling for some time, the historically early exit was the catalyst to where the team finds itself now. But players believe they are in a better place and the vibes are stronger than they were last summer. ""I think we made some amazing strides in this camp,"" Rose Lavelle said. ""I think the coaching staff has helped us grow and learn so much, and I think this group is very hungry and thirsty for knowledge, so it's been good."" In the coming weeks, Hayes will determine her 18-player roster for the Olympics. It will be a tough task because ""there is an unbelievable talent pool in this country,"" Hayes said. For those who do not make the cut, all it means is that the roster was too small (by comparison, 23 players are selected for a World Cup). Younger players especially can take solace in the fact that Hayes is building something greater beyond whatever happens in Paris this summer, and they will be involved in that.  Her charge is to bring the USWNT back to the top of the soccer pedestal.

80,,Aaron Judge making MLB history since early May: By the numbers,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/aaron-judge-making-mlb-history-since-early-may-numbers,Aaron Judge is in the midst of not only the best stretch of his career but one of the best in MLB history. FOX Sports Research broke down the numbers.,2024-06-10T21:11:38Z,"Aaron Judge got off to such a slow start to the 2024 MLB season that there was concern about whether the New York Yankees captain would regain his MVP form. Turns out, there was no need to worry. Not only is Judge back to his usual superstar self, he has been playing the best baseball of his decorated career. That's no small feat for a player who already owns the American League home run record and an MVP award. His production over the past five-plus weeks has vaulted him back to the top of the AL MVP race, this time alongside his own teammate in Juan Soto. Judge continued his incredible hot streak during a massive series this past weekend against the Dodgers while Soto was sidelined with a forearm injury. Judge crushed three more home runs, including one in the Yankees' 6-4 win Sunday, to pull further ahead in the MLB lead with 24 on the season. But just how good has Judge been over the past month and change? The FOX Sports Research team crunched the most notable numbers. .412: Since May 2nd, Judge (.412) is the only player in baseball hitting .400 or better with a minimum of 50 at-bats  .700: Judge is currently slugging .702. The last player to slug .700 or better was Barry Bonds in 2004 (.812). The last occurrence in the American League was Mark McGwire in 1996 (.730). .994: Judge's .994 career OPS is the highest among all active players, as he recently surpassed Mike Trout (.991) 1.553: Aaron Judge has compiled a 1.553 OPS over his past 32 games. That is the highest mark over a 32-game stretch since Barry Bonds in 2004 and the highest by a Yankee since Babe Ruth in 1924. 2: If Judge finishes 2024 with a wRC+ of 200 or better — he's currently at 214 — it would be his second season eclipsing the 200 threshold. That would give him more such campaigns than all other AL players combined since 1958 (Frank Thomas' 205 wRC+ in 1994 is the only 200-plus season during this span). 3: Judge joined Chick Hafey and Joe DiMaggio as the only players to accumulate 31 or more extra-base hits over a 30-game span. 3.2135: Aaron Judge has hit a home run every 3.2135 games over his career. That is the fewest games per home run in a career in MLB history. He narrowly edges out Mark McGwire (3.2144) and Babe Ruth (3.5056). 5: Aaron Judge's 214 wRC+ puts him on pace to become just the fifth AL player since 1901 (start of the AL) to post multiple seasons of 200 wRC+ or better, joining Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle and Ty Cobb. 9: Aaron Judge has hit nine home runs in the first inning this season. That is more than 15 teams have hit in the first inning and as many as he had in the first inning all of last season. 11: As of Monday, Judge is the major-league leader across 10 major categories, including WAR (bWAR 5.0; fWAR 4.9), OBP (.436), SLG (.703), OPS (1.139), total bases (168), home runs (24), extra-base hits (46), times on base (130), runs created (74), wRC+ (214) and OPS+ (217). 12: As of Monday, Judge is projected to accrue 12 bWAR for the 2024 season. If that held up, he would join Babe Ruth as the only Yankees to post a bWAR of 12 or higher for a season. He would also be just the fourth position player in MLB history to reach 12 bWAR in a season and first since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 (12.5). 14: Since May 2nd, Judge has 14 games with multiple RBIs, the most in the majors over that span 18: His 18 homers since May 2nd are more than 26 other MLB outfields, and double four team’s outfields (Rangers, Mets, Brewers and Rockies) 19: The Yankees are 19-3 this season when Judge hits at least one homer  58: Judge, who owns the AL record with 62 homers in a season, is currently on pace for 58 homers this year. Only Babe Ruth has multiple 58-homer seasons in AL history. Only Ruth, McGwire and Sammy Sosa have twice reached that figure in MLB history. 67: Judge is the first American League player since Frank Thomas in 1994 to amass at least 24 homers and 50 walks within a team’s first 67 games. 114: Judge has five home runs this season with an exit velocity of 114 mph or higher, the most in the majors and more than 15 other teams combined. 120: Judge has been an on-base machine, accumulating 120 total bases since May 2nd, 33 more than any other player over that span. To put that in perspective, José Ramírez, who is second with 87 total bases, could have back-to-back four-homer games and would still be one base behind Judge. 200: Aaron Judge has a 200 OPS+ since 2022 (his age 30-32 seasons). The only player with a higher OPS+ through those seasons is Babe Ruth, who had an OPS+ of 203. 214: His wRC+ is currently at 214, the sixth-highest since World War II behind only 2002 Bonds (244), 2001 Bonds (235), 2004 Bonds (233), 1957 Ted Williams (223) and 1957 Mickey Mantle (217). 281: Judge hit his 281st career home run Sunday, which is the most through any player’s first 1,000 games in their career. Judge has played only 902 games. 460: The longest home runs hit this season were by Mike Trout and Aaron Judge (473 feet). Judge, however, is the only player to have hit three home runs 460 feet or farther. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

81,,Caitlin Clark's Olympics snub: Did women's basketball blow the layup?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/wnba/caitlin-clark-olympics-snub-did-womens-basketball-blow-layup,"Caitlin Clark was left off the U.S. women's Olympic basketball team, and FS1's talent Joy Taylor, Colin Cowherd, and Paul Pierce discuss that decision.",2024-06-11T01:55:00Z,"The ""Caitlin Clark Effect."" For the first time in history, the whole world is talking about women's basketball. Why? Because Caitlin Clark sent viewership and engagement to new levels while becoming the most prolific scorer — male or female — in college basketball history. And as the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Indiana Fever, she has brought this following with her into the WNBA.  Yet, she was left off of the 2024 U.S. Women's Olympic basketball team. And some people are not happy. Colin Cowherd voiced his disapproval of the decision on FS1's ""The Herd"" on Monday. ""Caitlin Clark, who is not one of the top 12-15 WNBA players, did not make the Olympic team,"" Cowhered said. ""But Christian Laettner wasn't one of the top 100 players in the NBA, and he made an Olympic team. Jaylen Brown is not on this (upcoming Men's) Olympic team, and he's one of the top 15 players. So, if it seems that talent is not the only factor that guarantees a spot for players on the Olympic team, what does? According to Cowherd, it's all about ""politics."" ""Olympic basketball teams, men's and women's has always been subjective and very political. Isaiah Thomas didn't make it. Why? Michael Jordan didn't like him,"" Cowherd said. ""To me, it feels like an opportunity wasted."" Cowherd went on to argue that not only would Clark garner viewership for the women's Olympic team, but she would also make her teammates money in endorsements. ""The WNBA finals had 700,000 viewers. The draft that included Caitlin Clark had three times as many. I would make the argument, like a Tiger Woods or a Connor McGregor in their prime, that she would make other people money beyond herself."" Cowherd said. ""The women's Olympic team does not lose in the Olympics. I think they've won seven straight golds, but you wouldn't know that. Cause you didn't watch. And [with Clark] you would."" Cowherd compares Clark's success to that of Muhammad Ali and Tiger Woods, explaining that Caitlin Clark has been the foundation behind putting women's basketball on the map.  ""Life gives you few big waves. When they do, grab your surfboard,"" he said.  But according to Cowherd, women's basketball missed this wave, this opportunity, to continue the upward trajectory of women's basketball viewership and engagement.  ""She would triple the TV ratings. The NBA would die to have a domestic star nearly as popular as Caitlin Clark. Oh wait, they do. Anthony Edwards. They put him on the team. Anthony Edwards isn't as good as Jaylen Brown. Yet, they found a spot for him on the team,"" Cowherd said. Putting Caitlin Clark on the team isn't just about Clark. Cowherd explained that including her would be beneficial for everyone on the team: ""Women's basketball feels like it's suffering from spite, or historically low self-esteem, or they want to prove that they know more than you do. Here's what I know: Caitlin Clark would make all the other women on the Olympic team money. She would make them more famous; she would give them more opportunity; they'd become potentially more household names. It's an opportunity wasted."" There was a clear, easy answer to whether or not Clark should be on the team. Women's basketball answered incorrectly. ""Some stuff is business 101,"" Cowherd said. ""This is a lay-up. And you blew it.""  Later on in the episode, Cowherd talked to the Philadelphia 76's head coach Nick Nurse, who expressed his agreement with Cowherd, yet offered a new perspective on the situation. ""It's good and bad,"" Nurse said. ""I almost can't believe it. Cause I agree with you that the ratings, just everything continues to roll on if she's on the team. But I'm almost happy for her, too. I think the amount of pressure she's been under; taking that team from Iowa to the national championships twice, that has never been there at all. At least she doesn't have to have another ramp up of incredible scrutiny and pressure."" Nurse wasn't the only one surprised that Clark was left off the roster. On this past episode of FS1's ""Speak,"" Joy Taylor expressed how she found the decision to be incredibly unexpected. Yet, she explained that there are two factors that go into making the decision of who gets put on the team.  ""Who is the best to represent the United States of America as the U.S. women's Olympic basketball team — that is a separate conversation from what would be the best for growing the sport,"" Taylor said. ""The attention that the sport is getting is because of Caitlin Clark. She is bringing eyeballs; she is bringing sponsors; she is putting people in the seats; she is causing all the conversation."" Taylor framed the whole issue as a business decision. ""From a marketing perspective, from a business perspective, you can't argue the numbers [Clark is generating],"" Taylor said. ""What is conflicting for me, is when do we talk about the sport, and not just the novelty, and the drama, and the eyeballs, and the ratings, and the religion, and the politics, and the race. From a business perspective, I agree. It wasn't the right decision."" Paul Pierce agreed with Taylor, explaining on FS1's ""Undisputed,"" that having Clark on the team was a business decision, and women's basketball blew it. ""You claim you want the women's game to grow, but you keep the most popular girl in women's basketball off the team,"" Pierce said. ""Sometimes you have to say ‘hey guys, this is bigger than the game.’ Women's basketball is at an all-time high because of Caitlin Clark. I think [women's basketball] is taking a step back. It just doesn't make sense to me. Women's basketball dropped the ball on this one."" [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

82,,3 strong takes: Did the Lakers actually lowball Dan Hurley?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/did-lakers-lowball-dan-hurley-what-it-says-about-franchise,"Dan Hurley's decision to turn down the Lakers' offer reveals some harsh realities about the NBA's most storied franchise. Colin Cowherd, Nick Wright and Chris Broussard explain why.",2024-06-11T01:23:54Z,"Dan Hurley's decision to spurn a reported six-year, $70 million contract offer from the Los Angeles Lakers and return to the University of Connecticut was one of the biggest wins in program history. No, it is not a seventh national title, but the city of Storrs celebrated it like one. After all, Hurley's return means that UConn has a chance to be the first men's basketball program to three-peat since John Wooden's legendary UCLA dynasty in the 1960s and 1970s. But it also points to a shakiness within the Lakers' own building in what shapes up to be a pivotal season for the franchise — and potentially LeBron James' final one before retirement. If the Lakers wanted a ""program-builder"" type of coach to build around Anthony Davis in the post-James era, why did they offer a contract that would have barely ranked in the top five of current NBA head coach salaries? ""If [Lakers general manager/vice president] Rob Pelinka were actually held to account by his boss — which I don't actually think happens with the Lakers — what is his ‘Hey boss, here's what happened'?"" Nick Wright said on Monday's edition of ""First Things First,"" roughly 90 minutes after FOX Sports confirmed the news of Hurley's decision. ""Is it either ‘we very publicly went after a guy that all along we knew we were gonna lowball,' or is it, 'Boss, it went just the way he had planned. The whole world thinks now we tried really hard to get a guy, we knew we could never get him, and now we're just gonna hire the cheap coach we were always gonna hire.'"" To Wright's point, the Lakers' late owner Jerry Buss once famously made a five-year, $40 million offer to legendary Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski in 2004 that would have made the then-three-time NCAA men's basketball champion the highest-paid coach in the NBA. [Fanta: Why Dan Hurley chose to stay at UConn, and what's next for Huskies' head coach] The offer reportedly made to Hurley by Pelinka and current owner Jeanie Buss, Jerry's daughter, would have made Hurley the fourth-highest-paid coach in the NBA, with the $11.67 million he would reportedly earn per year much less than the $17.5 million per year Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr currently makes.  In fact, Hurley would have been just the fifth-highest-paid coach in the NBA per year behind Kerr, the San Antonio Spurs' Gregg Popovich, Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat and Monty Williams of the Detroit Pistons. ""You can't come to the table saying 'hey, you'll be fifth in the league,'"" Wright said. ""I don't think they had to make him first. But there is a Monty Williams bar to clear, there just is. Here is the problem with the Lakers. … Either all along, you didn't expect to get this guy, and it was all a ruse for PR, or you really thought you were getting him, and you couldn't get him. ""I just think they're poorly run."" Wright's ""First Things First"" co-host Chris Broussard agreed, saying that the rumors of the Lakers preparing to make Hurley a deal he could not refuse to pry him away from the program he just led to back-to-back national championships did not mesh with the offer ultimately reported by ESPN on Monday. ""You're the Lakers, this is the two-time national champion,"" an incredulous Broussard said Monday. ""And they're looking at [Celtics general manager/former head coach] Brad Stevens, and what he's built in Boston, and Oklahoma City building a franchise. That's what they wanted. Then make him an offer he can't refuse.  ""They offered [Krzyzewski] $8 million in 2004, 20 years ago. $8 million 20 years ago is a lot more than $11.6 million today. … It's the same family. You could've justified it — I'm not saying Hurley is ‘Coach K,' but he's about the closest thing right now."" However, ""The Herd"" co-host Colin Cowherd believes the realities of how the NBA is constructed may have also factored into Hurley's decision, as he believes Hurley may have had an uphill battle to find success with the Lakers no matter how much they would have paid him. ""Don't confuse big brand with great job,"" Cowherd said. ""The NBA isn't the NFL. It's not [Major League] Baseball where you can just buy as much as you want. It's not football where you can trade almost anybody you want. You've got a salary cap, and you have to have matching salaries to trade it. They don't have a lot of draft capital.  ""Also — and I don't think this can be underscored — LeBron is a lot. In LeBron's prime, you would put up with anything. He got you to the Finals. [Now] he gets you to the play-in game in the West, and by the way the West's young players — [Nikola] Jokic is getting better, [Anthony Edwards] is getting better, Luka [Doncic] is getting better. … This is not college sports where a Jim Harbaugh or a Steve Sarkisian or a Kirby Smart can walk into Georgia and get 25 first-round picks every year. The Lakers don't have two of their next four first-round picks."" And now, the Lakers will not have Dan Hurley leading them into the next chapter of their storied history.

Check out the relevant odds before Dodgers-Yankees.",2024-06-07T14:52:06Z,"One of the most anticipated series of the MLB regular season begins Friday night, as the Dodgers travel across the country to face the Yankees. The two historic franchises have only met twice over the past eight years. With Shohei Ohtani, Juan Soto, Aaron Judge, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman set to take the field this weekend, the stars will be on full display in the Big Apple.  Dates & Times Friday: 7:05 EST (Apple TV) Saturday: 7:35 EST (FOX) Sunday: 7pm EST (ESPN) According to Draftkings Sportsbook, the Dodgers are -115 to win the series this weekend while the Yankees -105.  New York comes into this series tied for best record in Major League Baseball and has won eight games in a row, and the star-studded duo of Judge and Soto has been dominant as of late.  Judge leads the MLB in home runs and, according to Draftkings Sportsbook, is currently the favorite to win the AL MVP (+180).  Soto currently has the second-best odds to win AL MVP (+235), as he has the third-best batting average in the league and is in the top five in batting average, HRs and RBIs.  Similarly, the Dodgers have also had a good start to the year, as they sit atop the NL West and have the second-best record in the NL. After signing Ohtani to a record-breaking 10-year, $700 million deal, the two-time MVP has lived up to the hype through the first two months of the season.  Ohtani is second in the league in batting average (.322) and currently has the second-best odds to win NL MVP (+450) behind his teammate Mookie Betts (+110).  The Dodgers will have their three top starting pitchers on the mound this weekend, as Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Friday, Gavin Stone on Saturday, and ace Tyler Glasnow on Sunday.  After coming over from Tampa Bay in the offseason, Glasnow has been fantastic, leading the MLB in strikeouts through June 6. However, over his last five starts, the Dodgers have failed to provide much run support, as they have scored just eight runs total.  On Sunday night, Glasnow will square off with Yankees ace Luis Gil. Gil has a 1.82 ERA so far this season.  At DraftKings, Glasnow’s NL Cy Young odds are currently at +650, while Gil’s AL Cy Young odds sit at +1600.  Lastly, coming into the series, the Dodgers remain World Series favorites (+290), with the surging Yankees at +500, the second-best odds, according to DraftKings.  Follow along with FOX Sports for the latest news on the MLB and other sports.

84,RJ Young,Predicting the top-rated players in EA Sports 'College Football 25',https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/predicting-top-rated-players-ea-sports-college-football-25,"FOX Sports' RJ Young shares who he believes will be the top-rated players in EA Sports ""College Football 25,"" with a pair of standout defensive backs leading the list.",2024-06-07T17:09:57Z,"There is not a player who should receive a 99 overall rating in EA Sports' ""College Football 25"" video game, which is set to be released July 19. For the most part, the coveted 99 overall rating has been reserved for Heisman Trophy winners and consensus top-five overall selections heading into the upcoming NFL Draft. The last 99 OVR player was South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney in ""NCAA Football ‘14,"" and he was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft. Other 99s include former USC QB Matt Leinart, former USC running back Reggie Bush, former Florida QB Tim Tebow, former Stanford QB Andrew Luck and former Arkansas running back Darren McFadden. Put another way, that's three Heisman winners, and the No. 1 and No. 4 overall selection in their respective NFL Drafts. Heading into 2024, I believe the upcoming NFL Draft class to be deep. And there's always the chance that some player breaks out as the season unfolds and ascends into the God-tier of EA Sports' ""College Football 25."" Here are the players I think will have the highest rating in this year's game, counting down from No. 5-to-1: 5. Georgia QB Carson Beck: 97  2023 stats: 72.4% passing, 3,941 passing yards, 24 passing TDs, 6 INTs These are solid numbers for Beck, who has done everything but lead Georgia to an SEC title and national championship. The Bulldogs enjoy being balanced on offense, especially given the talent Kirby Smart has assembled on defense. But this season will be Beck's first without the best tight end he might ever play with in Brock Bowers, who caught 56 passes for 714 yards with six TDs last year. No one else accounted for more than 550 yards receiving on Georgia's 2023 roster. Developing a kinship with a receiving corps that will look to pick up the slack will be at the top of Beck's passing agenda. 4. Texas QB Quinn Ewers: 97 2023 stats: 69% passing, 3,479 passing yards, 22 passing TDs, 6 INTs Ewers might be the most talented quarterback in the sport this year. When he's had time to throw, he's shown himself capable of being accurate deep down the field. While he lost first-round pick Xavier Worthy and tight end JT Sanders to the NFL Draft, he saw the Longhorns add former Alabama wide out Isaiah Bond and tight end Amari Niblack to an offense that returns Johntay Cook and CJ Baxter. For Ewers, the question is: Can he remain healthy for the entire season? In two years, he hasn't played an entire season without missing at least one game due to injury. It will be interesting to see how ""College Football 25"" accounts for that. 3. Oklahoma State RB Ollie Gordon II: 98 2023 stats: 285 rushes, 1,732 rushing yards, 2,062 total yards, 21 rushing TDs, 39 catches  A workhorse like former Oklahoma State running back and 2,000-yard rusher Chubba Hubbard, Gordon is on a path that could see him not just lead the Cowboys back to the Big 12 title game, but firmly supplant his name in the Heisman conversation. After becoming OSU's first Doak Walker Award winner, he could end the year as not just OSU's best tailback since Hubbard, but perhaps its best since Barry Sanders won the Heisman 36 years ago. 2. Colorado CB/WR Travis Hunter: 98  2023 stats: 57 catches, 721 receiving yards, five receiving touchdowns, 30 tackles, 2 TFLs, 3 INTs, 5 pass breakups Hunter has demonstrated he's elite, and he won the Paul Hornung Award — given to the nation's best all-purpose player — last year as a sophomore. He's a safe bet to be selected in the top 10 of the NFL Draft next year, and he could end the season as a Heisman finalist if he increases his production on both sides of the ball and if the Buffaloes are good. While Deion ""Coach Prime"" Sanders has been an unqualified success at Colorado — quadrupling the Buffs' win total from 2022 to 2023 — 4-8 is not a successful season for fans who crave playing in bowl games and seeing players like Hunter — or quarterback Shedeur Sanders for that matter — enjoy success befitting their talent. The only drawback to Hunter is how healthy he might be down the stretch, given he's likely to play over 1,000 snaps this season. There is also the 294 receiving yards that he and the Buffs gave up to Stanford wideout Elic Ayomanor, who would be right to say, ""If Hunter is a 98, then I'm a 99."" 1. Oklahoma S Billy Bowman Jr.: 98 2023 stats: 63 tackles, 6 INTs, 3 INTs returned for TDsAdded stat: Gave JT Sanders the ""knick-knack, patty-whack, gave that man a crack."" In 2008, Ohio State defensive back Malcolm Jenkins accounted for 57 tackles and three interceptions on a team that finished 10-3. For his efforts, Jenkins won the Thorpe Award and earned a rating of 96 in ""NCAA Football ‘09."" Bowman did it better on a team that also finished 10-3. Honorable mention: Ohio State S Caleb Downs: 96 Ohio State WR Emeka Egbuka: 96 Michigan DT Mason Graham: 95 Georgia DB Malaki Starks: 95 Notre Dame DL Howard Cross III: 95 Alabama QB Jalen Milroe: 94 Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders: 94 Michigan DB Will Johnson: 94 Oregon QB Dillon Gabriel: 94 Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart: 93 RJ Young is a national college football writer and analyst for FOX Sports and the host of the podcast ""The Number One College Football Show.""

86,Bob Pockrass,"As NASCAR returns to Iowa, which other tracks should make a comeback?",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/nascar-returns-iowa-other-tracks-should-make-comeback,"With NASCAR heading to Iowa this week for the first time since 2019, Cup drivers share which other tracks they'd like to see make a return.",2024-06-10T13:00:46Z,"SONOMA, Calif. — Ever since Iowa Speedway opened in 2006, fans from the state have clamored for a Cup Series race. It didn't appear likely, considering NASCAR bought the track in 2013 and did not run any NASCAR national series races there from 2020-2023. But wanting another short track on the schedule, NASCAR decided last year to take a Cup race to the 0.875-mile oval to the track in 2024. Most of the drivers have experience at the track as the trucks and Xfinity Series ran there from 2009-2019. ""I remember fans, particularly, always talking about how bad they want a Cup race, so I'm just excited that they finally got a Cup race,"" said Cup driver Chase Elliott. ""I feel like it's been a worthy facility for a long time and whatever the reason may be or however long we go, I think it's good that they have done things right over the years and got one."" What other tracks fit that bill? Drivers have a variety of opinions. Elliott's vote has always been for the Nashville (Tenn.) Fairgrounds Speedway: ""That would be a really good one,"" he said. The track needs upgrades to have a major NASCAR event, and Speedway Motorsports has spent several years trying to come up with a proposal that will allow it (owners of Charlotte, Bristol, Texas, Atlanta and more) to rebuild the city-owned facility and operate it under a lease agreement. So far, it is mired in the Nashville political process with no clear successful timeline. Ryan Blaney wants to see NASCAR return to Chicagoland Speedway, a 1.5-mile track located in Joliet — about 45 minutes outside of Chicago. The NASCAR street race in the heart of Chicago is in its second year of a three-year deal. The intermediate tracks so far have enjoyed some of the best racing with NASCAR's still relatively new Next Gen car that it is possible Chicagoland could put on a great show. ""Joliet deserves to have a race back at it,"" Blaney said. ""I definitely think the track we need to revitalize. If we're revitalizing tracks, let's revitalize Chicago. You start with that one. The other ones I don't have too many opinions about."" There are at least a couple of tracks in North Carolina that are clamoring for races, but NASCAR already has two events at Charlotte, one in North Wilkesboro and two more in South Carolina at Darlington. The 1-mile Rockingham Speedway, which had Cup races up until 2004, has been renovated under private ownership. And NASCAR just purchased the racing promoting rights to the quarter-mile Bowman Gray Stadium, a municipal facility in Winston-Salem that doubles as a football stadium and racetrack. A race at Bowman Gray likely would be an exhibition, such as the Clash. The Clash is ending its three-year run at a track temporarily constructed inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It was a novel event and put NASCAR in another big city market. Some drivers feel that being in big cities is key. NASCAR has shown, with the Chicago street race and the Clash, that it can race pretty much anywhere. ""I like Denver,"" said California native Tyler Reddick. ""It would be really cool if we could somehow race on the streets of New York City. It probably will never happen, but it would be cool if it did. ""I love [the track] Homestead-Miami, but I wish it was closer to Miami. And we need to be racing in L.A. somewhere."" They can race pretty much anywhere, including international venues. NASCAR took the Xfinity Series to Mexico City and Montreal in the 2000s to race on the same courses as Formula 1 events.  NASCAR is expected to have one international race on its 2025 Cup schedule. ""Montreal,"" said William Byron when asked what track (not just international) he'd like to see added to the schedule. ""I'd be excited to see Montreal. That one is high on my list for sure. I grew up watching NASCAR races there on TV. The area is really cool, and I feel like it would bring a lot of excitement to the Cup Series."" But does NASCAR need to add big cities? Cup champion driver and team co-owner Brad Keselowski said Iowa fits an important role. ""[Iowa] is exposing us to just a different part of the country, different region that's hungry for our sport and it's going to embrace us at all levels — whether it be the fans in the stands or the corporate partnerships,"" Keselowski said. ""I think we get caught up in this flashy New York City or pick your hot city of the day, and we forget sometimes to serve markets that already love us. ""That's a tough balancing act that I have empathy for NASCAR when they make those decisions. But is nice to go somewhere like that, where the fan base is already there. They're ready. They're excited, and they're committed to our sport."" Keselowski has an idea for a similar area. ""I feel like if we raced in Toronto, Canada — really multiple areas in Canada, we would experience that same sentiment,"" Keselowski said. ""Hopefully one day we'll do that."" Drivers believe that NASCAR needs to have a new venue or return to a track they previously raced on every year. NASCAR has added several venues in recent years with the L.A. Coliseum, Chicago street race, Circuit of the Americas, North Wilkesboro (for the all-star race) and a short-lived return to Road America (2021-22).  ""Any time we go to a new facility or a new town of any sort, it's been a home run,"" said two-time Cup champion Joey Logano. ""Think of Road America. It's not the biggest town there, but people show up. It's the unknown. People like change and new things. Adding a new track to the circuit every year makes total sense. Wherever it is, I don't really care. Let's go."" When will the 2025 Cup schedule come out? NASCAR had hoped in May but obviously that goal has come and gone. So now the hope would be by the end of June. ""I can't say I've gotten any great feelings of where the schedule will line up next year — that's not because NASCAR is not telling us, I think they're still working through it,"" Keselowski said. ""I think they would love to tell us."" Iowa Speedway, located about 45 minutes east of Des Moines in the town of Newton, probably will be on it again. ""It's been 10 years since I've been to Iowa and raced there,"" Blaney said. ""It's a really nice racetrack. It always put on really good shows. The track was wide and racy, and it's like that unique length of racetrack that's always pretty entertaining for everybody. And it had lanes—- that's what the drivers liked about it, that character and lanes. ""The fans were really dedicated to the event and to the weekend, no matter if it was IndyCar, trucks, Xfinity whatever it was. It's good for that area.""  Keselowski echoed that sentiment when asked about Bowman Gray for the Clash. ""There's things to like about Bowman Gray — it kind of fits that billing of hitting the areas that want us,"" Keselowski said. ""I just love to schedule variability. That's so important in our sport. ""And I think you see that with events like North Wilkesboro and what you're going to see in Iowa where our fans just are overjoyed to see those events, and we should continue to embrace them.""

87,Deesha Thosar,Yankees learn valuable lessons without Juan Soto while narrowly avoiding Dodgers sweep,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/yankees-learn-valuable-lessons-without-juan-soto-while-narrowly-avoiding-dodgers-sweep,"In a series dubbed a litmus test for two title-driven teams, New York finally overcame its new star's absence Sunday — after the Dodgers exposed some of the Yankees' roster flaws.",2024-06-10T13:04:01Z,"NEW YORK — It didn't take long for the Yankees to get used to Juan Soto's bat in the lineup, but it quickly became a form of torture for their offense to operate without him. To open the first two Soto-less games of the Dodgers-Yankees series, the Bronx Bombers went 1-for-15 with runners in scoring position and left 19 men on base. Yankees fans were so tired of two straight days of nonsense from the lineup that, when backup outfielder Trent Grisham was at the plate with two outs and runners on the corners in the sixth inning Sunday, the crowd erupted into a loud ""WE WANT SOTO!"" chant. Message received.  Grisham, one pitch later, proceeded to slam a three-run home run — off Tyler Glasnow, no less — to right field, giving New York the lead for good. The Yankees defeated the Dodgers 6-4 on Sunday night in the Bronx to fend off their first sweep of the season. Message delivered. Grisham might as well have told the crowd to settle down and grow up as he rounded the bases, a straight-faced look of retribution accompanying his trot until he reached the Yankees dugout and sheepishly smiled with his teammates. The Yankees can learn something from Grisham after he loudly responded to the crowd's rude reminder that the club was missing a high-energy superstar. After the game, Grisham said intense moments like that help him get even more locked in at the plate. In his next at-bat, the crowd chanted: ""WE WANT GRISHAM!"" Having an edge goes far in the Big Apple, much further than cowering to critics. It's easy to play into the narrative that the Yankees are lost without Soto, but tougher, and much sweeter, to overcome it. The Yankees will need every player on their 26-man roster to handle difficult challenges in pressure-packed situations the way Grisham did Sunday, and the way the team captain does on a nightly basis, to get where they want to go.  ""Grisham works his butt off every single day,"" Aaron Judge said in response to the crowd's Soto-inspired chant. ""Soto is out right now, he's going to be back soon, and he's been carrying this team all year. Anytime you go up against good teams like this and fans pay to come see us do our thing, they want to see the best out there. Soto's gonna heal up and be fine, but man, Grish is a heck of a ballplayer.  ""He showed up tonight in the big moment when we needed him. I wasn't too happy with [the chant], but I think he got his point across there with that home run."" As for another valuable lesson, Soto saw that even when he's sidelined with an injury, the team will try to pick him up. Like Judge said, Soto has carried the Yankees all season. His 4.1 fWAR is in the league's top three, and his case to capture his first MVP award only gained traction this weekend. Soto had played in every Yankees game prior to Friday night versus the Dodgers. As timing would have it, he was diagnosed with left forearm inflammation hours before first pitch. The Yankees said it was good news — and it was; any kind of pain that close to the elbow is concerning. Soto was able to avoid surgery (he might even dodge the injured list), and after the collective hyperventilation the fan base experienced, that's a win. Yet, his absence offered a reminder of what the Bronx looked like without Soto last year, and painted a clear picture of what the club will resemble if Hal Steinbrenner doesn't hand him a blank check as he explores free agency this offseason. The slugger spent all three games against the Dodgers on the bench. He passed the time by pacing back and forth, refilling Gerrit Cole's drink, and at one point putting his batting gloves on, suggesting he might pinch hit. It was clear he tried his best to bring the same positive energy off the field, but the look of agitation in his eyes from being unable to play told a different story. It's foreign for Soto to be a spectator. This weekend was his first time being out of the lineup since Oct. 4, 2022. He played in all 162 games last year, and the first 64 games of this season, too. We can safely assume that, in those 612 days between, something, at some point, had afflicted Soto. He plays the game hard on both sides of the ball. Baseball players, particularly the superstars who don't take days off, are all managing some level of pain as they play through the long season.  The Yankees (46-21) know that even a physically impaired Soto would've helped them win the series against the superteam Dodgers (41-26). But they played it smart, giving him time to rest and heal his forearm injury with a focus on the future of their season, rather than risk worsening his inflammation by playing in a star-studded matchup that looked and sometimes even felt like the World Series but in reality meant much less. That prudent decision by the Yankees cost them a megawatt exposure to their flaws. With Soto sidelined, slumping first baseman Anthony Rizzo moved up to fifth in the order on Friday and Saturday. He went hitless to extend his hard-to-watch June skid to 1-for-29 — Rizzo hasn't homered since May 10 — while the rest of the lineup seemed zapped of its energy and dynamic flow without Soto. Just like last year, the Yankees fell into the trap of Judge basically being their only productive hitter. Until Grisham's statement blast, Judge was responsible for driving in four of the Yankees' six runs against L.A.'s playoff-caliber pitching staff. The Yankees needed two-plus games to adjust to the absence of Soto, further underlining how important he is to the success of the club. But, after two disappointing defeats — the first arriving in extra innings, the second in the form of an embarrassing blowout — the Yankees adapted.  The third lesson from this Soto-less Dodgers series was demoting Rizzo to the bench Sunday. Boone took the well-liked veteran out of the equation and played switch-hitting Oswaldo Cabrera in the lineup instead. That decision paid off as soon as the third inning, with Cabrera leading off the frame with a solo home run off Glasnow to put the Yankees on the board.  With or without their best players on the field, the Yankees must continue making unemotional personnel decisions in order to squeeze the most production out of their roster. This weekend was a good step, by benching Rizzo, and they might soon need to address other roster vulnerabilities. There's second baseman Gleyber Torres, sporting an 83 OPS+ in his contract year. Then there's 34-year-old Giancarlo Stanton, outproducing last year's career-worst campaign (107 OPS+ compared to 86 in 2023) yet clogging up DH when hot-hitting outfield prospect Jasson Domínguez is cranking home runs in the minors like he was born ready for big-league pitching.  Championship teams are made up of quick adjustments and egoless players sharing the responsibility of winning games no matter what it takes. There are 27 outs and 26 men to get it done. In a series that was dubbed a litmus test for both teams, in the finale, the Yankees overcame the challenge and played like they might just be built to go the distance. It will take learning from valuable lessons to get there. Deesha Thosar is an MLB writer for FOX Sports. She previously covered the Mets as a beat reporter for the New York Daily News.

88,Ric Bucher,Celtics open NBA Finals with 107-89 win over Mavericks,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/celtics-open-nba-finals-107-89-win-over-mavericks,Tthe Boston Celtics powered past the Dallas Mavericks 107-89 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.,2024-06-07T03:15:44Z,"Hall of Fame center Bill Walton carved a place for himself in the Boston Celtics' rich history as a sixth man on their 1986 championship team, and in recognition of his passing 10 days ago, the team presented a heartfelt tribute Thursday night before Game 1 of this year's NBA Finals. Another 7-foot Celtic then came off the bench to begin scratching out a spot of his own. Other than the white sleeve encasing his right leg and a splayed three-point shooting stance, center Kristaps Porzingis showed no signs of the injured right calf that kept him sidelined for the last five weeks as he boosted the Celtics to a 107-89 win to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. His stat line — 20 points, six rebounds, three blocked shots — is far too modest to capture his impact on the game; he simply blew it open. Coach Joe Mazzulla, in light of Porzingis' long layoff, opted not to start him but bring him in as a sub, which he did to rousing applause at the 7:17 mark of the first quarter with Boston nursing a 12-11 lead.  Seven minutes and 17 seconds later, Porzingis and the rest of the Celtics skipped to their bench, the crowd now roaring with the lead having ballooned to 17 points, the largest first-quarter margin in Finals' history. And no one had a bigger hand in it than Porzingis, who was a terror at both ends of the floor. The Mavs wasted no time testing him and he answered every challenge. Josh Green dunk attempt? Blocked. PJ Washington driving layup? Altered.  Dallas had no more luck being aggressive with him at the other end. Green and Derrick Jones Jr., guarding Porzingis at the free-throw line, tried to get underneath him and throw him off balance — he simply shot over them. Faced with the taller Dereck Lively II, Porzingis pump-faked and drove for a dunk. The Boston lead grew as large as 29 in the second quarter, but the Mavericks did not appear fazed, whittling it down to eight with a concerted charge to open the third quarter. But a free throw by Jaylen Brown, who finished with a team-high 22 points, and a cutting dunk by Porzingis pushed the lead back to double digits and Dallas did not threaten again.

In said game, Mbappé scored twice for France, while leading the tournament with eight combined goals. While he feels that it's ""difficult"" to take pride in France's 2022 efforts and the epic World Cup final, Mbappé wants to remain focused on the present. ""I think we have to move forward,"" Mbappé said of the 2022 World Cup loss. ""Of course, we were hurt that we were close to [being] back-to-back [World Cup champions], something amazing, something historic. Everybody loved the game, exception us; we didn't love that, but it's part of the game.

The Patriots made sure his induction into the franchise's Hall of Fame was a celebration unlike it had ever thrown before. Dozens of Brady's former teammates and coaches, spanning multiple eras of Patriots history joined thousands of fans and celebrities including Jay-Z and Bon Jovi on Wednesday night to salute Brady as the 35th person to be enshrined into the team's hall.

Before Brady spoke, team owner Robert Kraft brought Brady to tears when he announced that his No. 12 would never be worn by another Patriots player. ""The No. 12 is now officially retired,"" Kraft said. Kraft also announced that a 12-foot bronze statue of Brady was being commissioned and it would be placed outside the Patriots Hall of Fame later this year. In a night that felt like a Patriots family reunion, the biggest moment was reserved before Brady's speech when he was reunited with former Patriots coach Bill Belichick. It included an extended ovation for Belichick, who parted ways with the team after the 2023 season. ""It was a tremendous honor for me to draft Tom and coach Tom for 20 years,"" Belichick told the crowd. ""Everything he brought to the team, it was really an honor for me to be involved with that."" Brady weighed in on the never-ending debate about whether he or Belichick was most responsible Patriots success during their time together. ""It wasn't me. It wasn't you. It was us,"" Brady said. ""Let me make it clear. There is no other coach I'd rather play for than Bill Belichick."" The evening began with a red carpet featuring a who's who of Brady's 20 seasons with the Patriots, including Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Randy Moss, Vince Wilfork, Drew Bledsoe and Rob Gronkowski, among others. It also included Brady's parents, Tom Sr. and Galynn Brady. The official ceremony inside Gillette Stadium was kicked off by a smoke-filled performance by rapper Jay-Z of his 2003 ""Public Service Announcement,"" which Brady used as entrance music when he'd jogged onto the field to warmup before games. On this night, Brady emerged from near the stage at the end of Jay-Z's performance, walking through the section reserved for the night's special guests before taking a seat on stage himself. There he watched video tributes from his competitors over the years, including Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, Charles Woodson and Jason Taylor. There were also video appearances by former New York Giants Michael Strahan and Eli Manning, who were booed by fans who haven't forgotten how the Giants spoiled the Patriots' bid for a perfect season with their upset in the 2007 Super Bowl. They defeated Brady and company again in the 2011 Super Bowl. Other video cameos included some of Boston's most celebrated celebrities, such as Red Sox great David Ortiz and Matt Damon. The No. 199 pick in the 2000 draft, Brady inherited the starting job in his second season in New England when Bledsoe, the former No. 1 overall pick, was injured and led the Patriots to a Super Bowl championship that year. He won five more titles over the next two decades. Back with Brady again, Bledsoe joked that Brady didn't follow the No. 1 rule as his backup. ""You were the worst backup quarterback in the history of the NFL,"" Bledsoe said. ""You never learned that when I got healthy, that you were supposed to go sit back down."" There were emotional moments. Like when some of Brady's top playmakers — Moss, Gronkowski, Julian Edelman and Wes Welker joined Brady on stage. Moss was moved to tears as the crowd showered him a two-minute ovation. Moss recalled how when he arrived in New England in 2007 he knew he had to be close to Brady. ""Put my locker beside Tom Brady's and the rest will take care of itself,"" Moss said. There were also surprise in-person guests, like Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning participating in a sit down discussion with Brady and the night's host Mike Tirico to discuss the quarterbacks' on-field clashes over the years. Manning revealed how he never counted the Patriots out when his teams faced Brady, especially when Brady had the ball with a chance to win late in games. ""I was praying on the sidelines,"" Manning said. ""I never pray on the sidelines."" Brady paid Manning compliments as well, calling him one of his best friends. He also noted how he'd followed Manning's career as a young quarterback, dating back to high school. ""There's nobody out there like Peyton Manning right now,"" Brady said. Manning even offered some of his textbook quips, drawing cheers from what was often a hostile New England crowd when he lamented, ""They like me here because I always lost here."" In front of a crowd spilling with his No. 12 jersey, Brady said his family and the Patriots will be forever intertwined. ""I feel like we're still the family that's trying to love each other,"" Brady said. ""We're adopted New Englanders."" At one point Brady ran down the list of towns he'd lived in around New England during his time with the Patriots, from Franklin to Quincy to Chestnut Hill to Brookline. Brady concluded his speech welling with tears. ""I am Tom Brady. And I am a Patriot,"" he said. Reporting by The Associated Press."

UEFA had already announced last month that it would do more to explain decisions to teams, requiring in turn that only captains can approach the referees to discuss them. And that was emphasized on Wednesday at a media briefing on refereeing guidelines for Euro 2024 that took place at Munich’s Allianz Arena, two days before host nation Germany kicks off the tournament in the same venue against Scotland. ""Only the captain will approach the referee, the other players they have to think about [playing]. That’s it, finish,"" UEFA managing director for refereeing Roberto Rosetti said. UEFA has promised that the referees will attempt to give the captains an explanation of key incidents during the match, including what was discussed with VAR. Any teammate ignoring his captain’s role and approaching the referee showing any sign of disrespect or dissent will receive a yellow card. Fans, meanwhile, will also get a better understanding of VAR decisions as they will be broadcast on the giant screens in stadiums. ""This is something new. I think it’s very, very, very interesting,"" Rosetti said. ""So we want to give, after the opinion of VAR, a technical explanation for the public. In live, simultaneously, the UEFA expert will prepare the explanation, a technical explanation about what happened in the specific situation. ""For example, on-field review, the referee awards a penalty for handball…technical explanation: Germany number nine touch the ball with his left arm which was in an unnatural position above the shoulder and making his body bigger."" Rosetti has met with all the teams participating at Euro 2024 and their coaches to present the refereeing guidelines for the tournament, including hammering home that any dangerous tackles will be severely punished. ""One of the most important priority in refereeing guidelines is to protect the players,"" Rosetti said. ""To protect the image of the game, but in particular to protect the safety of the main actors of the games. ""We showed them a couple of clips that we are asking to the referees to be very strong in these kind of situations,"" he added. ""So for such situations we asked to the referees to be zero tolerant because this is something that we cannot accept."" Reporting by The Associated Press.

92,,2024 NFL Odds: Should Cowboys' Micah Parsons be DPOY frontrunner?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/2024-nfl-odds-should-cowboys-micah-parsons-dpoy-frontrunner,Is Micah Parsons a worthy frontrunner for Defensive Player of the Year? Keyshawn Johnson explains why he believes a few defensive backs should be higher on the odds leaderboard.,2024-06-12T01:32:42Z,"Micah Parsons has yet to win the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award. The Dallas Cowboys' dynamic linebacker has a trophy case that is brimming with accolades, including multiple Pro Bowls, two First-team All-Pro awards, and an NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award. But despite finishing second in DPOY voting twice, he has not quite been able to get over the hump to finish as the league's top vote-getter. Could this year be the charm for him?  Parsons is currently the favorite to win the award at +600 at FanDuel Sportsbook.  His status as a favorite to win the award did not surprise Keyshawn Johnson of ""Undisputed,"" but the absence of other respected names in the game did. ""He's either near the top, around, hovering every single year for the last few years going into the preseason,"" Johnson said Tuesday. ""Micah has always been in that conversation about Defensive Player of the Year during the preseason, so I'm not surprised at all. What I am surprised [about] is guys like Patrick Surtain II [from the Denver Broncos] and Kyle Hamilton from the Baltimore Ravens aren't in the conversation at the top."" Here's the full list of favorites to win 2024 NFL Defensive Player of the Year from FanDuel Sportsbook. Micah Parsons, Cowboys: +600 (bet $10 to win $70 total)Myles Garrett, Browns: +650 (bet $10 to win $75 total)T.J. Watt, Steelers: +800 (bet $10 to win $90 total)Nick Bosa, 49ers: +850 (bet $10 to win $95 total)Maxx Crosby, Raiders: +1000 (bet $10 to win $110 total)Aidan Hutchinson, Lions: +1600 (bet $10 to win $170 total)Chris Jones, Chiefs: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)Josh Allen, Jaguars: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)Will Anderson Jr., Texans: +2600 (bet $10 to win $270 total)Danielle Hunter, Texans: +2600 (bet $10 to win $270 total) * odds as of 6/11/24 For Johnson, who matched up with plenty of top-tier defensive backs during his decade-long career as an NFL receiver, the position group's absence pointed to a larger theme of defensive generally being absent from the award's finalist tally. ""For whatever reason,"" Johnson said, ""we are so quick to point out the defensive linemen, the pass rushers. Whether it's a Maxx Crosby, or a Myles Garrett, or Nick Bosa or T.J. Watt or some of those guys, and I think it's a disservice to the award itself. … When I think about guys like Surtain, you say to yourself they don't really get statistically the notoriety over a guy who gets sacks, because what are we looking for in the defensive backfield? Interceptions.  ""Well, if you ain't throwing the ball on that side, or everything he's doing is running shallow crosses and not really coming at me, and I can't get the opportunities to put my hands on the ball, I'm not gonna get the sexy numbers. Whereas a pass-rusher can come off the edge scot-free, nobody's blocking him, and he gets a sack-fumble."" In comparison to the leaders, Surtain is currently listed at +7500 to win the award while Hamilton is listed at +5000, the shortest DPOY odds of any NFL defensive back. Corners and safeties have scarcely been recipients over the years, as just 10 defensive have won the DPOY since 1971. Stephon Gilmore was the last winner while with the New England Patriots in 2019. And if the odds are any idication, that trend seems set to continue in 2024. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

""Man, I feel the fountain of youth,"" Wilson told reporters after Steelers' first mandatory minicamp, via ESPN. ""I feel revived in every way, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I feel confident. I think at some point you have to know who you are as a player, as a man, as a competitor. As somebody who's been fortunate to be able to play this game, I don't doubt it. I trust it. I felt really good last year playing. I felt really confident in the midst of everything. And so I think right now I have all that confidence times 10."" Wilson's two-year tenure with the Broncos ended in an 11-19 record and a failure to make the playoffs. He was controversially benched with two games left in the 2023 season after reportedly refusing to restructure his contract and then released in March, after the season ended. The Broncos are eating nearly $86 million in dead money against the salary cap as part of releasing him. Yet Wilson remains the favorite to be the Steelers' starting quarterback in Week 1 of the 2024 season, new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith confirmed to reporters Tuesday. Wilson is facing competition from fellow new arrival Justin Fields, the former Chicago Bears starting quarterback who arrived in Pittsburgh via trade last spring. The Steelers have struggled with inconsistent quarterback play since the retirement of Ben Rothliesberger after the 2021 season. They still made the playoffs last season but lost in the wild-card round to the Buffalo Bills with Mason Rudolph starting under center. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

94,,DK Metcalf excited for Seahawks future with Mike Macdonald but thankful for Pete Carroll,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/dk-metcalf-excited-for-seahawks-future-with-mike-macdonald-thankful-for-time-with-pete-carroll,"DK Metcalf was present for the start of the Seattle Seahawks minicamp after spending the majority of the offseason program away from the team, and praised his former head coach Pete Carroll.",2024-06-12T02:12:10Z,"DK Metcalf has one issue with his new coach in Seattle, Mike Macdonald. ""He’s a defensive coach. That’s one thing I don’t like about him,"" Metcalf joked. ""But it’s good for our team."" Seattle’s star wide receiver was present for the start of mandatory minicamp on Tuesday after being around for only a limited time during the voluntary portion of the offseason program. And while he’s excited about the direction of the team under Macdonald, it also wasn’t easy for Metcalf to accept the dismissal of Pete Carroll after last season, the only coach he had played for in the NFL. ""I love Pete. He’s the reason that I’m standing right here in front of you all, along with [general manager] John [Schneider],"" Metcalf said. ""He was a great coach for me, can’t dismiss what he did for me in this organization, before I got here and when I got here. He’s a great coach, a Hall of Fame-caliber coach in my opinion. Just sad to see somebody lose their job like that."" The start of Seattle’s mandatory minicamp this week was the first time Metcalf had addressed Carroll being let go after last season following 14 years in charge of the Seahawks. Metcalf and Carroll had a strong relationship, going back to when they met at the NFL combine before the 2019 draft when the Seahawks eventually selected the wide receiver in the second round with the 64th overall pick. ""I’ve had conversations with him since then. He’s doing good and that’s all I can do is just keep in contact with him because he gave me an opportunity to play in this league,"" Metcalf said. While the connection with Carroll is part of his past, the future for Metcalf could be even more productive than it has been. Metcalf raved about the system of new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb and what that could mean for Seattle’s trio of talented wide receivers — Metcalf, Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. ""Every offense that I’ve played in from Schotty (Brian Schottenheimer) to Shane (Waldron) to now, they all have their unique variations, but I like the way Grubb’s offense is very explosive and he tries to push the ball downfield,"" Metcalf said. Metcalf was also complimentary of Macdonald. Even in his limited time around the team this offseason, Metcalf said he was impressed with Macdonald’s approach. ""He’s not trying to copy anything that anybody’s done in the past. He’s just bringing Mike Macdonald to the Seattle Seahawks,"" Metcalf said. For his part, Macdonald seemed equally impressed with Metcalf, who last season averaged a career-high 16.9 yards per catch and caught eight TDs. ""The way he practices is really awesome. This guy practices extremely hard. Does all the little things that you’re asking him to do,"" Macdonald said. ""So it’s a great example that he’s setting for that room and really for our offense as a whole."" Reporting by The Associated Press. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

95,Bob Pockrass,"Dale Earnhardt Jr. 1-on-1: On future racing plans, Cup ownership possibilities",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/dale-earnhardt-jr-future-racing-plans-cup-ownership-possibilities,Dale Earnhardt Jr. discusses why he plans on racing late models for a long time and why owning a Cup charter might not be in the cards.,2024-06-13T15:29:56Z,"Fans are used to seeing Dale Earnhardt Jr. as part of the NBC telecasts, which begin this weekend at Iowa Speedway. But Earnhardt — by far NASCAR’s most popular driver during his years in the sport — is not returning to the NBC booth this year. He returns next season for 10 races (points races 13-22 on the Cup schedule), five on Amazon Prime Video and five on TNT. So how is Earnhardt spending his time this summer? FOX Sports caught up with Earnhardt — media personality, businessman, and co-owner of JR Motorsports — at JRM’s fan day last month to find out what he is doing, what he thinks of the short-track package (the next two races are at the 0.875-mile Iowa and 1-mile New Hampshire), how much longer he will do a race or two in the Xfinity Series and whether JR Motorsports will ever go Cup racing. I figure people are wondering what in the world is Dale Earnhardt Jr. doing since he’s not in the booth this year. So what are you doing? What am I doing? Well, this year I turn 50 in October, so I've been traveling a lot. I went to Europe to hang out with Jimmie Johnson and Casey Mears and Matt Kenseth and all our wives. We had a good little trip. We’re probably going to go back to Europe later in the year. We’ve got a few trips planned. We're tuning in — we're watching all the races trying to stay on top of what's going on in the sport. We're still doing all of our Dirty Mo’ Media podcasting. And we're here at JR Motorsports every week creating all our content for that. I’m racing our little late model car here and there. I'm going to run the Xfinity car at Bristol again this year, just like we did last year with Hellmann’s, and then I'm running three-to-five late model stock races in the CARS Tour and the Advanced Auto Parts weekly series that NASCAR has. It’s all really a lot of fun. I am missing the broadcast. I know NBC hasn't started this year, and that's going to be tough to tune in and see those guys and not be there with them because I've grown so comfortable working with all of the folks at NBC and certainly my friends in the booth. And so that'll be a little tough once that gets started. But otherwise, we announced our deal with Amazon and TNT, so we're starting to already have the meetings about what we want in our broadcast and what we want it to look like. We haven't finished building the booth yet. ... As soon as we get the booth built, we're going to start doing some mock runs, basically get in a room and pretend to broadcast the actual race that maybe NBC or FOX is doing. So looking forward to that because I'm anxious to get some good chemistry going on with whoever's in the booth with me because we've got five races to get it right. We want to be right straight out of the gate with Amazon and TNT. So it’d be good to get some practice runs going. A lot to do, a lot to keep me busy. We talked about the racing that you're going to do. I know that I've heard you say that at some point, you're not going to be racing anymore. Do you know when that is or do you feel good for a couple Xfinity races a year? I want to run my late model for a really long time. I imagine when I get to around 60, I'll be probably considering that that's probably too old to be out there battling with some of these younger guys. So I’ve got about a 10-year runway to do everything I want to do with my late model. The Xfinity car? Every year, I say that — personally but I don't really share this publicly — but every year, I pretty much feel like it could be my last. I'm going into this race at Bristol this year knowing that it might be the last one I run. There’s nothing that really makes that decision. It’s just last year was a lot of fun, led some laps. But it is a big commitment. I just logged in the calendar the sim that I'm going to be doing to try to prepare for that. And we do a lot of promotion around the partnership with Hellmann's around that race. And so it's not just show up and race and, ""Oh man, that was great. We'll do it again next year."" There's a lot of work that goes into it months ahead of time. But as long as we're running good like we did — we ran so much better than I thought we would at Bristol last year — and as long as that's happening, I think I'll always want to keep coming back. When you go out there and you know the car is good and you just aren't able to produce the result, then it's probably time to let somebody else try it. Cup is racing at Iowa for the first time. The short-track package has been a struggle. When you're watching short tracks, what are you hoping for the most these days? I think we're learning a lot. I've been very critical of the short track package on my own content, Dirty Mo’ Media, ""The Dale Jr. Download."" And fans have been critical, and everybody wants NASCAR to get it right and everybody's got a different opinion, myself included — it’s the car, it's this, it’s that and the other. But I think where we've kind of landed, at least it seems at the moment, is that we can certainly learn a lot by messing with a tire and Goodyear seems to be willing to be a bit aggressive with the tire. We didn't get the desired result that we were looking for [with the softer tire] at the all-star race at North Wilkesboro. We didn't get that desired result with the different tire combinations. But they did learn from it. And I think the drivers are open-minded and have given a lot of great input and feedback on what they're feeling with the tires as they start to change the compound. And so I'm hoping that Goodyear can continue race by race to push the envelope on a softer compound and a tire that will give us the racing that we want. And honestly, man, I really thought that the all-star race was a really great step in the right direction. We saw a brand new repave that was multi-groove. We've never seen that before and as many years as I can remember, a repaved racetrack that put on such great racing. I know it's hard to pass, but it's supposed to be hard to pass. It's never not going to be hard to pass, I can promise you that. The only time it's not hard to pass is when you're at the superspeedways and you can get a draft and get around somebody. But everywhere else, it should be hard to pass. And so we're always going to be arguing over how much of hard-to-pass can we put up with. Any time you have multi-grooves like we had at Wilkesboro, that's a great thing. Hopefully, we continue to see that develop as we go further along the schedule and racing at these short tracks throughout the rest of the year [and] Goodyear continuing to push the tire and get more aggressive with the tire. Because I don't think the tracks are broken. And I don't really necessarily believe the car is broken. They’ve tried everything with this car. They've stripped the downforce away. They've done all the things they can do at the test. The drivers feel nothing when they're making these changes. So I'm not 100 percent sold that the car is the problem. If you're going on vacation, I guess that means no charter negotiations for you? We’re out of the charter business right now. ... The sale of a charter, I would call it a cycle, right? Well, we missed this last cycle. We'll see what comes down the road. I'm almost feeling like that if I were to ever get involved in the Cup side, it would be like an investment — my personal monetary investment in something current. I would be open to talking to team owners about putting money into a particular singular charter and saying, ""Hey, I'm going to park an investment here in this charter. I'm leaving that for my generations down the road, my girls and what have you."" It wouldn't be anything other than that. So I don't know if we'll ever have JR Motorsports physically owning charters, running a race team operating every facet of that. I think that that ship has sailed.

96,Rowan Kavner,"As Corey Seager makes memorable L.A. return, Dodgers still figuring out future at SS",https://www.foxsports.com/stories/mlb/corey-seager-makes-memorable-l-a-return-dodgers-still-figuring-out-future-ss,"Three years after two-time World Series MVP Corey Seager's departure, the Dodgers are still searching for their long-term answer at shortstop — and their 2020 championship form.",2024-06-13T14:09:04Z,"LOS ANGELES — Corey Seager wore a dark blue shirt as he walked into the Dodger Stadium interview room Tuesday afternoon and sat down in front of a blue and white L.A. backdrop, as he had done so many times before,  The only difference? That shirt now reads ""Texas Rangers"" on the front. For the first time since he left the Dodgers after the 2021 season, Seager returned to Dodger Stadium this week for a regular-season series. He had been back before, in 2022 for the All-Star Game, but that game, Seager explained, included every team's fans. This felt different.  This was the first time he returned to a stadium full of Dodgers fans, the ones who celebrated his many triumphs while watching him grow from a first-round pick in 2012 to the postseason star of a 2020 team that ended the club's 32-year championship drought. Those fans expressed their appreciation again before Tuesday's game, giving Seager a standing ovation after a montage of his accomplishments played on the DodgerVision video boards.  ""This organization kind of raised me,"" Seager said. ""Drafted here, kind of made me the man I am today, taught me the game of baseball, made a lot of friends, made a lot of buddies, had a lot of good times out there. All those memories kind of flash back as you're pulling in."" Soon, however, the warm welcome would turn into a smattering of boos.  After sitting out of Tuesday's series opener due to a lingering hamstring issue, Seager made his presence felt Wednesday in his official return to Dodger Stadium with a three-run home run off former teammate Walker Buehler that made the difference in a Rangers win and provided a reminder of his prestigious past.  Seager, who understood the reaction from the conflicted home crowd, was a Rookie of the Year for the Dodgers in 2016 and an All-Star in 2016 and 2017. But it was three years later, during the 2020 pandemic-shortened season, when he cemented his place in franchise lore, winning both National League Championship Series and World Series MVP honors while delivering one of the all-time great postseason performances.  ""I think the best I've ever seen was David Ortiz in 2004,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said, ""but that ‘20 postseason for Corey was right up there with him.""  Two years later, Seager was off to Texas, leaving a revolving door of temporary solutions at shortstop and back-to-back early playoff exits in his wake.  The Dodgers expressed interest in keeping him long term but saw the writing on the wall as his contract year progressed. On Tuesday, Seager was asked if he thought his time in Los Angeles was over after he turned down the Dodgers' extension offer in the spring of 2021 or if he was still hoping he could work something out at that point.  ""You're always hopeful,"" Seager said. He otherwise had little interest in rehashing the past.  ""But that's a long time ago,"" he continued. ""I can't really remember how it went. Sorry, I don't want to go down that path.""  The Dodgers planned for both the present and future at the 2021 deadline when they traded for Max Scherzer and Trea Turner. Scherzer was a rental that year, but Turner was under team control for another season. He shifted to second base to finish out the year, playing alongside Seager, then assumed full-time shortstop duties in Los Angeles in 2022 after the Dodgers failed to meet the market price that winter for Seager, who was enticed by the pitch from Rangers general manager Chris Young.  ""Listening to CY's plan and kind of how he thought it would go and the players that they had and how he thought they would develop, he did an extremely good job,"" Seager recalled.  Of course, the Rangers' 10-year, $325 million offer didn't hurt, either.   Texas was coming off a 102-loss season at the time and envisioned Seager and Marcus Semien as the new offensive centerpieces. The Rangers' decision came with considerable risk.  At 6-foot-4, Seager possesses a bigger frame than the typical shortstop, and he had played in just 307 games over his final four years in Los Angeles, most notably missing time due to Tommy John and hip surgeries in 2018. In addition, his superb 2020 postseason — during which he hit seven home runs between the NLCS and World Series — came after he produced a .390 OPS in the 2019 National League Division Series and before he hit .188 during the 2021 postseason.  But the Rangers envisioned the upside and were rewarded for their belief. In his second year in Texas, Seager helped turn the club into champions.  ""I don't know if you ever thought it'd be that fast,"" Seager said. ""Just kind of clicked at the right time and got hot in the playoffs, and it turns into that. But that was his plan."" The Dodgers' plan, meanwhile, did not yield the same result.  Turner was an All-Star in 2022. He won the batting title and became the only Dodgers shortstop ever to log 20 homers, 20 stolen bases, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in a single season. In the midst of his production, he entertained the idea of playing in Los Angeles long term. The Dodgers did not. They never made him a formal extension offer.  After a shocking first-round exit at the hands of the Padres, they let Turner go to Philadelphia, watching another $300 million shortstop find a new home.  ""I thought they would be on me,"" Turner said. ""They weren't.""  Months after their postseason run fizzled out, the Dodgers' follow-up plans at shortstop did, too.  Former top prospect Gavin Lux was supposed to be the answer at the position last season, but he tore his ACL in a Cactus League game. Miguel Rojas, who was signed to help in a utility role, stepped into primary duties at the spot. While starting pitching ultimately failed the Dodgers in October, their offense also cratered in a stunning first-round sweep at the hands of the Diamondbacks.  Seager, meanwhile, returned to the pinnacle.  The Rangers shortstop joined Reggie Jackson as the only two players to win World Series MVP honors with two different teams.  ""Any time you win, they're fun,"" Seager said as he reflected on his two championships — one during a 60-game season with cardboard cutouts in the crowd, the other in more typical fashion. ""To be at the top is what you're always trying to accomplish, so in a lot of ways there were a lot of similarities. How you get there, things like that, might be different. But in the end, winning is the same."" The Dodgers spent $1.2 billion this offseason trying to recapture that feeling. None of those funds went toward finding a new shortstop.  This year was supposed to be Lux's second chance, but his spring struggles defensively at the position led to a quick change. For a team typically well-equipped and prepared to handle any possibility, their lack of options and ultimate decision both came as a surprise. They bumped Lux over to second base and gave the shortstop duties to Mookie Betts, who last year split most of his time between the outfield and second base and was initially expected to stick to the latter spot in 2024.  Prior to logging 13 starts at shortstop last season, Betts had never played an inning at the premium position as a major-leaguer and hadn't manned the spot professionally in a decade.  Seager, who still keeps in touch with Betts, is one of multiple opposing shortstops who have expressed both awe and amazement at the six-time Gold Glove Award-winning right fielder's dynamism on a baseball field and willingness to learn the position on the fly at the highest level.  ""He's a special player,"" Seager said. ""Everybody knows that. Special athlete. His ability to play all over the place at such a high level and still be able to compete in the batter's box, it's impressive to watch."" To Betts' credit, he has played the position competently through painstaking preparation — including hours of pregame work taking grounders on a nightly basis — and is in the midst of an MVP-caliber season, though advanced metrics are split on his defensive effectiveness. By defensive runs saved, he has been a top-10 player at the position. By outs above average, which takes into account where a defender is positioned and how far he has to go to make a play, he ranks at the bottom.  Last month, Betts evaluated his performance so far as ""not very good"" and ""a work in progress"" while expressing the difficulty of the challenge.  ""There's no way to really speed it up, and as bad as I want to, as bad as I want to be good at it, it's hard,"" Betts said. ""It's hard for everyone, and I just started doing it, so experience is going to be the only thing that's really going to teach me.""  For now, the Dodgers appear poised to give him every opportunity to learn. Their comfortable division lead affords them that latitude, though it's a precarious and uncertain position — for the remainder of this season and beyond — for a championship contender that recently employed two of the game's top shortstop talents. One of those players spent Monday in nearby Manhattan Beach. Seager used his off day to meet up with Dodgers outfielder Chris Taylor — just one example of the lifelong friendships and bonds Seager and his wife, Mady, have created with his former teammates and their families in Los Angeles.  In the time since Seager left L.A., Taylor got married and welcomed a baby boy. For Seager, who said it feels strange that he's already in his third season in Texas, it's mostly off the field where he senses how much time has passed.  For the Dodgers, who have one playoff win since Seager's departure and have seen a different player manning shortstop in each subsequent season, the passage of time might feel more pronounced.  ""He and his representation got a deal that they couldn't refuse, and he and Mady are happy over there,"" Roberts said. ""Obviously, any team is better with Corey Seager.""  Rowan Kavner is an MLB writer for FOX Sports. He previously covered the L.A. Dodgers, LA Clippers and Dallas Cowboys.

97,,Most successful first-year coaches in Michigan history: Can Sherrone Moore be next?,https://www.foxsports.com/stories/college-football/most-successful-first-year-coaches-michigan-history-can-sherrone-moore-next,"Sherrone Moore joined ""The Joel Klatt Show: Big Noon Conversations"" to discuss expectations in his first season. Here's a look at the most successful seasons for first-year coaches at Michigan.",2024-06-12T19:02:25Z,"Sherrone Moore is entering a unique situation in his first season as the head coach of Michigan. The first-year coach is taking over a national championship-winning squad, becoming the first Division I college football head coach to do that since Frank Solich replaced Tom Osborn at Nebraska in 1998. He replaces Jim Harbaugh, who oversaw a Michigan team that went 40-3 over the last three years, and will oversee a Wolverines squad that lost the majority of its leaders and key contributors from last season. As expectations and pressure mount on Moore, he won't let any of that get to him. ""It doesn't weigh on me that much,"" Moore said on ""The Joel Klatt Show: Big Noon Conversations."" ""I mean, I think about it, but I'm not going to let it put pressure on me. I just want to get better every day. That's it. Just work on this process. ""We talk about that still with the players. I'm not going to let it drain me or try to think about that too much. I'm just going to try to work, trying to get better at what I can do every single day to make this team the best they can."" [Sherrone Moore reveals promise Jim Harbaugh made before becoming Michigan's coach] So, what would it take for Moore's first season as Michigan's head coach to be considered a success?  Let's take a look at the 10 most successful seasons for a first-year coach in Michigan football history.  Record: 9-4 (.692) Big Ten record: 5-3 (.625)Bowl result: Loss to Texas A&M in Alamo BowlCareer record at Michigan: 122-40 Carr became the head coach of the Wolverines in May 1995, replacing Gary Moeller, who resigned following his arrest at a Michigan restaurant.  After serving as Moeller's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator for five seasons, Carr's first season was consistent with his predecessor's tenure. The Wolverines were one of the best teams in the Big Ten, but they fell short of national championship contention. Carr's Michigan squad lost at home against eventual Big Ten champion Northwestern before losing at Michigan State and at No. 19 Penn State. But Carr ended the regular season on a high note, beating undefeated No. 2 Ohio State at home, 31-23, preventing its top rival from a Big Ten title. The 1995 season was the start of one of the best head coaching tenures in Michigan history. Carr led Michigan to a national title in his third season as the Wolverines won at least eight games in all but one season in his time as their head coach. Record: 8-3 (.727)Big Ten record: 6-1 (.857)Bowl result: Loss to USC in Rose BowlCareer record at Michigan: 194–48–5 Schembechler ushered in one of the best eras in the program's history after being hired in 1969. While Michigan had a pair of decisive losses against Missouri and Michigan State early in the season, the team was dominant for much of Big Ten play. It upset ninth-ranked Purdue before beating No. 1 Ohio State in its regular-season finale, clinching a share of the Big Ten title and a berth to the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines won at least nine games in 15 of Schembechler's 21 seasons as head coach, making the Rose Bowl eight more times after his first season. Record: 9-3 (.750)Big Ten record: 6-2Bowl result: Win over Ole Miss in Gator BowlCareer record at Michigan: 44-13-3 After serving as Schembechler's offensive coordinator for the previous three seasons, Moeller had some early struggles in his first season as the head man.  Michigan lost a close battle to No. 1 Notre Dame in South Bend to open Moeller's tenure. After three straight wins propelled the Wolverines to the No. 1 ranking in the country, they lost back-to-back games at home against Michigan State and Iowa to drop to 20th in the Associated Press poll. Moeller's team found its groove after that, defeating No. 19 Ohio State in Columbus, 16-13, before demolishing 15th-ranked Ole Miss, 35-3, in the Gator Bowl to finish the season ranked seventh. Moeller led Michigan to two top-six finishes in the following two seasons before a pair of consecutive 8-4 seasons prior to his resignation in May 1995. Record: 6-1-1 (.750)Big Ten record: 3-1-1Bowl result: Didn't play in a bowl gameCareer record at Michigan: 71-16-3 Crisler immediately turned the Wolverines around after Harry Kipke struggled in his last four seasons as head coach, going 10-22 over that stretch. While Crisler wasn't able to end Michigan's four-game losing streak to Minnesota, he ended its four-game losing streak to its other top rivals: Michigan State and Ohio State. He led Michigan to a 14-0 win over Michigan State in his debut before recording an 18-0 win over Ohio State on the road.  Michigan slowly got better over Crisler's 10-year career in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines finished ranked in the top 10 in his last eight seasons with the program before going 10-0 to win a national title in his last season. Record: 6-2 (.750)Big Ten record: 3-2Bowl result: Didn't play in a bowl gameCareer record at Michigan: 9-6-1 Wieman led Michigan to a pair of 21-0 wins against its top rivals, Michigan State and Ohio State. However, the Wolverines ended the season with a loss against Minnesota to lose the Big Ten title.  Michigan went 3-4-1 in the following season and Wieman was ousted as the school's head coach due to his reported tension with athletic director Fielding H. Yost.  Record: 6-2 (.750)Big Ten record: 4-2Bowl result: Didn't play in a bowl gameCareer record at Michigan: 6-2 Little had a one-year stint as Michigan's head coach after he succeeded Yost. He led Michigan to wins against its top rivals at the time, defeating Minnesota, 13-0, and Ohio State, 16-6. But the Wolverines weren't able to overcome a 39-14 loss to Illinois in order to win the Big Ten title. Little left Ann Arbor on his own accord at the end of the season, departing for Wisconsin to be its head coach and the school's athletic director. Record: 10-3 (.769)Big Ten record: 6-2Bowl result: Win over Florida in the Citrus BowlCareer record at Michigan: 86-25 After Michigan went 5-7 in 2014, Harbaugh turned the Wolverines into a 10-win team and one of the best in the Big Ten. While he lost to Utah to open his Michigan tenure, Harbaugh quickly put together a five-game winning streak. But that ended with a brutal loss at home against Michigan State, when Michigan botched the snap on a punt on the game's final play that led to a Spartans touchdown. Harbaugh led Michigan to a four-game win streak after that, but his team got blown out at home against Ohio State, marking the first of five straight losses for him against the school's top rival. Harbaugh eventually got his revenge against Ohio State, defeating the Buckeyes three straight times in his final three seasons with the program. Of course, Harbaugh led Michigan to a title in his final season with the program. Record: 11-2 (.846)Big Ten record: 6-2Bowl result: Win over Virginia Tech in the Sugar BowlCareer record at Michigan: 31-20 The start of the Brady Hoke era in Ann Arbor showed great promise. Michigan got out to a 6-0 start under Hoke before losing to rival Michigan State and Iowa over a three-week span. Those were the only blemishes though in the season, as the Wolverines defeated Ohio State, 40-34, to pick up their first win over their archrival since 2003.  The loss to Michigan State ultimately got in the way of Michigan playing in the first-ever Big Ten Championship Game. Still, Michigan found itself in a BCS Bowl, defeating Virginia Tech in overtime in the Sugar Bowl.  Hoke's time in Ann Arbor got worse with each season after Year 1, bottoming out with a five-win year in 2014 before being fired. Record: 9-0 (1.000)Big Ten record: 6-0Bowl result: Didn't play in a bowl gameCareer record at Michigan: 63-33-4 Oosterbaan is one of two Michigan coaches to lead the Wolverines to an undefeated season in his first year at the helm. The Michigan icon, who played for the program and also coached the school's basketball team, coached the Wolverines to a dominant season en route to being named a consensus national champion in 1948. They shut out five of their opponents, allowing just 44 points all season long. They scored at least 27 points six times.  However, not everyone was immediately impressed with Oosterbaan. After a 13-7 win over Michigan State, the New York Times wrote that the team ""lacked most of the precision"" Michigan had from its national title-winning squad a year prior. Michigan closed out its season with a 13-3 win over Ohio State. That ended up being the high mark of Oosterbaan's time as Michigan's head coach though, failing to win more than seven games in a single season after that. Record: 11-0 (1.000)Big Ten record: 4-0Bowl result: Defeated Stanford in the Rose BowlCareer record at Michigan: 165-29-10 Yost began his dominance in Ann Arbor the moment he stepped on campus. Michigan ran right through its schedule in 1901, beginning the ""Point-a-Minute"" era by putting up record-scoring numbers. The Wolverines scored at least 50 points in a game five times, including an 89-0 win and a 128-0 win. Additionally, Michigan shut out every opponent that season en route to beating Stanford, 49-0, in the first-ever college football bowl game.  The 1901 season was the first of four straight national title seasons for Michigan and the first of Yost's six national titles as head coach in Ann Arbor. Michigan would, presumably, need to win at least nine games in 2024 in order for Moore to crack the top 10 of this list. Unless Michigan nosedives in Year 1 of the Moore era, it'll almost certainly play at least 13 games (12 regular-season, at least one postseason).  Nine wins could also get Michigan into the College Football Playoff as the field expands to 12 teams in 2024. Michigan suddenly turned into a perennial contender in Harbaugh's final three seasons with the program. If Moore can build on that success after the team lost a program-record 13 draft picks, this season would almost certainly be viewed as a success.  But the path to nine wins might be more difficult in 2024 than it's ever been in Michigan's history. With the Big Ten expanding to 18 teams, Michigan will have games against USC, Oregon and Washington, who are all conference foes now. Michigan also takes on Texas, who's expected to be ranked in the preseason top five, in a non-conference battle in Week 2. More importantly, Ohio State appears to have its best roster in the Ryan Day era. The Buckeyes were the No. 1-ranked team in FOX Sports national college football analyst RJ Young's post-spring top 25 rankings. They hold the second-best odds (+450) to win the national title heading into the 2024 campaign. So, even if Michigan doesn't win nine games in 2024, it would almost certainly take some solace in Moore beating Ohio State. History is on his side, with first-year Michigan coaches going 10-3 all-time against Ohio State. Oh, and Moore already has a win over Ohio State, leading Michigan to a dramatic 27-24 win last year during his interim stint. [Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?
