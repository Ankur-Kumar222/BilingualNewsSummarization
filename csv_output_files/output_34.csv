The Three Lions have been rewarded with the tagline of bookies favourites to win the competition as reward for a golden generation of footballing talent. Boss Gareth Southgate is expected to steer his side over the line in Germany after falling short in the final at Wembley three years ago. With a squad packed full of young talent much of the discourse in recent days has been around the players Southgate has left behind ahead of the tournament. Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford are two of the big names to have been axed from the squad while eyebrows were raised at the omission of James Maddison and Everton starlet Jarrad Branthwaite. England’s youthful 26-man squad arrived in Germany on Monday night ready for the challenge of winning a first ever European Championship. But before thoughts turn to a second-successive final in Berlin on July 14, the Three Lions face a tough group with dark horses Serbia up first before meetings with Denmark and Slovenia. Ahead of Sunday’s opener, we predict England’s starting XI to take on Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. The Everton shot-stopper is England’s undisputed number one and a shoe-in to start against Serbia. The 30-year-old will play in his fourth-consecutive major tournament with England having been thrust into the senior squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The Manchester City full-back will be a key component of Southgate’s backline in Germany. His inclusion could see him utilised at centre-back at times with England light in central defence. Walker’s experience will be vital for Southgate, particularly if England go deep in the competition. Doubts remain over the fitness of Stones who was replaced at half time of England’s 1-0 defeat to Iceland on Friday. Brighton’s Lewis Dunk will be on standby should Stones be deemed unfit to start the match.  Meanwhile, Guehi will get his first taste of senior tournament football but will need to show he is more than a match for a tall and physical Serbia outfit.  The Newcastle star has had an indifferent season but his experience of tournament football will be a huge bonus for the Three Lions.  Trippier is likely to fill in for Luke Shaw who continues his recovery from injury. Shaw, who has not played a competitive match since February 18, has made the squad but England legend Stuart Pearce believes his unavailability is a problem for Southgate. “I’ve been saying for months, if Luke doesn’t make it we’ve got a big problem because he gives us natural balance defensively but he gives us balance going forward as well,” Pearce told talkSPORT. He is so vital to us.  “The question is, if he’s fit for the second game would you put him in? The other side to that is if you don't, where is he going to get his fitness from for the knockout stages?” For many, it represents the dream midfield trio. Bellingham has joined up with the Three Lions following his heroics in helping guide Real Madrid to Champions League glory earlier this month. Declan Rice has enjoyed a superb season with Arsenal and is expected to take up a deeper role alongside Alexander-Arnold with Bellingham starting out in a more advanced position. Despite playing the majority of the season as right-back under Jurgen Klopp, Alexander-Arnold is expected to influence the game from midfield with his range of passing and composure in possession. Reports on Monday claim the Liverpool star is set to start in midfield on Sunday, something Pearce feels would be a logical move. “You have to have someone with a range of passing that can unlock a defence from distance and he can do that,” he added. “It would surprise me if he started [at right-back] for that reason.” Much will be expected of England skipper Kane who will be playing in a familiar surroundings after his move to Bayern Munich last summer.  England’s all-time leading scorer will be joined by Premier League Player of the Year Foden, who is yet to replicate his club form at international level. Chelsea star Palmer should deputise for Bukayo Saka should the Arsenal man continue to struggle with fitness. Saka, who has scooped England’s Player of the Year award for the past two seasons did not start either of the tune-up games against Bosnia and Iceland but concerns remain over his availability for Sunday’s clash.

England kick-off their Euro 2024 campaign on Sunday, live on talkSPORT, as they look to win the tournament for the first time ever. Southgate has travelled to Germany with his talented 26-man squad, although concerns have been raised over the defence. Manchester United left-back Shaw was called up despite missing a large chunk of the season with a muscle injury. However, fans received a boost over his fitness when Southgate confirmed that the entire team are available for selection. ""Everyone is available,"" he said during his pre-match press conference on Saturday evening. ""We have a decision whether Luke [Shaw] is a possible to use from the bench or not but everyone has trained today and is available."" Should Shaw not start from the get-go, then it is likely that Kieran Tripper will start at left-back in their Euro 2024 opener. Southgate's squad boasts a lot of experience on the big stage, with Harry Kane their captain and Kyle Walker now acting as vice. However, the England boss has also revealed that two new names have been added to their leadership group for the tournament. ""I think we have a very open relationship with all of the players. We've put a small leadership group together for this tournament with Harry, Kyle Walker, Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham.  ""There's a different dynamic to this group with a lot of younger players. I don't want to leave here with any stone unturned. I don't want to miss anything. The players have good views."" After facing Serbia, England will play Denmark and Slovenia in their remaining Group C fixtures before the knockout stages. The Three Lions suffered heartbreak in their penalty shootout defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final but are one of the favourites to go all the way this summer.
