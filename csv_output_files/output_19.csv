0,insider@insider.com (Casey Clark ),Nectar vs Tempur-Pedic: Which mattress should you choose?,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/nectar-vs-tempur-pedic-mattress-comparison,"We compare the design, comfort, and policies of the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Cloud mattress.",2024-06-08T13:00:01Z,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more  Tempur-Pedic and Nectar are two brands that come to mind when considering the best memory foam mattresses. Tempur-Pedic is often credited with pioneering foam for sleeping after building on technology created by NASA and offers a number of mattresses in mid-range and luxury price points in varying configurations to suit a wide range of sleepers. Nectar is known for its budget-friendly bed-in-a-box options and for helping popularize the yearlong sleep trial and ""forever"" warranty. We tested both the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud both of which cater to individuals of all sleeping preferences. In the last few years, Tempur-Pedic introduced its own bed-in-box, or bag, as it actually ships, in the TEMPUR-Cloud, its most economical offering and one of our favorite foam mattresses for all sleep types. The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress is an even more price-effective option that caters to side and back sleepers, and those with back pain. Read our individual reviews of the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and Tempur-Pedic Cloud mattress. Below, we compare these pressure-relieving mattresses based on factors that we rate when considering the best mattresses such as price, design, return policy, warranty, set-up process, comfort, edge support, and motion transfer to help you decide which will be the best option for your sleep habits. 
                                      The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but with a price tag coming in way under a grand.
                                     
                                      The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation.
                                     Specs Nectar Memory Foam Dreamcloud Premier Hybrid Best for All sleeping styles, hot sleepers, back pain sufferers All sleeping styles, hot sleepers, back pain sufferers Price (Queen) $649 $1,999 Sizes Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king Twin, twin long, full, queen, king, split king, Cal king Type Gel memory foam Tempur-Material Firmness (1 softest to 10 firmest) 6 6 Motion isolation (1 awful to 10 best) 8 8 Heat dissipation (1 traps heat to 10 stays cool) 7 9 Edge support (1 awful to 10 best) 7 4 Weight (queen) 65 pounds 57 pounds Thickness 12 inches 10 inches Delivery Free shipping, setup extra Free, no setup offered Trial Period policy 365 days  90 days Warranty Forever Showroom availability Yes, retail partners Yes, showrooms and partner stores The Tempur-Pedic's TEMPUR-Cloud uses its proprietary TEMPUR-Material, a responsive foam with open-cell technology that relies on an individual's own body heat to soften the material. This purportedly provides personalized comfort for different body shapes, sizes, and weights. Unlike traditional memory foam mattresses, it doesn't cause you to feel trapped and overheat during the night. In terms of construction, the 10-inch TEMPUR-Cloud has a moisture-wicking 360-degree stretch cover followed by a TEMPUR comfort layer for optimal cushioning, a TEMPUR support layer for pressure relief, and a foam base layer for added durability.  The TEMPUR-Cloud is also available as a hybrid mattress with 1,000 individually wrapped coils between the support and base layer for added bounce and movement. Tempur-Pedic's other bedding collections, the TEMPUR-Adapt and the TEMPUR-Breeze are available with enhanced pressure-relieving and cooling properties, respectively, as well as varied firmness options, which are offered at a higher price point.  The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress features a breathable cooling cover made from heat-absorbent polyethylene fibers followed by CertiPUR-US certified gel-infused memory foam, a three-inch soft, response transition foam layer, a seven-inch ActiveSupport Stability Base layer, and lower cover to keep your mattress in place. It's slightly thicker at 12-inches.  Like Tempur-Pedic, Nectar offers each of its mattresses as a hybrid and has upgraded models, such as the Nectar Premier, which has an extra inch of foam and enhanced cooling features. Tempur-Pedic's TEMPUR-Cloud is more expensive in every size compared to the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress. At $1,999 for a queen, it's more than twice the price of Nectar mattresses, but it is also the most affordable Tempur-Pedic option. Tempur-Pedic will frequently discount the Cloud by 30%. The Nectar mattress is valued at $1,099, but it's typically marked down by as much as 40% off.  Winner: Nectar The only real way to know if you like a new mattress is to sleep on it. Tempur-Pedic has a 90-night trial period, so you can test it out and see if it's right for you. However, a return shipping fee will apply.  Tempur-Pedic offers a 10-year full replacement limited warranty which includes a replacement or repair for any damage covered under the warranty at no cost to you. When used with a proper, supportive foundation, it covers deterioration from normal wear. Some specific instances where you'd be covered by warranty include structural damage or broken components, squeaks and rattles, and sagging not caused by a poor bed frame.  Nectar has an industry-leading 365-night trial period and offers customers a ""forever warranty."" You'll receive a full refund if you choose to return your mattress during the trial period.  The ""Forever"" warranty does have loopholes, however. It's only valid for the original purchaser of the mattress, it's void if you remove the cover, and if the mattress is more than 10 years old, Nectar can repair (not replace) it and charge you for shipping both ways. Winner: Nectar Once your new mattress arrives at your doorstep, you'll want to get it set up and ready to use as soon as possible, as prolonged compression can damage the bed's ability to expand fully. The Nectar comes shrink-wrapped in a box, while the TEMPUR-Cloud arrives in a reusable canvas bag with two handles, making it easier to carry.  For both the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud, you need to cut through the plastic areas until you reach the mattress and then allow it to expand. For the TEMPUR-Cloud, the brand says you'll be able to go to sleep on it in minutes after opening. However, Nectar recommends letting the mattress fully expand between 24 and 72 hours before use. Both mattresses have that ""new bed"" smell, but during testing we noticed that dissipated after a few hours. In terms of assembly, Nectar offers ""Premium In-Home Setup"" for $199. With this service, the brand works with a local service provider to set up the mattress in your home and remove your old mattress. While Tempur-Pedic offers white-glove delivery for its Adapt and Breeze mattresses, the Cloud ships to your doorstep and no in-home setup is available. Both mattresses are pretty easy to set up on your own so it's not that big of a hindrance. Winner: Tempur-Pedic 
 Comfort is vital when it comes to a mattress, and while overall a subjective assessment, we consider factors like firmness, support, and sleep position to help evaluate. Both the Nectar memory foam mattress and the Tempur-Pedic Cloud are suitable for all sleepers (side, back, and stomach), hot sleepers, and those with back pain. Our sleep reporter found the Nectar most comfortable on his side, while finding a reasonable amount of comfort on his back and stomach. He liked sleeping on his side, back, and stomach, equally, on the Cloud.  In terms of feel, we noticed the Nectar contoured toward our individual body shape and provided a comfortable cradling effect. We sank into the foam, but not enough where it felt like there was no support. For the TEMPUR-Cloud, our tester said it was the most comfortable mattress they've ever slept on and contoured to their body regardless of position.   On the firmness scale, the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress falls at a 6.5 out of 10, firmness level, according to the brand, but our experience places it as a soft-medium. The TEMPUR-Cloud is described by the brand as being ""soft where you want it and firm where you need it."" We deemed it to be medium-firm, which is around a 6. It's also suitable for those with back pain. Winner: Tempur-Pedic If you're a hot sleeper, then you'll appreciate a mattress with optimal heat dissipation so you're not constantly overheating in bed. For the Nectar mattress, we used a laser thermometer to measure the surface temperature of the mattress right before lying down and after getting up. The Nectar increased by about 19 degrees when we laid on it, which is about average among mattresses we've tested. That said, it was highly effective in dissipating heat, and dropped by nearly 15 degrees when we got up.  When we tested the TEMPUR-Cloud, we didn't have the thermometer tests in place. However, we noticed that it sleeps cool and dissipates heat well. We had no heat-related critiques, ranking it as the best memory foam cooling mattress. If you're looking for a mattress with even more cooling features from Tempur-Pedic, the LuxeBreeze sleeps up to 10 degrees cooler and features ventilated foam. Winner: Tempur-Pedic Edge support is vital when sharing a mattress with a partner because it determines how much usable mattress space there actually is on the mattress, and it can make getting in and out of bed more supportive. To test the edge support of the mattresses, we rested on the edge of each mattress and used a yardstick to measure how much the mattress sank.  During testing we were disappointed in the edge support in the TEMPUR-Cloud and noticed significant sinking toward the edges.  On the contrary, with the Nectar mattress, we had to actually push ourselves to the side before falling off the bed. Plus, when we measured it with a ruler, it sank 3 inches, which is less than a majority of the other mattresses we've tested in the past. It's not the firmest edge support out there, but it was more supportive. Winner: Nectar Light sleepers and couples who are sensitive to movement will benefit greatly from a mattress with minimal motion transfer.  To evaluate motion transfer, we placed a can of soda in the center of the mattresses and dropped a bowling ball 4 feet above the beds, letting it land 12 inches from the can. With the TEMPUR-Cloud, the can stayed upright every time, which indicates that the mattress had minimal motion transfer. For the Nectar mattress, the can barely moved, and the vibrometer picked up fewer vibrations during the process. Winner: Tie If you're deciding between the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud and money is not an issue, the TEMPUR-Cloud is our preferred option. Although they both are easy to set up and comfortable to sleep on, the Tempur-Pedic Cloud has a more luxurious feel with its TEMPUR-material and outperformed in almost all evaluations, except edge support. Of course, Nectar's pricing and policies make the Nectar a great option for the budget-conscious and those who are comforted by the idea of a lengthy sleep trial and lifetime warranty, leaving little space for any buyer's remorse. Both are well-suited to hot sleepers and those with back pain. We find the Nectar a a comfortable option for side and back sleepers, while all sleep types can benefit from the TEMPUR-Cloud.  Read our full Nectar Memory Foam Mattress review and Tempur-Pedic Cloud mattress review.

All three benchmark indexes ticked higher, with the Dow surging by over 200 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching record highs. Inflation came in softer than expected, with consumer prices remaining flat over the month of May. On a yearly basis, inflation was up 3.3%. That's slightly lower than the 3.4% yearly increase recorded in April, marking the second month in a row that prices have cooled. Bond yields plunged after the report. The 10-year US Treasury dove 11 basis points to 4.287% ""Wednesday's weaker-than-expected CPI will allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates as soon as September since we have now seen multiple encouraging inflation readings, after the concerning spike in inflation earlier this year,"" Skyler Weinand, the chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said in a note. ""There's a clear path to a soft landing and the Fed may very well be coming to the market's rescue in as little as three months."" Investors are largely expecting the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday afternoon, but markets remain hopeful the central bank will loosen monetary policy by the end of the year. Fed fund futures show a 71% chance the Fed could cut rates three times or more by December, according to the CME FedWatch tool. ""Things are playing out as the Fed hoped, so Jerome Powell will probably be feeling good this afternoon,"" David Russell, the global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in a statement.

3,insider@insider.com (Rachel Chang),"I bought my last Starbucks drink 4 years ago. I pay more for coffee now, but the benefits are worth it.",https://www.businessinsider.com/stopped-going-to-starbucks-what-i-learned-benefits-downsides-2024-6,"I was addicted to Starbucks, so I stopped going there over four years ago. There have been drawbacks to quitting Starbucks, but many perks, too.",2024-06-12T19:25:40Z,"The offers and details on this page may have updated or changed since the time of publication. See our article on Business Insider for current information. When I first started drinking coffee, I was intimidated by every café that had its own long menu with unique drink names and too many ways to personalize a drink. Soon, I found comfort in Starbucks: No matter where in the world I was, I could order the exact same thing and know what to expect. As a travel journalist, I began searching for the familiar logo everywhere, from Bali and Morocco to Barcelona and Buenos Aires. It wasn't hard — Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world, on track to have 55,000 stores by 2030. But about four and a half years ago, I was on my way to claim my free Starbucks birthday drink when a lightbulb went off in my head.  I was in San Francisco, and as I passed one adorable little coffee shop after another, I wondered why I was overlooking so many small businesses so I could get coffee from a megacorporation that netted $36 billion in the 2023 fiscal year. That day, I sipped my last drop of frozen coffee through a green straw (OK, technically a sippy top since the chain had stopped offering plastic straws by then) and quit Starbucks. Though I live a block from a Starbucks, I started forcing myself to walk past it in search of local options. My self-imposed ban began in 2020 during the peak days of the coronavirus pandemic, so I quickly realized the spending power I had with my daily coffee. Many independent coffee shops closed during or shortly after the height of the pandemic. Even now, smaller cafés depend on every customer's support.  Starbucks doesn't need my money as much, even though it had actually been cheaper for me. At the time, I'd been spending $3 to $5 for my Starbucks drinks. At local shops, my drinks were closer to $4 to $7. After happily paying extra for milk substitutes and gratuity at small businesses, the cost of my typical coffee order eventually started inching closer to double digits. Still, I felt better knowing the dollars were going back to my community. Giving up Starbucks also meant I'd have to break some old habits.  Instead of rotely going to the closest Starbucks, I began to pull up Google Maps to search for a new coffee shop every time. In the beginning, I often landed at mediocre cafés. But as I started traveling again, I realized what felt like a chore at home started to feel like a delight when I was abroad. After all, traveling is all about discovering new finds. Every coffee shop has its own menu, system, and style. Instead of being an old pro in a familiar place, I became the constant newbie in a strange setting, asking for WiFi passwords and bathroom keys. Eventually, trying new spots became a mini daily adventure stirred up into my coffee break.  The bottom line is that my coffee budget has gone up — I recently paid $12.69 for a vanilla oat latte at a local shop, about $5 more than it would've cost at Starbucks — but now I see more than a cup of joe. I see coffee time as an experience, a moment to connect with a slice of a community that I wouldn't normally have been immersed in.  Plus, at local coffee shops, I'm one of few customers instead of one of many in a long line. I'm more likely to get doted on with top-notch service instead of just feeling like a name on a cup. Sometimes, I still end up at coffee chains — but my self-imposed ban means I'll opt for smaller ones like Blank Street or Gregory's Coffee instead of mega-global franchises. I still feel like a bit of a jerk when I have business meetings scheduled at a Starbucks and ask to go somewhere else. But it's a pretty good conversation starter, and I've even had colleagues tell me they're also steering away from the chain. I don't have a personal vendetta against Starbucks. It's just that by quitting, my coffee world has opened up beyond the limitations of one company — and forever hunting for a new coffee shop has become my ultimate pick-me-up.

4,jsor@businessinsider.com (Jennifer Sor),"Mega-cap stocks are overvalued and risk a big correction, according to a CIO. Here's why that presents a 'monstrous' buying opportunity.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-dot-com-bubble-crash-buy-opportunity-2024-6,"The bubble in the market's most-hyped stocks could burst, but that means the rest of the market stands to gain, Richard Bernstein said.",2024-06-11T17:34:44Z,"The most expensive stocks are poised for a steep correction,  but that could present a ""monster"" buying opportunity in nearly every other area of the market, according to Wall Street veteran Richard Bernstein. The RBA chief investment officer pointed to a discrepancy between the debt and equity markets, which could hint at a soon-to-come market correction. In the debt market, credit spreads are narrowing, which is what typically happens when corporate profits are growing. But, only a narrow group of stocks are dominating the equity market, which implies profits aren't expanding for most companies. There are a number of things that could explain that disconnect. The bond market could be flashing a false signal, which would imply that there could be a credit event and a wave of corporate bankruptcies on the horizon, Bernstein said. However, the more likely explanation is that the most expensive stocks on the market are way overvalued and are headed for a correction, while the bond market signals rising strength for the rest of the companies that make up the S&P 500.  ""Fundamentally, it makes zero sense. The bond market is saying corporate profits are going to be strong … but the equity market with this incredibly narrow leadership of seven companies is saying that it's an apocalyptic earnings outlook,"" he told Business Insider in an interview. ""I think the stock market's in a bubble and the bond market is right."" Stocks have flashed other warning signs that investors are too caught up in speculative fervor for a handful of name. The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the benchmark's total value, the highest percentage ever recorded, according to analysis from Apollo. And when looking at the market cap of the largest stock on the market compared to the 75th percentile of stocks, the market looks to be the most overvalued since 1932, according to Goldman Sachs economists. Bernstein didn't have a prediction for when the bubble might burst, but it could inflict serious ""damage"" on the economy, with equity losses that rival the dot-com crash, he warned. After the boom in internet stocks, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78% from its peak, and tech stocks continued to struggle over the next 14 years. That paved the way for a ""lost decade"" in the stock market, with the S&P 500 losing 1% from 1999 to 2009. ""That's what I think we're looking at,"" Bernstein warned. ""It's multiple years of significant underperformance."" But for investors who have diversified away from the most expensive mega-cap tech stocks, the bubble popping would be good news for their portfolios.  While large-cap stocks tanked during the lost decade of the 2000s, small-cap, energy, and emerging market stocks did exceedingly well. The Russell 2000 gained 48% from 1999 to 2009 and the MSCI Emerging Markets IMI Index soared 145% in that time.  Bernstein says his firm is bullish on everything except the top stocks in the market today, which have soared amid Wall Street's hype for AI. In a previous note, he said the stock market's shifting leadership from the most-hyped names to underloved equities presents once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors. ""We like everything except for seven stocks. I actually think the opportunity set is probably the broadest it's ever been in my entire career,"" he said. ""I think the opportunity is monstrous here.""

5,insider@insider.com (Shannon Ullman),The 8 best linen sheet sets for effortless lived-in comfort,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/home/best-linen-sheets,"We love linen for its natural temperature-regulating properties and durability. The best linen sheets include soft, cooling, and all-season options.",2024-06-11T21:19:37Z,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more  The right bedding can be the difference between a restorative, restful evening and a night of tossing and turning. While cotton, silk, and microfiber sheets have long been popular choices for the best sheets, linen has a loyal following due to its breathability, durability, and timeless look. Linen sheets are made from all-natural fibers that come from the flax plant. These fibers are typically thicker, longer, and more intricately woven than other fabrics, like cotton. As a highly sought-after (and expensive) fabric, the best linen sheets are the ones that truly live up to their reputation. I slept on 10 different brands of linen sheets over the course of a month to evaluate their fit, feel, and overall quality. I spoke with several sleep and textile experts on the benefits of linen and how to find a set that will last. After much deliberation, my top pick is the Brooklinen Washed Linen Core Sheet Set because it has a soft, luxe bedding feel without being overly heavy or stifling. Another beloved option on our team is the Sijo LuxeWeave Linen Sheet set, made of organic, small-batch linen that sleeps cool and gets softer with each wash. Keep reading to find out which sheets are worth investing in for a better night's sleep. Best overall: Brooklinen Washed Linen Core Sheet - See at Brooklinen Best budget: Quince Linen Sheet Set - See at Quince Best organic: Sijo LuxWeave Linen Sheet Set - See at Sijo Best cooling: Parachute Linen Sheet Set - See at Parachute Most heavyweight: Coyuchi Organic Relaxed Linen Sheets - See at Coyuchi Best cooling: Parachute Linen Sheet Set - See at Parachute Softest: West Elm European Flax Linen Sheet Set - See at West Elm Best all-season: The Citizenry Stonewashed Linen Sheet Set - See at The Citizenry Best color selection: MagicLinen Sheet Set - See at MagicLinen 
                                      Linen is known to be rough and itchy, but these linen sheets are remarkably soft, airy, cooling, and durable.
                                     Specifics While all of the linen sets I tried claimed to be soft, some still had an underlying roughness or stiffness to them. Not the case here — this Brooklinen set felt like sleeping on a cloud straight out of the bag. There was no itchiness; the sheets only got softer with each wash. The weight is also perfect for hot sleepers. Typically, linen sheets indicate a heavier material that leaves some people feeling trapped and overheated. But this linen set is thin and light enough to maintain a cool temperature throughout the night. Some lightweight sheets can feel flimsy, but these had a high-quality feel that held up nicely without any rips or tears. The packaging was also a nice touch, coming in a cloth bag for storage. In terms of durability, I did notice some slight pilling after washing, but nothing that affected the overall feel or comfort of the sheets. Anyone who cares about the aesthetic of their bedding will love that there are five colors to choose from, as well as some limited edition palettes. The set comes with the standard essentials: a flat sheet, a fitted sheet, and two pillowcases, but Brooklinen also sells individual pieces and sets without a flat sheet if that's your preference. Most Brooklinen items can be returned within a year, but you are subjected to a $9.95 return fee. Read our Brooklinen Washed Linen Sheets review for more information. 
                                      Made from 100% European flax, this soft and durable set comes in under $200.
                                     Specifics When it comes to color options, Quince's linen sheets reign supreme, with over 20 different shades to snuggle under. From a deep Bordeaux to the ultra-airy sage or a timeless terracotta and white stripe, there's a color for every taste and bedroom aesthetic. But these sheets aren't just about looks — they also deliver on comfort and durability. Made from 100% European flax, these sheets have a soft feel that falls directly in between Brooklinen's Washed Linen Core Sheets and Sijo's LuxeWeave Linen Sheets. The material was quite luxurious and inviting, albeit a bit warm. So, if you sleep on the hotter side, you might want to give these thicker sheets a pass.  Quince also passed the test for two major sheet sticking points: pilling and bed-making. The fitted sheet comes with those handy top and bottom tags, and both layers went through the wash without pilling. For those who like a monochromatic look, Quince also has duvet covers in the same color options as the sheets. Additionally, Quince has a 365-day return policy (yes, you read that right), so if these linen sheets aren't your cup of tea after trying them out, you can return them within a year for a full refund. 
                                      The cool, airy, and beautiful linen sheets from Sijo will be your summer favorite, or if you regularly sleep hot, a durable yearlong standby.
                                     Specifics These Sijo sheets feel like what you'd imagine most linen sheets to be: rough, stiff, and slightly itchy. While this set may not be the softest on the market, it certainly makes up for it in the durability department, and they get softer with each wash.  Others across the Insider Reviews team who've slept on the sheets for years described the Sijo sheets as ""the right balance of comfort, coolness, durability, and price."" They were previously our top pick for the best linen sheets — only to be edged out by Brooklinen for their out-of-the-packaging softness — and rank in our guide to the best sheets as our top pick for cooling sheets.   Despite the initial fuzzies and loose, white strings I found when making the bed, the sheets held up well after washing without any pilling or loose threads. Putting on the fitted sheet was easy, and it stayed in place throughout the night, but I did find myself wishing for top and bottom tags as a reference point, like with our overall pick from Brooklinen. Where this set really shines is in its vibrant color options. I opted for the forest green, but there are eight total shades to choose from, and the set comes with the standard essentials. Linen is known for its temperature-regulating properties, and I found these sheets to be neither too hot nor too cold. So if you're a neutral sleeper looking for a more durable linen option, the LuxWeave Linen by Sijo is worth considering. 
                                      Parachute's linen sheets are woven tightly enough that they almost feel silky to the touch, and they remain breathable while still keeping you warm at night.
                                    
                                   Specifics For those who prefer to mix and match their bedding pieces, Parachute's linen sheet set is the perfect option. Sold separately in flat sheets, fitted sheets, and pillowcases, you can create a personalized set with only the pieces you need. They even offer multiple pillowcase styles. Beyond the customization perks, these sheets were practically made for hot sleepers. The ultra-thin material is incredibly cooling and breathable, with a lightweight feel that only gets softer with each wash. Plus, the sheets themselves are easy to put on the bed, which can be a struggle with thicker or stiffer materials. Made from 100% European flax and certified by Oeko-Tex Standard 100, these sheets are high quality and adhere to safe textile production practices. However, the thin material may not be as durable as some of the other options on this list, so keep that in mind if you tend to put your bedding through the wringer. Unfortunately, Parachute does not offer a storage bag with their linen sheet set. But they do offer eight color options and free returns within 60 days — plenty of time to decide if these sheets are the key to your best night's sleep. Read our Parachute Linen Sheets review for more information. 
                                      With a heavy yet breathable feel, these organic luxury sheets are designed to last longer than most
                                     Specifics Linen sheets tend to have that lightweight feel, which is why they're a popular option among hot sleepers. But if you like your bedding to have a bit more heft (especially during those cold winter nights), Coyuchi's organic linen set may be right up your alley. The sheets — which come in seven neutral colors — feel heavy and substantial but still breathable enough to prevent waking up in a pool of sweat. While the Sijo and Coyuchi sets are both organic and durable, the Coyuchi definitely feels more heavy-duty. If you're looking for a linen sheet to get you through the chilly winter nights, Coyuchi may be your best bet.  Immediately out of the package, these linen sheets felt like linen sheets: stiff and a little rough. But the fabric definitely felt durable, and overall, the set was easy to throw on the bed. I did notice a few pilling spots and loose threads on the fitted sheet, as well as a lack of top and bottom tags, which isn't ideal for a higher-priced set. Although Coyuchi lists no certifications, the sheets are made from 100% organic French flax, and the brand prides itself on its sustainable practices. Overall, if you're looking for a luxurious and organic linen option that will last longer than most, Coyuchi's Relaxed Linen Sheets are worth considering. Just be prepared to spend a bit more on quality and sustainability. 
                                      The softness of these sheets is enough to convert any jersey-knit stan into a linen believer.
                                     Specifics West Elm's European Flax Linen Sheet Set is a game changer for those who prioritize softness above all else. You'll find none of that classic linen roughness here. Made from 100% European flax and certified by Oeko-Tex Standard 100, these sheets have a noticeable softness right out of the package that only gets cozier with each wash. But unlike cotton-esque softness that can feel stifling and hot, the linen material is incredibly breathable and cooling. It's like sleeping on a cloud but without the sweat. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well these sheets held up in the wash — no pilling or shrinking issues to be found. While the immediate softness is a major plus, some factors make me question how durable these sheets will be in the long run. Putting on the fitted sheet was easy, but the elastic felt a bit flimsy and loose. There were also some loose threads on the pillowcase, another indicator that these sheets may not be able to withstand heavy usage. If you're willing to overlook those concerns for the sake of ultimate softness, then these linen sheets are a great option. They come in 22 different color options (note: some hues are made-to-order and take longer to receive) and have a 30-day return policy if they don't live up to your expectations. 
                                      With a weight that falls right in the middle of airy and heavy-duty, these durable sheets will keep you cozy all year long.
                                     Specifics For those looking for a linen sheet set that can handle the thick humidity of July and the blustery storms of December, look no further than The Citizenry. The brand's Stonewashed Linen Sheet Set weighs 160 gsm, making it the perfect middle ground between lightweight and heavy-duty. Also, right in the middle? It's texture. I wouldn't put it in the category of ultra-rough linen as it has some softness to it, but it's definitely not like curling up in a pile of marshmallows. However, the material feels durable and high-quality, giving you confidence that these sheets will hold up well over time. In terms of practicality, these sheets are a dream. They're easy to put on your bed without any major wrinkling or shrinking post-wash. And speaking of washing, they come out looking and feeling great with each cycle. One downside to these sheets is that they do sleep slightly warm. It's not unbearable (especially when the temperatures drop), but it could be an issue for those who run extra-hot at night.  More good news? You've got 14 colors and three patterns to choose from and 30 days to decide if these sheets are the all-season option for you. 
                                      The cool, airy, and beautiful linen sheets from MagicLinen will be your summer favorite, or if you regularly sleep hot, a durable yearlong standby.
                                     Specifics Linen is the only thing you can buy from MagicLinen, which is precisely the reason it's been able to edge out other brands that have only treated the material as one more piece of their larger bedding puzzles. All of its products are handcrafted in Vilnius, Lithuania. The linen is stonewashed — a softening process that's completely natural and non-toxic — and OEKO-Tex certified, meaning it meets chemical safety standards and is free from harmful substances. 
                          
                          These sheets particularly stood out to executive editor Sally Kaplan because they come in deep options for mattresses up to 18 inches thick, a sizing that's usually difficult to find for linen. The standard size fits mattresses up to 10 inches thick.  According to Sally, MagicLinen's sheets aren't the softest out of the bag, but after two years of use, they've aged well, getting softer and cozier with every wash. MagicLinen offers a 30-day trial, but return shipping is the responsibility of the customer. If you're not sure yet about committing, you can get fabric samples. A set of all the colors only costs $5, plus you'll get a $5 discount off your next purchase.  Read our full MagicLinen linen sheet set review for more information. Not all linen sheets are created equal. So we consulted with Frej Lewenhaupt, textile expert, co-founder, and CEO of Steamery, on the telltale signs that a set of linen sheets is worth investing in. Fiber Content: Lewenhaupt says a good rule of thumb is that the fewer synthetic fibers on a label, the better. If a brand lists out more than four fibers in its blend or doesn't advertise specific percentages, that's a red flag. Aim for linen sheets made with 100% flax. Flax Origin: Linen is constructed out of the flax plant — and where that plant is grown can make a huge difference in the quality of the final product. Flax linen is typically soft, durable, temperature-regulating, and absorbent.  Weight:  Linen's weight is measured in grams per square meter (GSM.) A high GSM will typically result in a denser fabric, while a lower GSM might feel more lightweight. Linen tends to be either lightweight or medium-weight. For example, a lightweight linen may be about 130 GSM, while a medium-weight linen could be 150 to 350 GSM. The higher the GSM, the warmer the linen sheet might feel while sleeping.  Certifications: Look for certifications like Oeko-Tex Standard 100, which confirms that a product is free of harmful chemicals. To determine which linen sheets are really worth your while, I tested 10 of the most highly-rated sets and slept on them for multiple nights to measure their feel, weight, durability, and overall comfort. Each set was tested for three nights in a row and washed and dried once. I also consulted with experts, like Frej Lewenhaupt, a textile expert, cofounder, and CEO of Steamery, and Martin Bide, a professor in the department of textiles at the University of Rhode Island, for insights on which factors I should pay special attention to. These are the factors I took into consideration when testing each set: Immediate softness: Linen gets a bad rap for being rough and scratchy, but that's not always the case. I noted how soft each set felt upon first touch and snooze. Weight: I considered the weight (GSM) of each set. The higher the GSM, the heavier and thicker the material. I kept the weight of each set in mind and whether it resulted in a hotter or cooler sleep experience. Post-wash feel: Some sheets come out of the dryer looking and feeling like they've been through a war. Others, not so much. After washing and drying each set, I looked for any signs of pilling, shedding, shrinking, or wrinkling. Ease of use:  We've all wrestled with a fitted sheet at some point. I noted how easy (or difficult) it was to get each set onto the bed without any significant wrinkles, creases, or bunching. Durability: Linen's durability is a big selling point for many, as the textile can last years if properly cared for. I looked for signs of wear and tear and how durable the material felt. Linen is an all-natural fiber from the flax plant. Its long and strong fibers make it a more durable fabric that is also highly absorbent, naturally moisture-wicking, and dries quickly compared to other options like cotton.    Linen is expensive because it can only be grown in certain locations, and the production process is labor-intensive. Flax plants prefer cooler climates and are typically grown in  European locations like Belgium. The growing and processing of flax plants into linen is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which drives up the price.  Linen sheets aren't exactly high maintenance, but there are a few tips for keeping your linen sheets well-cared for. When washing linen sheets, avoid hot water that could break down the fibers. Instead, opt for warm water and a delicate wash setting. Try to avoid harsh chemicals in laundry detergents that could break down linen fibers and cause discoloration. Consider air-drying linen sheets to preserve durability, but using a dryer on a low heat, tumble setting should work just fine.  Other than enjoying the aesthetic, Bide recommends linen sheets for hot sleepers or anyone who enjoys a cooler sleep since linen is absorbent and has a ""cool"" feel.  Lewenhaupt says linen is typically more durable than cotton as the fibers have a longer and more open structure. This structure makes linen more absorbent, which is what gives them that cooling sensation.  According to Bide, yes. He says that linen is known to be absorbent, hence its use for dish towels and old-fashioned handkerchiefs. You're unlikely to get that ""clammy"" feeling from a linen sheet, making it a great option for hot sleepers. There is no ""best"" when it comes to sheets, as what you sleep on is largely a matter of personal preference. However, linen sheets tend to be durable and long-lasting. Linen made from Flax grown in France or Belgium is the highest quality, according to Lewenhaupt. Some hotels use linen sheets, but most use high-quality cotton sheets in their bedding. There is no scientific evidence that linen sheets help you sleep better, as the material you sleep best on is a matter of preference. But if you tend to sleep hot, the breathability of linen may be beneficial.

                                 According to Lorena M. Valdes, a colorist at Chicago's Maxine Salon, the Kérastase Chronologiste Shampoo for Dull and Brittle Hair ""brings volume and bounce back to brittle and dull hair."" As such, explains the pro, this shampoo is an optimal pick for color-treated tresses. Meanwhile, ingredient highlights include hydrating hyaluronic acid and nourishing vitamin E. Combat damaged hair with Paul Mitchell's Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo, which Taylor describes as ideal for dry, damaged, and color-treated tresses. ""It really rebuilds your hair,"" Taylor says. Its sulfate- and paraben-free formula—which is spiked glycerin plus smoothing keratin, vitamin-loaded ginger root, and antioxidant-laden green tea—even boasts a pleasant ginger tea scent. Every expert we spoke to agreed that the best shampoo for blondes are purple shampoos, which boast brassiness-banishing formulas. Devin Toth, a stylist at Salon SCK in New York City, loves Shu Uemura's Yūbi Blonde Anti-Brass Purple Shampoo for its ""cool violet pigments that completely neutralize brassy tones in the hair."" He continues, telling Insider, ""It also contains Japanese white peony, which soothes, softens, and moisturizes hair.""

It also contains moisturizing Babassu oil, which Saviano credits with keeping ""dry and curly hair types hydrated, smooth and frizz-free."" Plus, it's under $15.  Valdes tells INSIDER that the Fable & Main HoliRoots Hydrating Shampoo is excellent for keratin support, making it a solid choice for folks with straight hair. Its gentle yet effective formula includes coconut and aloe to smooth and add shine to the hair and targets dry and flaky scalps that need extra hydration. Fine hair, do care. That's why Saviano recommends the Vegamour ENSO 01 Shampoo for its ultra-lightweight formula, which is ""free from toxic ingredients, phthalates, and silicones that cause hair to be limp and flat."" As a bonus, this color-safe shampoo is enriched with hydration-boosting glycerin and vitamin-rich aloe. Ouai's Thick Hair Shampoo is Taylor's top pick for clients with a head full of hair. He tells Insider, ""I've noticed it easily cleans every strand of hair in one shampoo and is super hydrating."" Additionally, it's enriched with beneficial ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, and avocado oil. If you have oily strands, consider incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your hair-care routine. Taylor recommends Oribe's The Cleanse Clarifying Shampoo, which should be used no more than once a week. Per the stylist, this shampoo ""uses skincare exfoliants and does away with dirt, oil, and product buildup without completely stripping your hair like most clarifying shampoos."" According to Taylor, the best way to describe the blue-hued Redken's Color Extend Brownlightes Shampoo is as a purple shampoo but for brunettes. ""This sulfate-free shampoo tones and neutralizes brass in both natural and color-treated brunettes,"" Taylor says. The Oribe Shampoo for Beautiful Color is especially ideal for those with red hair thanks to its color-locking formula. ""I love that it provides a gentle cleanse without using sulfates,"" explains Valdes. Not only is this shampoo great for keratin-treated strands, but it's also loaded with glycerin—-along with antioxidant-loaded rosemary leaf extract and fatty acid-rich sunflower extract.

7,lsavoie@insider.com (Lauren Savoie),KitchenAid Classic Plus Stand Mixer review: An entry-level mixer that's perfect for occasional bakers,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/kitchen/kitchenaid-stand-mixer-classic-plus-review,"If you're a casual baker, the KitchenAid Classic Plus is one of the best stand mixers you can buy. Here's why it's an enduring team favorite.",2024-06-14T15:41:44Z,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more  Some of my favorite childhood memories involve one of the best KitchenAid stand mixers. When I moved into my first apartment, it was a right of passage to receive a KitchenAid mixer of my own: an older version of the KitchenAid Classic Plus 4.5 Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer handed down from my dad that lasted me for years. (If your family is loyal to another kitchen appliance brand, check out our picks for the best stand mixer to make your own baking memories.) Over the years, I encountered the KitchenAid Classic Plus again and again: in homes of my family members, as a cook in professional kitchens, and most recently as a product tester writing our guide to the best KitchenAid stand mixers. Through years and years of experience, I can confidently say it's one of the best gadgets you can buy for the money. 
                                      The least expensive model made by KitchenAid, the Classic Plus has all the quality components of more expensive mixers but it's compact, efficient, and powerful enough to accomplish most tasks for casual bakers.
                                     Specifics Wattage conveys the power of the motor: the gist is that lower-wattage models have less powerful motors than higher-wattage models. KitchenAid stand mixers range from 250 to 970 watts, and the Classic Plus is on the lower end of that spectrum with a 275-watt motor. This is perfectly adequate for common tasks like making cookies, brownies, whipped cream, cake, and the occasional bread loaf.  However, if you're someone who bakes every week or regularly makes really tough, stiff doughs, you'll want to choose a model with 400 watts or above. For our guide to the best KitchenAid stand mixers, I tested a new version of the KitchenAid Classic Plus and used it to mix cookie dough, whip egg whites, and knead hefty bagel dough. The mixer comes with three attachments for accomplishing each of these tasks: a paddle mixer, a whisk, and a dough hook.  The stand mixer is super easy to operate and use. There are just two levers: one to lock the mixer head in place for safer operation, and one to adjust the speed. The lowest speed gently mixes in delicate ingredients (like chocolate chips for cookie dough) and the highest speed tackles tough tasks like kneading bread dough. For most uses, you won't need to go past speed 7 or so.  Performance-wise, it excelled at mixing cookie dough and whipping egg whites, but struggled a bit through the bagel dough. While the dough ultimately came together fine, I wouldn't trust it with double batches and I'd probably limit these tough tasks to just a couple times a year for the longevity of the mixer. At 25 pounds, it's a hefty mixer. And while it's lighter than most other KitchenAid models, it's still a task to move it around. The mixer itself is made of enamel-coated metal, which is super durable and heavy. You can wipe the body down easily after use with a damp cloth. The mixing bowl is fairly light made of smooth metal that is very easy to clean. I usually just throw it in the dishwasher.  Determine whether the wattage suits your needs. This isn't something you want to find out by experimenting; burning out the motor is a repairable issue, but one that will cost you (sometimes almost as much as a new stand mixer). I really would caution anyone who thinks they'll be using their stand mixer weekly or for lots of bread to choose a more powerful model from our guide to the best KitchenAids or the best stand mixers.  Another thing that peeves me about stand mixer advertising is that the actual usable capacity is much smaller than the state capacity. The KitchenAid Classic Plus claims a 4.5-quart capacity, but the functional capacity is actually closer to 3 quarts. It'll accommodate single batches of most recipes, but don't expect to be doubling up on recipes in this mixer. Best value: Cuisinart 5.5-Quart Tilt Head Stand Mixer – See at AmazonFor an impressive stand mixer at a lower price point, the Cuisinart Tilt Head has a powerful motor for mixing and kneading tough doughs, but is surprisingly light and compact. For the occasional or beginner baker, this is a great model to get started with. It's made with the same metal parts as more expensive KitchenAid stand mixers, has a strong motor, and a relatively roomy work bowl. If a stand mixer seems out of reach for you, one of our best hand mixers might be a better choice. It'll take up less real estate on your counter and is great if you aren't ready to invest in a KitchenAid.

8,Shubhangi Goel,I was laid off one day before my 2nd child was born. I landed a job at Meta in a month thanks to 5 habits I practiced even before the layoff.,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-find-job-after-tech-layoff-meta-cruise-engineer-2024-6,Engineer Vishwanath Eswarakrishnan was let go from Cruise a day before his second child was born. He found a job at Meta in a month.,2024-06-07T00:37:50Z,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vishwanath Eswarakrishnan, a software engineer who joined Meta's Menlo Park, California office in March 2024. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history. I have been laid off twice, both during crucial times in my personal life. Two years into my software engineering career, I was impacted by a reduction in force at a data infrastructure company. I was laid off on March 1 and had 30 days to find another job that would sponsor a work visa. I managed to get an offer from Oracle, and the company suggested I work from another country until they could sponsor my H-1B in a year. But it wasn't an option for me — I was about to get engaged to my now-wife and needed something secure. I got another offer from a data storage startup days before my stay in the US expired. I worked there for close to five years and moved to eBay in 2020 and then to Cruise in 2022. My second layoff came in December last year after a Cruise robotaxi was involved in a pedestrian accident in San Francisco. (The company laid off 24% of its workforce.) I was up for a promotion, and the team was preparing my new package. But I was let go from Cruise, and I got the news one day before my wife had our second child. There were complications, and my job was the last thing on my mind. Once things started settling, I updated my LinkedIn to reflect ""Open to work"" and started receiving messages from recruiters. Here are three things I did before my layoff and two steps I took after that helped me land a software engineer role at Meta within a month. I never intended to be polite to the recruiters who reached out to me while I was employed just so they could help with jobs down the line. But, I always responded to their reach outs on LinkedIn and replied that I'm not looking for a role right now, and asked them to keep in touch. Being responsive and staying connected may have helped the fact that recruiters for AirBnB, Meta, Uber, and Snowflake reached out with opportunities right after my layoff and limited the companies that I had to apply to myself. Throughout my career, I made it a priority to ask questions and not do my job like a mechanical task. Asking why things work, and why things are done the way they are made me a better engineer, and made it much easier for me to answer both technical and leadership questions at interviews even though my schedule was packed to the brim. I was also able to reach out to an ex-manager from my time at eBay who moved to Meta and ask him to refer me, because he remembered me and was happy to vouch for my work. Even after my first layoff, I never tested the market every few years to gauge my worth. Switching companies was always a last resort, and I only moved when I felt like I had exhausted my learning or when I no longer saw a work-life balance fit. I asked for internal transfers and joined growing companies where I could hone various domains. I moved from security to core infrastructure and then to infrastructure for running simulations, which made me a good fit for many different openings and increased the chances of recruiters approaching me. One mindset that helped me stay calm during the process was focusing on what I could control, which was preparation for the interviews. Thinking about the thousands of other tech workers who have been let go would only have been demoralizing. Whenever thoughts of the layoff crossed my mind, I stopped thinking about it and focused on practicing my coding and system-design interviews. Having a calendar where I noted all my interviews, along with the names of the recruiters, was a lifesaver during that time period. Jotting down all my appointments helped me plan each day, especially since I gave a few interviews at the hospital during doctor visits for my newborn. Writing down the names of the people I was interviewing with gave me context and jogged my memory about what had been discussed with the company or the hiring manager before.

9,Jenny McGrath,"Scientists studied 8,000 cats to determine which breeds live the longest, and it could help you become a better pet owner",https://www.businessinsider.com/cat-breeds-live-longest-burmese-birman-2024-6,"Researchers studied different cat breeds to find which live the longest. Burmese and Birmans live about 14 years, two years longer than the average.",2024-06-08T11:09:02Z,"Burmese cats are active, outgoing, and excessively fond of grooming, according to some research. They may also be one of the cat breeds that live the longest. Most cat breeds are less than 150 years old, and there isn't a lot of information on how differences between the various types affect their lifespans. To help change that, a recent study compared 12 common cat breeds to determine which ones live the longest. Learning more about the different breeds will allow cat owners ""to predict the future life expectancy for their cats based on novel scientific methods and the power of big data,"" said study co-author and veterinarian Dan O'Neill in a statement. The researchers found Burmese and Birmans live the longest, with an average of 14 years, about two years longer than the average cat. But why these breeds outlive their peers isn't clear. For this recent study, researchers from London's Royal Veterinary College (RVC) and the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan looked at the ages of 7,936 cats who died between 2019 and 2021. Over 7,000 of the cats in the study were mixed breeds. Most of the other 11 breeds included breeds like British cats, Maine Coons, Ragdolls, and Persians. Typically, cats' life expectancies ranged from about 9 to 14 years, the researchers found. For example, siamese and mixed-breed cats' life expectancies were over 11.5 years, whereas others — Norwegian Forest, Maine Coon, Russian, and British — were over 9.5 years.  Here's a table of what the researchers found: Breed Life expectancy (years) Burmese 14.42 Birman 14.39 Crossbred 11.89 Siamese 11.69 Persian 10.93 Ragdoll 10.31 Norwegian Forest Cat 9.95 Maine Coon 9.71 Russian cats 9.65 British cats 9.58 Bengal 8.51 *Sphynx 6.68 *Some breeds, like Sphynx cats, may not have had enough data to accurately reflect lifespans, said Leslie Lyons, who studies domestic cat genetics at the University of Missouri. While the researchers' findings did indicate Burmese and Birmans lived longest, almost every breed had at least one cat that lived to be over 20 years old. One potential issue with some of the data is that it can be tricky for people to know their cats' breeds, Lyons said. ""Some of these cats listed as a particular breed might not really be what we would call a pedigreed breed,"" she said. An owner may assume their shelter cat with silvery fur is a Russian Blue, for example, when it's actually a mixed breed. Unlike dogs — some of which have been used for hundreds of years to hunt, corral sheep, or pull sleds — cats were often bred for aesthetic reasons rather than personality or athleticism. That's why breed differences aren't as dramatic in cats as they are in dogs and might not impact cats' health in the same way. It's not like comparing a Doberman to a Pekingese. That's because cats' aesthetic traits are genetically less complex than dogs' behavioral and functional ones, Lyons said. However, these breed preferences can still have unintended consequences, like Persian cats' short noses, which can cause breathing difficulties. In addition to breed, the study looked at a number of factors, like sex, weight, and whether the cat was spayed or neutered. Females and fixed cats both tended to live a bit longer. Lyons sees this study as a jumping-off point for further investigations into factors that impact life expectancies like time spent indoors or outdoors, which the study didn't account for.  Car accidents, parasites, and fights with other felines are just a few of the dangers for cats who venture outside. As a result, some research suggests outdoor cats have an average lifespan of only two to five years. The authors, who published their study in the peer-reviewed ""Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery,"" said further research is needed into the causes of death in companion cats, including in the Sphynx breed.

10,Erin McDowell,"I tried the cheapest cheeseburgers at McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King and the least expensive was my favorite",https://www.businessinsider.com/review-cheapest-cheeseburgers-fast-food-mcdonalds-wendys-burger-king-2024-6,Burger King's classic cheeseburger had the most flavorful burger and bun.,2024-06-08T13:17:01Z,"The price of the fast-food burger has risen over the years. Average fast-food menu prices have risen between 39% and 100% since 2014, and McDonald's prices have doubled in those 10 years, according to a May report by FinanceBuzz. Rising fast food prices are due to factors including inflation and increased labor costs, but the classic cheeseburger remains one of the cheapest menu items at most fast-food chains. I decided to order the cheapest cheeseburgers at the three biggest burger chains — McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's — to determine which one is worth your money. They all came with the same classic ingredients: a single beef patty, one slice of cheese, and ketchup. However, there was a clear winner in terms of taste and value. Here are the cheapest cheeseburgers at McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King, ranked from worst to best. The cheeseburger from McDonald's cost $3.49, excluding tax. I rarely get a regular cheeseburger from McDonald's; I usually prefer the larger, more elaborate burgers like the Quarter Pounder Deluxe with cheese or the chicken sandwiches.  I thought the bun was a touch limp and the cheese could have been more melted. However, the condiments overpowered the taste of the burger patty — this cheeseburger really only tasted of cheese and ketchup to me. I didn't really taste the onions, though I thought the pickles were tart and crunchy. The junior cheeseburger from Wendy's cost $3.74, excluding tax. It came topped with one slice of American cheese, pickles, onion, ketchup, and mustard on a toasted bun. The cheese was more melted on this burger than on the one from McDonald's. All of the ingredients, from the burger patty to the cheese and the thick slice of onion, really amplified the flavor of this palm-sized burger. The bun held up well, and I thought all the ingredients made this burger worth $3.74, which was the highest price of the three burgers. However, it still wasn't my favorite, or the most flavorful, cheeseburger. The cheeseburger from Burger King cost $2.59, excluding tax. This burger appeared to have a more generous serving of toppings compared to the other two cheeseburgers I tried.  I was anxious to see if this would lessen the burger's overall flavor, but it didn't.  The sesame-seed bun also added a lot of flavor — something I didn't get from the classic toasted buns at the other two chains. However, the standout star of this burger was the patty itself. The flame-grilled burger had a strong, smoky flavor that didn't overpower the other ingredients and was complemented perfectly by the ketchup and mustard. Not only was this burger the most flavorful, but it was also the best value — at $2.59, it was the cheapest burger I tried.

11,Michael Peck,The US military's confidence in smart bombs may have a fatal flaw,https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-confidence-smart-bombs-may-have-a-fatal-flaw-2024-6,"Precision warfare appeals to America's strengths, but a retired US Army officer argues that its effectiveness is a myth.",2024-06-08T09:00:01Z,"America loves smart bombs. Ever since World War II, precision warfare has appealed to what America sees as its strengths: High technology, efficiency and the ability to strike down its enemies with a minimum of harm to innocents. But that's actually a myth argues Amos Fox, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel. Precision-guided munitions, or PGMs, are no more effective than conventional munitions in limiting collateral damage, and in some cases can make the damage worse. Fox calls this the ""precision paradox."" Or, ""the incongruence between precision strike theory and the fervent enthusiasm of precision ideologues,"" he wrote in an essay for the Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank. Precision warfare is associated today with guided missiles, but the concept dates back to the 1930s, when the US began to embrace high-altitude daylight bombing by heavy bombers such as the B-17 Flying Fortress. Swayed by Italian airpower theorist Giulio Douhet, American planners were convinced they could cripple an adversary by bombing its factories, without the need for a costly ground war. This contrasted with Britain's night area-bombing strategy in World War II that targeted entire German cities. Even if factories weren't hit, residential neighborhoods would be destroyed and workers ""de-housed,"" which was expected to collapse the public's morale. In practice, the distinction between precision and area bombardment proved blurry: bombing through cloudy European skies that obscured targets, while under fighter and flak attack and relying on pencil-on-paper navigation plotting and rudimentary bomb sights meant the majority of American bombs failed to hit their target. PGMs were supposed to solve this problem. Why drop a dozen bombs when a single GPS-guided missile can destroy a bridge or a command post? Fox sees several flaws in modern precision strike theory. For one, ""decapitation"" strikes intended to defeat an enemy by eliminating its leaders and command posts have not worked. Nor does Fox believe that the precision strike strategy has actually shortened wars. But most significantly, Fox questions the essence of US precision warfare: the belief that smart bombs spare a need for boots on the ground. ""Accurate strikes are not equivalent to effective strikes,"" he wrote. In other words, a strike can land on the intended area, selected based on intelligence, and yet fail to achieve the goal of, say, killing a militant leader or stopping a factory from making more bombs, hence necessitating follow-on strikes. When PGMs don't accomplish the mission, ""then precision-based warfighting requires additional strikes and, likely, a subsequent use of land force activities to offset the shortcomings of precision strikes."" This can actually result in higher civilian casualties than if conventional weapons had been used in the first place because it requires repeated attacks. ""If precision strikes are often accurate, but ineffective, and additional strikes or land operations are required to create the effect intended with the initial precision strikes, then precision strategies do not decrease civilian casualties and collateral damage in conflict zones."" Fox points to the extensive use of American PGMs during the ferocious battles of Raqqa and Mosul in 2016-2017. In trying to root out heavily fortified Islamic State positions dug into civilian neighborhoods, many buildings were destroyed and thousands killed. Israel faces a similar situation today as it hunts Hamas in Gaza. Thus the paradox: an individual PGM may be more accurate than a dumb bomb. But if a PGM fails to knock out a target — whether due to poor intelligence or the pure chance that reigns on battlefields — more guided weapons have to be launched, thus defeating the whole purpose of precision. ""Accurate strikes do not inherently mean effective,"" Fox told Business Insider. ""Therefore, more strikes are required when a strike does not effectively accomplish its intended purpose. Thus, in the aggregate, if a PGM isn't 100 percent effective, it can often result in similar outcomes to ballistic artillery, or other non-precision munition employment."" Fox doesn't believe that smarter bombs will solve the paradox. ""Better PGMs isn't really the problem,"" he said. ""PGMs are currently about as accurate as can be. For that matter, although artillery is an area fire weapon, it is still very accurate."" But what about the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, in which massive amounts of PGMs are being employed? In Ukraine, both sides are using massive numbers of guided weapons, at a rate that is depleting stockpiles and factory capacity, yet neither side has managed to achieve decisive results. Israel carried out strikes in Gaza against 29,000 targets in the first four months of the war, often with guided weapons, but that has failed so far to destroy Hamas. ""The lesson is that Hamas is a land force,"" said Fox. ""The inconvenient truth about war is that it still requires a land force to defeat a land force. Precision warfare, which isn't really a thing, augments a land force in defeating another land force. It doesn't replace it.""

12,Taylor Rains,"I toured American's pilot training academy, where new hires learn to fly Airbus and Boeing jets. Here's what the 3-week program looks like.",https://www.businessinsider.com/american-airlines-flight-academy-pilot-training-simulators-2024-6,"American Airlines requires thousands of flight hours just to get hired, but newly hired pilots must complete weeks of training before flying passengers.",2024-06-08T10:18:01Z,"Airline pilots, who are responsible for hundreds of lives daily, dedicate years of training and studying to earn their seats in the cockpit. Most start their careers flying smaller jets at regional airlines and build up to flying Airbus and Boeing planes at the mainline carriers. Before they can fly passengers, however, new hires must complete weeks of ground and simulator training. I recently toured the flight academy at American's headquarters in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, with Alan Johnson, American's managing director of flight training and standards and veteran captain. ""It's not a cakewalk; it's challenging,"" he said. ""We put our pilots into stressful situations, and that's good because when they leave here, we want them to not only have the competence but the confidence to go out into the operation and do what the airline asked them to do."" Johnson said about 2,100 new pilots were hired by American in 2023, who joined the company's roster of some 15,000 others. Most new hires will train to fly American's Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 family narrowbody airplanes. To earn their type rating, they must spend 19 days completing ground and simulator training, Johnson said.  The first half of the new hire course includes eight days of ground school, followed by an evaluation day.  The flight academy, which is open 365/24/7, has several classrooms and ""visual flight trainers"" that new hires use during the ground course to prepare for the FAA-approved tests. ""You need to show you can do things like set up different types of approaches and complete an originating pre-flight,"" Johnson said. Once new hires complete the first phase of training, Johnson said they will spend five days in American's giant, multimillion-dollar full-motion simulators. The 39-strong fleet of simulators is as close as possible trainees can get to flying a real jet from the ground. These machines can simulate nearly every possible movement in a passenger jetliner, such as turbulence, wind shear, and landing. The latter involves a pitch-down motion to make it feel like the trainees are stopping. ""We want trainees to feel really confident with their skillset to fly around weather, be able to make the decision to divert, and know what to do when they have a medical emergency,"" he said, among other responsibilities. American let me experience a Boeing 787 Dreamliner simulator and its full movement. It was as realistic as I imagined, simulating everything from takeoff and cruise to emergency alarms and landing. A 787 instructor flew a simulated trip from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Mount Rainer and back, showing me how pilots use systems like the heads-up display, the flaps, and the autopilot. Johnson said the training sessions last four hours and are split into two two-hour blocks with a short break in between. Two new hires will train together and switch between the roles of pilot monitoring and pilot flying. Simulator training covers every phase of flight, with some sessions focusing on specific scenarios, such as go-arounds, slow flight situations, and steep turns. Instructors will also throw emergency situations at the new hires, like engine and generator failures, flaps that don't extend properly, and pitot tubes that get blocked and give an unreliable airspeed. ""You've got sirens and clackers that you cannot silence, all those distractions,"" Johnson said, who has about 20,000 hours of flight time under his belt piloting everything from the MD-80 to the 787. ""We train for all of it."" After those five days, the new hires will complete a few more evaluations before operating a simulated gate-to-gate roundtrip flight. This is all in preparation for the final type-rating test, which is conducted by the FAA at the academy in partnership with American. Once pilots pass all of their necessary checks and have their type rating on the jet they trained to fly, they start their ""operating experience,"" or OE. Johnson said OE involves flying 25 hours of revenue passenger flights with a check airman, who is a specific instructor authorized to conduct line evaluations. ""All of the new hires we trained at American in 2023, 96% of them went through training without any additional time,"" he said. ""That's a testament to our instructors."" Still, the schooling never stops. Veteran pilots complete recurrent training every year to maintain their proficiency and skills. Their seniority at American — and at Delta and United, for that matter — comes with a pretty paycheck. At the US' three largest airlines, new-hire pilots start with a base pay of $116 per hour, or $111,000 yearly. 12-year widebody captains can make up to $447 per hour, or about $430,000 a year. That's before per diem, bonuses, and other extra pay. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights. Times Syndication Service."
13,Laura Italiano,Tough-on-crime former NYC judges say even they wouldn't sentence Trump to prison in the hush-money case,https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-judges-weigh-in-on-trump-hush-money-sentencing-2024,Will Justice Juan Merchan treat Trump like any other first offender? Will his hijinks count against him? We asked 4 ex-NYC judges what they would do.,2024-06-08T10:00:01Z,"The pundits are pondering: what will happen when Donald Trump is sentenced? Will New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan treat Trump like any other older first offender with non-violent, low-level felonies, and give him a no-jail sentence — an option that moots Secret Service security concerns and blunts further cries of ""election interference?"" Or will Merchan factor in all the extra stuff — Trump's courtroom outbursts, his 10 gag violations, his civil judgments for sex assault and billion-dollar fraud, his targeting of the judge's own daughter — and sentence him to less than a year in Rikers or more than a year in state prison? Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has not revealed what he'll ask for on July 11, when Trump is scheduled to be sentenced to anywhere from zero to 4 years for each of 34 counts of falsifying business records. Bragg has yet to even tell his own prosecutors, the ones who tried and won the hush-money case, what sentence he'll ask for, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Merchan, of course, won't tip his hand until the sentencing itself. So, Business Insider did the next best thing. We side-stepped the pundit industrial complex and its army of former prosecutors and think-tankers. We instead asked a few of Merchan's former colleagues on New York City's criminal trial bench, the closest thing to the horse's — or judge's — mouth. Will Merchan sentence Donald Trump to jail? To prison? What would they have done as judges had Trump's case been theirs? Four former New York City judges, all reputed to be as tough or tougher than Merchan, shared their answers. All four said a prison sentence — AKA ""state time,"" meaning a sentence of more than one year in an upstate New York prison — is inappropriate. Merchan will not sentence Trump to prison, the four agreed. ""He's certainly not going to give him state time — state time is really a lot,"" said Michael Obus, who was Merchan's supervising judge in Manhattan from 2009 to 2017. ""The prosecution has gotten its pound of flesh just by getting its conviction,"" agreed Barry Kamins, a former Brooklyn-based state supreme court justice and ex-administrative judge for the city criminal courts. ""We all know who Trump is and what he does,"" said Charles Solomon, a Manhattan-based state supreme court justice for 33 years before his retirement in 2017. ""But you don't want to give him such a draconian sentence that he becomes a martyr,"" Solomon said. ""Trump would be re-elected in a landslide if they put him for one day in jail,"" he added. ""Plus, this guy doesn't belong in jail for what he did. Let's face it, enough is enough already."" Three out of the four former judges who spoke to BI go even further, predicting that Merchan won't give Trump a jail sentence either, meaning no ""city time"" — a term of less than one year in New York's notorious Rikers Island. Merchan could theoretically sentence Trump to as little as a single day in Rikers, said Kamins, now in private practice at Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins. A 30-day sentence, to be served at Rikers on 15 consecutive weekends, is a more reasonable low-jail option in Merchan's toolbox, noted Solomon. But Trump shouldn't expect even this sort of short, symbolic jail sentence, said Kamins, Solomon, and a third former Manhattan judge who asked not to be named due to an ongoing connection to the courts. ""This is not a case where jail should even be considered,"" said that former judge, one of the few Republicans on the Manhattan bench in recent decades. In sentencing, both aggravating and mitigating factors are weighed, this judge noted. ""You have to consider the impact that a sentence will have on others,"" the former judge said. ""And in this case that means the impact the sentence will have on the entire nation. A national election is hanging in the balance,"" where any time spent in jail keeps Trump off the campaign trail, the former judge said. ""If this gets reversed"" on appeal, they added, ""the damage will already be done, and this judge cannot be oblivious to that."" Only one judge — Obus, the former Manhattan administrative judge — declined to rule out jail altogether, calling it a possibility, though a slight one. What might tip the scales in favor of jail? Trump's motive. Prosecutors can be expected to argue at sentencing, as they did in opening statements and closing arguments, that Trump falsified business records as part of a 2016 election-interference scheme with the National Enquirer. The supermarket tabloid ran fake stories attacking Trump's political opponents — including one doozy that accused Ted Cruz of keeping ""five mistresses"" — while buying and burying salacious stories that hurt Trump, trial evidence showed. ""This scheme, cooked up by these men at this time, could very well be what got President Trump elected,"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors in closing arguments. Merchan will weigh this attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election during sentencing, Obus noted. ""One possibility is some kind of split sentence, say, six months of jail with a concurrent sentence of five years probation,"" said Obus, a member of the new statewide commission on prosecutorial conduct. But even in the unlikely event of a low-jail sentence, Trump's appeals would keep him at liberty for years, all four judges said. ""I've kept a client out as long as six years, pursuing appeals,"" said veteran Manhattan defense lawyer Ron Kuby. ""No one is going to incarcerate a former president of the United States until his appeals are exhausted,"" said Kuby. ""You cannot plausibly argue that Donald Trump is a risk of flight,"" Kuby added. ""Now, you may wish that he flee,"" he joked. ""But he is not a flight risk."" Merchan has the power to immediately stay any incarceratory sentence himself, Obus noted. Short of jail, Trump can be fined up to $5,000 for each of the 34 records-falsification counts he was found guilty of, Obus said. Merchan can also order community service, to be monitored by the judge himself or through the city probation department. ""If you're older or handicapped, they won't send you out into the parks to pick up garbage,"" Solomon said. ""They'll have you licking envelopes somewhere,"" he said. ""Maybe in Trump's case, they'll have him lecture somewhere about how you should not commit crimes,"" he added. ""He could go to Harvard Business School and lecture about the importance of not falsifying business records."" A term of three or five years probation would not be surprising, the former judges said. ""It's basically nothing,"" Solomon said. ""You have to meet with your probation officer initially, and then you have to go to a kiosk every now and then, and log in, to make sure you're OK and still around."" Trump can easily have his probation transferred to Florida — or Washington, DC. — the judges also noted. ""If you go by the statistics for people sentenced for this kind of crime, the most common sentence is probation,"" said Kamins. ""Judge Merchan, we know, takes white-collar crime very seriously, and he may choose probation — which is the most serious non-jail punishment — only because of his feelings on white-collar crime,"" Kamins added. It's a historic moment, the first sentencing of a former president. But given what will be an aggressively-fought appeal, Merchan may want to keep his comments brief, and focused on the conviction alone, the former judges said. Merchan has already punished Trump's ten acts of contempt of court — his gag order violations — by imposing a total $10,000 in fines. Dwelling on these violations as he explains his sentence to Trump could give the defense a basis for challenging the punishment as vindictive and repetitive, the former judges said. But Trump's history of civil fraud and sex-abuse judgments is fair game for Merchan to mention at sentencing, they said. Rehashing Trump's spoken and online attacks on the judge, the judge's family, and the criminal justice system is also fair game. ""He looks like an angel, but he's really a devil,"" Trump said of Merchan during a press conference just one day after his verdict. But less is more, the former judges said, especially if Merchan wants to limit Trump's ability to appeal the sentence by claiming it was based on the judge's personal and political animus. ""You can go down the list, as a judge, and say he doesn't pay the people he hires, he doesn't do this, he doesn't do that,"" Solomon said of Merchan's sentencing statement. ""But if you start making a list of how bad he is, and then you give him a light sentence, you look like an idiot,"" he said. ""Most of the time, the less you say the better,"" Solomon added. ""You speak a couple of sentences. You say, 'I have weighed the facts of the case, and I think the appropriate sentence under the law is as follows.'"" Ultimately, the judges said, Merchan will give it a good deal of thought, and then do what he sees is best. ""I certainly don't know what the right decision is, or what Judge Merchan will do,"" Obus told BI. ""I just know that he is thoughtful, and wise, and fair. And I'm sure he'll consider the appropriate factors and whatever he does will be the right decision,"" he said. ""That's how I'm going to find out what the right decision is,"" he added with a laugh.

Yes, there are awards for funny photos of people's pets. And yes, they are hilarious. In today's big story, we're looking at the startups attempting to do the impossible: take on Nvidia. What's on deck: But first, you come at the king, you best not miss. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The house always wins in Las Vegas. But in Silicon Valley, it's Nvidia holding all the chips. Literally. Nvidia's dominant position as the AI chipmaker is undeniable, but that hasn't stopped some optimistic entrepreneurs from taking a shot at the crown. Business Insider's Alistair Barr has a rundown of the AI chip startups looking to challenge Nvidia. For many experts in the space, it's a fool's errand. Put more bluntly, a VC told Alistair that betting against Nvidia is ""a very stupid investment."" OK, but tell me how you really feel. The pessimism for newcomers in the space isn't unwarranted, as they face plenty of headwinds. The AI chipmaking process requires lots of money — some startups have raised well north of $100 million — and time. That's a tough equation when the competition you're chasing is growing market share and making money hand-over-fist while its CEO is treated like a rock star. So why even bother? A tiny fraction of a $3 trillion business — roughly Nvidia's market cap — is still a lot of money. So even if a startup can't go head-to-head with Nvidia, carving out a small portion of its market share isn't too shabby. The biggest threat to Nvidia isn't startups, though. When your stock looks like a vertical line, it gets people's attention. For Nvidia, that reportedly means regulators are taking a closer look. The Justice Department is preparing to investigate Nvidia's dominance and whether it violates antitrust laws, according to a recent report from The New York Times. That could enable upstarts to gain some ground. As much as Silicon Valley loves to denounce regulation, it has, in a roundabout way, led to some innovation. Take the DOJ's antitrust case against Microsoft in the late '90s, a turning point for tech companies like Google and Apple. You'll be hard-pressed to find tech companies cheering on regulators, but they probably wouldn't mind Nvidia facing some competition. Some have already teamed up to break Nvidia's stranglehold on the market. Even if these AI chip startups eventually fail, they could still do the industry good. A little competition can keep those in front from getting too stagnant…or greedy. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Kyiv Independent reporter Asami Terajima told Business Insider that she spoke to a medic called Oleksii who treats soldiers at a stabilization point near the frontline near Chasiv Yar before they are transported to hospitals. The majority of Oleksii's patients in the past six months were injured by FPV (first-person-view) drones, Terajima said. The strategic city of Chasiv Yar has been the target of a Russian offensive since December. Russian troops have steadily advanced westward from the ruins of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, seizing a dozen small villages and nearing Chasiv Yar and a key highway to the south. Terajima said that FPV drone warfare was a major feature of the fighting in the Donetsk Oblast, particularly in the Bakhmut area. She said that in other parts of the eastern front, Ukrainian soldiers were being overwhelmed with glide bombs. ""The soldiers in the Avdiivka area were complaining a lot about the glide bombs that are now very intensively still being used,"" she told BI. Russia stepped up its use of glide bombs in October when it launched its offensive against Avdiivka. Powerful bombs are transformed into glide weapons by adding modified fins and guidance systems. They are launched at a distance from fighter planes and are difficult to spot on radar and shoot down. Terajima said that Ukrainian soldiers told her during the last days before the fall of Avdiivka in February, Russian forces were dropping about 60 glide bombs a day. ""Ukrainian soldiers are barely able to visit their families, and it's really demoralizing when Russian forces intensify the use of glide bombs,"" Terajima said. ""They're really, really scary."" However, some NATO members recently lifted the restrictions on Ukraine using their advanced weapons to strike military targets inside Russia, giving Ukraine new battlefield options in combatting the glide bombs. ""These policy changes will allow Ukrainian forces to use Western-provided systems to strike Russian firing and staging areas in Russia's border areas and airspace,"" conflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War wrote. Terajima recently reported on the difficult frontline situation for Ukraine near the Donestk village of Ivanivske in mid-May. The settlement, strategically located between Bakhmut and Chasiv Yar, is now under severe threat, she said. Russian forces began their assault on Ivanivske in February, and by April, they controlled the main roads. Despite fierce house-to-house fighting, Ukrainian troops are gradually being pushed out. She said that while the Ukrainian military is determined to present the ongoing battle as under control, holding Ivanivske would be difficult. ""In Ivanivske, everything is destroyed, and there's nowhere to hide,"" Terajima told BI. ""You can't build a trench because there's the concrete underneath that prevents you from digging further."" Lieutenant Colonel Nazar Voloshyn, a spokesperson for the Khortytsia grouping in the region, denied that Ivanivske was on the verge of falling. Terajima told BI that Ukraine is resolved to maintain a resilient image and that her coverage detailing Ukraine's losses is therefore considered ""taboo"" and ""provocative"" because it taints that image. ""Russia's forces are sustaining heavy losses, but they are still advancing at a rate that we don't like,"" Terajima said. By downplaying these advances, ""we're basically turning away from the reality, not allowing the public to understand what's going on,"" she said. ""I think that no matter what, we need to always be honest and say it out how it is. And if we have heavy losses, then I think that has to be told.""

16,Jake Epstein,"Like the F-16, French Mirage 2000-5 fighters are good planes, but they aren't the best Western jets for Ukraine",https://www.businessinsider.com/mirage-fighter-jets-good-planes-arent-best-western-aircraft-ukraine-2024-6,Experts have said that Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen would be a more suitable Western combat aircraft for Ukrainian forces.,2024-06-08T12:17:01Z,"Ukraine is slated to receive Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets from France in the coming months, adding another aircraft to Kyiv's coming arsenal of Western combat planes. French President Emmanuel Macron announced Thursday that France will provide Kyiv with the Mirage fighter aircraft after training pilots how to fly the warplanes through a program that will begin this summer. He added that Paris will build a coalition with other countries to supply the jets and that Ukraine could even be flying them by the end of the year. Macron's announcement comes as Ukraine eagerly awaits the seemingly imminent arrival of American-made F-16s, which will be Kyiv's first Western fighter jet. Four NATO countries promised to send these fighters. The Mirage 2000-5, like its F-16 counterpart, is a good fourth-generation fighter jet that will bring some additional capabilities to Ukraine's fleet of aging Soviet-era warplanes. But neither aircraft is necessarily the best fit for Kyiv given the current battlefield conditions. With next-gen systems not even up for discussion, the plane that is most suitable for Ukraine remains Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen. But it is also out of reach, at least for the time being. The Mirage is a multi-role, delta-winged fourth-gen fighter jet manufactured by French company Dassault Aviation. Around 600 of these aircraft have been produced since it was designed in the late 1970s, and they are currently operated by a small number of militaries, including Greece and Taiwan. Like the F-16, the Mirage 2000s are combat-proven aircraft, having flown sorties in conflicts across the Middle East and in the Balkans. The 2000-5 variant, which is what France has promised to send Ukraine, first flew in 1990 and, compared to previous versions of the aircraft, features an upgraded radar system. The jet can be equipped with air-to-surface and air-to-air missiles, as well as laser-guided bombs. Macron told French broadcasters on Thursday that the pilot training will begin this summer and take place in France. The program typically lasts around five to six months, he said, and an undisclosed number of Mirage jets will be transferred to Ukraine following the completion of that training. Under normal conditions, the French Mirage 2000-5 would be perfectly suitable for a country like Ukraine, but that's just not the situation right now, Justin Bronk, an airpower and technology expert at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, told Business Insider. The effectiveness of the Mirage 2000-5 is primarily limited by the MICA beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, which has a much shorter range than the AIM-120 AMRAAM variants that Kyiv could use with its F-16s, Bronk said. And the AMRAAM is already an unsatisfactory tool to address Russian air threats near the front lines because Moscow's formidable ground-based surface-to-air missile systems force Ukrainian fighters to fly at relatively low altitudes, putting limitations on the effectiveness of their missiles, Bronk said. Investing resources to get Ukraine another Western fighter that has an even shorter air-to-air reach won't necessarily improve this dilemma. The Mirage can carry powerful long-range cruise missiles like the French-made SCALP-EG, but those can also be launched from Ukraine's existing fighter fleet and have already been used to great effect. Additionally, Bronk said, Ukrainian pilots who are able to be trained quickly on operating and maintaining a system as complex as a fighter jet are also in extremely limited supply. Many of these individuals are already training on the F-16 at sites in Europe and the US. Doug Birkey, the executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, told BI that the Mirage is an ""older capability"" on par with what Ukraine is getting out of the F-16. Rather than split the focus between aircraft, creating new supply lines, maintenance processes and diverting resources, some NATO partners have argued it might make more sense to simply stick to the F-16. Like the F-16, the French fighter jet's effectiveness, he said, will ultimately come down to how it's used and whether Kyiv can strike inside Russian territory. Last month, Macron said Ukraine should be allowed to use Western weapons to do so, a stance more NATO countries are taking. ""It's very difficult to try to win and succeed in the campaign when you're largely stuck to defense,"" Birkey said. Air warfare experts like Bronk have argued throughout the conflict in Ukraine that the most suitable Western combat aircraft for Ukrainian forces would be Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen. Built by Swedish defense and aerospace firm Saab, the Gripen is a 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft that has been in production since the 1980s. The Swedish fighter jet was designed with the idea of a dispersed fighter force taking on Russia without having the benefits of being in NATO and facing a very dangerous surface-to-air missile threat. Essentially, it was designed for the exact conditions in which Ukraine is fighting. Sweden's Gripen is considered by experts to be a highly capable, effective, and efficient fighter. It is relatively inexpensive to operate, easy to maintain, and requires less runway space than some other aircraft for taking off and landing. The jet also features advanced electronic-warfare capabilities that were specifically designed to be able to counter the radars on Russian aircraft and ground-based air-defense systems. Furthermore, the Gripen can be equipped with various air-to-surface missiles and bombs, as well as longer-range air-to-air missiles. Among the latter is the Meteor air-to-air missile, which, with a range of up to 80 miles, delivers a much longer reach than the French MICA and even some Russian weaponry. Compared to the F-16 and Mirage, the Gripen is far more flexible in terms of operational requirements — especially when it comes to cost and maintenance — and is more resource-efficient. The downsides of the Swedish aircraft are that it has yet to see combat and is rather limited in availability, unlike the F-16 and its support systems, which are available across Europe. Sweden previously explored sending Gripens to Ukraine, but those considerations were recently put on hold to allow Kyiv to focus on the F-16. But France has announced its intention to send the Mirage, seemingly contradicting this rationale. ""Why you would then have another non-F-16 fighter being supplied that is less effective for Ukraine's requirements and less well-suited in every way than the Gripen seems slightly odd,"" Bronk said. Ukrainian officials have long pushed for the West to provide fighter aircraft, and regardless of any drawbacks, they have expressed their delight publicly over both the F-16 and Mirage pledges. ""French combat aircraft — brilliant fighter jets that, under the control of Ukrainian pilots, will prove that Europe is stronger,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a Friday speech to France's National Assembly, referring to the Mirages. Until these aircraft arrive, though, Ukraine will have to continue making do with its Soviet-era fleet. For Kyiv, any Western deliveries may prove valuable — regardless of the type of aircraft. ""The best fighter they can get are the ones they can get,"" Birkey argued. ""It still remains that."" France's announcement on its plans to send Mirage fighters comes as Kyiv's partners step up their support for the country in the wake of Russia's new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Macron on Thursday also revealed plans to train and equip a brigade of 4,500 Ukrainian soldiers, which will be a significant development and a notable break from some previous training schemes. ""One of the biggest problems that Ukraine is currently facing is a lack of training capacity, particularly the capacity to train at a larger unit level, so battalions and brigades, rather than companies and smaller,"" Bronk said. Instead of offering lots of short courses for smaller numbers of troops — a strategy that showed its limitations during Kyiv's failed counteroffensive last summer because it didn't generate officers — the French plan offers a way for Ukrainian troops to train as a unified formation with standardized equipment, Bronk said. That, he added, ""is an incredibly useful and an incredibly well-thought-out way of increasing and stabilizing long-term support. That's really potentially impactful.""

17,Cameron Manley,The door is staying shut on Ukraine joining NATO because it would weaken Biden's chances of getting reelected,https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-joining-nato-would-weaken-bidens-reelection-chances-2024-6,Ukraine has signed 15 bilateral security agreements with NATO members in recent months. Experts say they are worthless without NATO membership.,2024-06-08T13:04:19Z,"US President Joe Biden appears to have drawn a line beneath Ukraine's bid for NATO membership. In an interview with Time Magazine this week, the US president said he was not prepared to support the ""NATOization of Ukraine,"" adding that he had witnessed ""significant corruption"" in Ukraine when he visited as vice president. ""Peace,"" Biden said, ""doesn't mean NATO."" Rather, a part of the condition for peace in Ukraine was building relations with Kyiv, including security guarantees which would lead to a situation ""where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future."" Biden said, ""Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine."" It comes as a blow to Ukrainian officials who have consistently pushed for a swift entry to NATO after the war's conclusion. Earlier this week, a report by the Financial Times revealed that Ukraine's lack of progress toward NATO membership was a key issue creating tension in US-Ukrainian relations. Ukrainian hopes are now pinned on the NATO meeting in Washington, scheduled for July 9-11, to bring a more definite signal for Ukraine's post-war membership. The US ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, told reporters last month that Kyiv is unlikely to receive a membership invitation at the alliance's July summit, promising to offer a security package as a ""bridge"" to membership. This bridge ""will be well-lit and made of steel, and we will do everything we can to help our friends from Ukraine, step by step, walk across that bridge to membership eventually."" However, refusing to move forward with an accelerated membership plan leaves Ukraine's hopes for NATO membership in the lurch. Leo Litra, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider, ""Biden is trying to solidify the idea for the US public that the US is not getting involved so he doesn't weaken his chances of getting reelected."" Referring to Biden's TIME Magazine comments, Litra said, ""No one in NATO and especially not in the US, wants to have to test Article 5."" NATO's Article 5 upholds the principle of collective defense and would compel the US and Western nations to commit their military forces to defend Ukraine. For now, Ukraine has to settle for a range of ""security guarantees."" In addition to a G7 Joint Declaration made at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July last year, Ukraine has signed 15 bilateral security agreements with NATO member countries. All the agreements contain various pledges for the current year as well as boilerplate provisions for the duration of the deal. Stefan Meister, head of the Eastern Europe program at the German Council on Foreign Relations, told BI that the failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer was a major wake-up call for the international community. Meister said these packages will provide Ukraine with ""more reliable long-term military and security support by NATO member states."" Some Ukrainian officials believe these guarantees are a ""game changer."" Just after Ukraine signed a security agreement with the UK in January, Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Ukraine's security council chief, wrote in The Economist, ""Agreements on security co-operation are gradually moving Ukraine into the Western security space, without requiring the presence of Western troops on Ukrainian soil."" He added: ""Such agreements create the basis for Ukraine's accession to NATO, which was decided on back in 2008 in Bucharest,"" when NATO welcomed Ukraine's aspirations to join the alliance. A US State Department spokesperson confirmed to BI that a US-Ukraine security agreement was in the works. ""Our bilateral security arrangements will be focused on supporting Ukraine's defense in Putin's war of choice, building the credible deterrence capabilities of Ukraine's future force, and providing emergency response options in the event of future Russian aggression,"" the spokesperson said. One confirmed offer that will come at this year's July summit will be an agreement from NATO to Ukraine to expand cooperation in defence technology and intelligence exchange regarding Russia's electronic warfare capabilities, NATO Assistant Secretary General David van Weel told reporters Tuesday. However, Meister said that the lack of stable military aid commitments beyond 2024 ""reflects the current challenges faced by Ukraine and its allies and divisions within NATO."" He said these packages are a reaction to the situation that there is no agreement among the member states for NATO integration. Each NATO member state has to do ""more planning for long-term support for Ukraine"" on its own back. Zelenskyy's office did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Although there have been strong demonstrations of support for Ukraine from NATO allies, experts warn that these guarantees carry little weight without the promise of full membership. ""Without NATO membership for Ukraine, security guarantees for Ukraine are blatant lies,"" Canadian analyst Michael MacKay wrote on X. ""Keeping Ukraine out of NATO serves the interests of the Russian terrorist state only."" Litra said, ""Ukraine relied on a similar 'guarantee' without legal mechanisms under the Budapest Memorandum,"" Litra said, referring to the 1994 security assurances in which Ukraine was required to hand over its nuclear arsenal in exchange for protection from the United States, the UK, and Russia. ""But this Memorandum did nothing to prevent the war."" While Ukraine and some NATO members see these agreements as ""instruments to prepare Ukraine for NATO membership in the future,"" Litra said that ""the overall feeling, especially in the US and Germany is that Ukraine's accession to NATO would be an escalation for Russia."" According to Meister, ""There is no alternative to NATO integration."" These guarantees are ""the second best options Ukraine can get at this moment. They could lead to a NATO integration, but we are still far away from this,"" Meister said. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

18,Sinéad Baker,Ukraine is working on its own glide bombs — the ones it got from the US often don't work,https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-making-own-bombs-counter-russian-devastation-us-ones-jam-2024-6,"A Ukrainian air force official said his country is working on converting and producing its own glide bombs, with testing due to start in a few weeks.",2024-06-10T11:39:15Z,"Ukraine is making its own glide bombs, trying to match the Russian weapon that is causing so much damage. The hope is that they will be more effective than the ones it has so far received from the West. Brigadier General Serhii Holubtsov, chief of aircraft of the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said Ukraine will start testing the domestically made bombs in the next few weeks. ""We are now working on converting and producing our own corrected bombs based on conventional freefall bombs,"" he said in a radio interview, according to a translation by Ukrainian Pravda. The bombs, otherwise known as glide bombs, have guidance systems that allow them to be launched at a distance. They have emerged as a major weapon in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russian aircraft are able to release the bombs at a safe distance, making it very hard for Ukraine to stop them. Russia has escalated their use over the past few months, giving it a notable military advantage. Russia has been using them to pound the Kharkiv region, where it launched a major offensive last month. Many experts consider the bombs to have been crucial in Russia taking the city of Avdiivka in February, in what was its first major victory in months. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last month that Russia was using more than 3,000 of the bombs each month against Ukraine. The West has given Ukraine some glide bombs to use against Russia, but Reuters reported last month that ones supplied by the US have struggled against Russian jamming. This means that many have missed their targets, three sources told Reuters. Holubtsov said there are many complex decisions to be made regarding Ukraine's homemade bombs, including ""picking the appropriate wing, GPS module, and control module."" ""In a few weeks, we should begin testing the first batches of these bombs, which are Ukrainian-made,"" he said. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

19,Tom Porter,The US is still holding Ukraine back by limiting what it can take out on Russian soil: ISW,https://www.businessinsider.com/us-still-holding-back-ukraine-with-russia-strikes-limit-isw-2024-6,"Ukraine is able to use US weapons to hit targets in Russia, but under strict limits.",2024-06-10T11:40:03Z,"Ukraine appears to have had only minor success in using US-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia because of the strict limits imposed by President Joe Biden. Last month, Biden said that Ukraine could fire US weapons against targets on Russian soil, in limited circumstances. The change in policy came after Ukraine's European allies, including the UK, lifted bans on their weapons being used to strike Russia directly. However, the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said in its daily report that, under the rules, Ukraine could only strike around 16% of Russian territory within the range of weapons supplied by the US. ""US policy restricting Ukraine's usage of US-provided weapons has effectively created a vast sanctuary – territory in range of US-provided weapons but that Ukrainian forces are not allowed to strike with US-provided weapons – which Russia exploits to shield its combat forces, command and control, logistics, and rear area support services that the Russian military uses to conduct its military operations in Ukraine,"" said the ISW. Biden's directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used to strike military targets inside Russia that are attacking or preparing to attack Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. However, according to the ISW, because a large number of Russian military targets remain off-limits, Ukraine is still unable to disrupt Russian military operations significantly. ""ISW assesses that the West maintains the ability to substantially disrupt Russian operations at scale by allowing Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike Russia's operational rear and deep rear areas in Russian territory,"" said the ISW. Biden has taken a cautious approach to how much support the US should give Ukraine, fearing an escalation of the conflict that could pull in NATO powers. Russia had exploited the restrictions placed on Ukraine to launch devastating attacks from its territory on Kharkiv, which is around 12 miles from the Russian border.

20,Lindsay Dodgson,The crucial skills for middle managers to survive the 'great unbossing',https://www.businessinsider.com/soft-skills-help-middle-managers-survive-the-great-unbossing-2024-6,"Developing better soft skills, including empathy, communication, and emotional intelligence are key for middle managers to survive being axed.",2024-06-10T10:08:09Z,"Middle managers have been the punching bag of the workplace for some time, with employees increasingly seeing their direct superiors as meddlesome, obsolete, and taking credit for their work. But it shouldn't be a matter of axing middle management entirely, Koma Gandy, the VP of business and leadership at the corporate training platform Skillsoft, told Business Insider. Rather, we need to remember what makes a middle manager valuable. The answer, Gandy said, lies in developing better soft ""power"" skills. With improved communication and listening, more empathy, and emotional intelligence, middle managers could save themselves from the ""great unbossing,"" Gandy said. But that requires leaders to take note and start investing in managers to help them nurture these skills as well. ""I would say, why don't we lean into that cohort rather than thinking about how can we eliminate that cohort?"" Gandy said. Companies have been axing middle management positions as a way to cut costs. Their reduction has also been in response to Gen Z's distaste for management and how office culture has shifted with remote working. Proponents of ""unbossing"" believe it could make Gen Zers who are entering the workforce better at their jobs by giving them more autonomy. But this is short-sighted, Gandy said. For starters, middle managers provide mentorship to junior employees and graduate staffers. Zoomers entering the workforce prioritize their own mental health and work-life balance, and a good manager is someone who also makes these things a primary concern, Gandy argued. ""Some of the things that Gen Z is demanding from the workplace can be uniquely facilitated by the very people that the trend is trying to eliminate, which are these middle managers,"" Gandy said. Good middle managers need training and guidance, which is severely lacking in current workplaces, Gandy said. Many people, a few years into their careers, will fall into management positions almost by default. They are often expected to know how to effectively do the job without much support. ""It's just congratulations and good luck,"" Gandy said. ""But wait, aren't you going to teach me how to lead a meeting? Aren't you going to teach me how to communicate to a team?"" Key skills for managers to develop include active listening and effective communication, which makes their employees feel valued, that their work matters, and that they are being recognized as whole human beings. If somebody on the team is underperforming, for example, it could be for a myriad of reasons — something is going on at home, they're feeling unsure about what their job is, or where they fit into the company. ""If you don't build up that emotional intelligence to be able to tease out what's happening in that person's environment, you're never going to unlock and unleash the potential that they can bring to their teams,"" Gandy said. A team that has a manager who has developed strong soft skills, ""then you're going to see ripple effects throughout the organization,"" Gandy said. But when these skills are underdeveloped, ""it creates a lot of mistrust"" among team members, Gandy said. ""Nobody wants to be micromanaged. Nobody wants to have somebody sitting over their shoulder,"" she said. Micromanaging often doesn't happen in a vacuum. It may be that a manager doesn't know any different, Gandy said, because that's how they were managed when they were more junior. This manager shouldn't be let go, Gandy said, just because they have a ""faulty toolbox."" No manager comes to work striving to underperform or wanting their team to feel devalued and burned out, she said. ""That's a training deficiency. That is a behavior that can be changed,"" she said. ""If you're not supporting and nurturing them and giving them the tools to develop themselves, then, of course, it might seem attractive to eliminate that cohort."" Middle managers are easy to pick on, Gandy said, but it'll be a lot more cost-effective in the long run for companies to invest in training them in these skills. ""I really think it's a matter of, how do we intentionally develop and expose middle managers to the types of skills and the type of training that they need to be successful,"" she said. ""Rather than throwing that entire cohort away to the detriment of an organization."" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

21,Huileng Tan,"Nvidia is making a ton of money. Now, main supplier TSMC may charge Jensen Huang more for chips.",https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-taiwan-tsmc-ai-chip-price-hike-value-jensen-huang-2024-6,"Nvidia CEO Huang said raising prices is ""very consistent"" with the value TSMC delivers.",2024-06-10T06:49:10Z,"Nvidia's meteoric rise on the back of the AI boom has made it one of the world's most valuable companies and boosted the fortune of CEO Jensen Huang. Now, its key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company appears to want in on the hype. ""I did complain to Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang — the 'three trillion guy' — that his products are so expensive,"" C.C. Wei, TSMC's CEO, said last week, according to Nikkei. Wei was referring to Nvidia's market value, which surpassed $3 trillion last week. The company, which makes AI chips, submitted another blowout earnings report last month, with first-quarter revenue and earnings both beating Wall Street estimates. Wei added that Nvidia's products were ""really valuable for sure"" but that he was thinking of ""showing our values as well."" Wei's comments have sparked speculation that TSMC — the world's largest contract chipmaker — is considering a price hike. TSMC produces, by some estimates, 90% of the world's most advanced processor chips. TSMC sought to tamp down market speculation last week, telling local media that the company's pricing had always been ""strategy-oriented rather than opportunity-oriented."" In April, an analyst asked whether TSMC was reaping the benefits of the AI boom and how the CEO was thinking about pricing. ""We are happy that our customers are doing well. And if customers do well, TSMC does well,"" Wei answered. Nvidia's Huang doesn't appear to mind a price hike from TSMC. He told reporters in Taiwan last week that TSMC's contribution to the industry was ""really great."" ""Raising prices, I think, is consistent with the value that they deliver. And so I'm very happy to see them succeed,"" Huang said. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last week that Nvidia's management probably recognized TSMC's reliability. ""We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow,"" the analysts wrote in a note. They estimated that Nvidia would account for 10% of TSMC's 2024 revenue. It isn't the first time this year that TSMC has signaled a price hike. In April, Wei said the company planned to charge customers more if they wanted their chips made outside Taiwan. ""If my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC and the customer had to share the incremental cost,"" the CEO said on TSMC's first-quarter earnings call. ""In today's fragmented globalization environment, costs will be higher for everyone, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors, and the entire semiconductor industry."" Taiwan also hiked electricity rates for large industrial users in April, which would pressure TSMC's bottom line. Wei said inflation and electricity were leading to higher costs. ""We expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers,"" he said, declining to talk specifics about pricing strategies on the earnings call. Used in everything from data centers to smartphones, chip production is now a geopolitical concern since the world's chip production is concentrated in independently governed Taiwan — which China claims as its own territory. There are fears that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could adversely impact the global economy and allow Beijing to seize TSMC's facilities. TSMC is diversifying production with new facilities in Arizona, Japan, and Germany. Wei said last week that TSMC had discussed moving some chip plants outside Taiwan but that it was impossible to move all production out of the island. TSMC's shares in Taiwan closed 1.7% lower at 879 New Taiwan dollars apiece on Friday and are up 48% year-to-date. The Taiwanese market is closed on Monday for a public holiday. Nvidia shares closed 0.1% lower at $1,208.88 apiece on Friday after gaining over 140% year-to-date — ahead of a 10-for-1 stock split after the closing bell. TSMC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

22,John L. Dorman,DNC is infusing $2 million into state parties in push to win key down-ballot races and boost voter registration efforts,https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-national-committee-state-parties-down-ballot-2024-6,The latest round of funding is part of $20 million in investments that the DNC has made to state parties during the 2024 election cycle.,2024-06-10T10:00:03Z,"The Democratic National Committee is spending nearly $2 million in additional targeted state investments to boost down-ballot candidates and fund critical voter registration efforts ahead of November. The latest round of funding is part of the $20 million in investments the DNC has made in state parties this election cycle. This is a priority for President Joe Biden and party chair Jaime Harrison, even as the commander in chief faces a tough reelection fight against former President Donald Trump. ""Everywhere Democrats are on the ballot this November — from the school board to the White House — we're fighting to win,"" Harrison said in a statement. Indiana and South Dakota are both controlled by Republicans at the statewide level, but the DNC sees them as prime targets for the party's latest investments. In Indiana, the national party is making a five-figure investment to enhance the state party's organizing infrastructure — as local Democrats work to flip four legislative seats and crack the GOP supermajority in the state House of Representatives. As it stands, Democrats hold 30 of 100 seats in the lower chamber. So far, the DNC has given $535,000 to Indiana Democrats this cycle. In South Dakota, national Democrats are investing $70,000 in a critical voter registration program to boost turnout among Native Americans. The investment in the state now totals $477,000. The DNC is also investing additional money for state parties in Colorado, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Washington State. Some of the key down-ballot races the national party will target with the funding are the Maryland Senate contest between Democrat Angela Alsobrooks and former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan and the New Mexico 2nd Congressional District matchup between Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez and ex-GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell. In Texas, the national party will spend an additional $45,000 on organizing efforts to boost voter registration before the fall. Republicans continue to retain their long-standing grip on Texas politics, and Democrats are looking to cultivate support among young and minority voters to counter the GOP edge in the state. Such an effort could prove especially critical in the fall as Democrats see an opportunity in Rep. Colin Allred's Senate candidacy against incumbent Ted Cruz. The Trump campaign announced that it raised $141 million in May alongside the Republican National Committee, with tens of millions of dollars coming in after the former president's criminal conviction in his Manhattan hush-money trial. For much of this year, the RNC was largely strapped for cash, but it remained committed to important down-ballot Senate races in states like Montana and Ohio. It's unclear at this stage how the RNC will respond to Democratic investments in non-presidential battlegrounds, but party leaders largely view Hogan's race as one of their best chances to run a competitive race in a deeply blue state.

23,Theron Mohamed,A recession indicator with a perfect record has been flashing red for 20 months. It may not be wrong yet.,https://www.businessinsider.com/recession-indicator-economy-inverted-yield-curve-campbell-harvey-fed-unemployment-2024-6,"The inverted yield curve has been ringing the recession alarm for 20 months, but past downturns have taken longer, economist Campbell Harvey says.",2024-06-10T12:25:46Z,"A recession indicator with a perfect track record has been flashing red for 20 months now, but the economist who pioneered its use warned against dismissing it just yet. ""I think it's way too early to declare a failure,"" Campbell Harvey told Fox Business about the inverted yield curve. The 3-month Treasury yield has climbed above the 10-year yield before eight of the past eight recessions dating back to the 1960s, without any false positives. Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, first identified that pattern over 30 years ago. The same yield curve has been inverted for around 20 months since October 2022. But past recessions have struck with up to a 23-month lag, Harvey noted. ""We're still not out of the woods,"" he said, noting the indicator will only exceed its historical lead time if there's still no downturn by October. Even so, he advised investors not to rely on his alarm bell alone, but to combine it with other measures to gain a fuller picture of the economy's health and outlook. Harvey pointed to several economic ""red flags"" including employment figures for May that were released on Friday. Headline unemployment ticked up to 4%, with Black unemployment jumping from 5.6% to 6.1%. The labor force participation rate also dropped to 62.5% as some people exited the job market. It's worth emphasizing that Harvey has been sounding the recession alarm for a while. Last May, he warned the economy seemed to be slowing and might contract for the next six to nine months. In January, he cautioned a mild downturn could take hold this year. Recession fears have faded in recent weeks, even though GDP growth has slowed from nearly 5% in the third quarter of last year to just 1.3% last quarter, unemployment has edged higher, and inflation has remained well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for months. There was widespread fear of a downturn after inflation spiked to a 40-year high of more than 9% in the summer of 2022, spurring the Fed to raise interest rates from nearly zero to north of 5%. Higher rates deter spending, investing, and hiring, and increase monthly debt payments owed by consumers and businesses, which tends to cool the economy and boost the risk of a recession. It may be tempting to dismiss Harvey's inverted yield curve as a false alarm, but it's certainly worth monitoring. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

All signs point to Apple confirming the rumors of an OpenAI partnership. It wouldn't be the first time Apple announced a deal with a fellow tech company that has massive implications, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. In 2005, Apple and Google struck a deal to make the latter's search engine the default option on Apple's Safari browser. Two years later, Apple introduced the iPhone with Google as the core search tool. The rest, as they say, is history. It's unclear if the expected Apple-OpenAI partnership will last as long as Apple's nearly two-decade relationship with Google. As beneficial as OpenAI is for Apple, it doesn't come without risks. The startup and CEO Sam Altman are, to put it mildly, in the midst of some chaos. OpenAI has faced criticism over transparency and safety protocols, and people have started questioning Altman's true motivations. Apple usually tries to avoid that type of drama. Remember how quickly it pulled that iPad ad? Further complicating matters is that OpenAI's biggest backer happens to be a key rival of Apple: Microsoft. The fellow tech giant reportedly has reservations about the Apple-OpenAI tie-up. CEO Satya Nadella met with Altman to discuss how the deal might impact his company's AI plans involving the startup, The Information reported. Apple likely won't be interested in putting all its AI eggs in one basket anyway. As successful as the partnership with Google has been, it didn't come cheap. And more importantly, it led to plenty of regulatory attention Apple would probably like to avoid this time around.

25,Cheyenne Lentz,Interior designers reveal 13 things worth splurging on in your living room,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-buy-for-living-room-interior-designers-worth-it-2022-6,"To make their living spaces comfortable and practical, design experts don't mind paying more for things like high-quality sofas and window treatments.",2024-06-11T14:19:59Z,"Though we all love to save money when it comes to decorating our homes, there are some pieces that are worth spending a little more on, according to professionals.  Business Insider asked three interior designers which living-room items are deserving of a splurge.  The sofa is the most important piece of furniture in the living room, according to Rachel Street, an interior designer who hosted DIY Network's ""Philly Revival."" ""This is a good place to spend your budget,"" Street told BI. ""The ideal sofa will provide a comfortable place to sit as well as add to the overall design of the room.""  For a modern space, choose a leather sofa with clean, square shapes. If you prefer an eclectic look, look for a bright color or fun pattern. Whether it be a wet bar or a wine cabinet, having a little bar area in the living room is convenient for when you have guests over. And it can really add to the design, according to Street. Samantha Orley, an interior designer at Orley Interiors, shared tips on keeping your bar stocked. ""Everyone should have a well-stocked bar with fine scotch, whiskey, vodka, and tequila, along with an assortment of aperitifs, to appeal to any guests' tastes,"" she told BI. The designer also suggested investing in some crystal glassware.  Street told BI that original artwork adds both character and interest to a design. According to Robbie Maynard, interior designer of Robbie Interiors, you can also instantly elevate a space with quality artwork. ""This is a good place to invest,"" Maynard told BI. ""It is very visible and will make a significant statement and set the tone for the room."" ""I love hunting for and investing in unique accent chairs, oftentimes recovering in a custom fabric,"" Orley told BI.  Depending on the room's layout and the style, you may opt for two matching chairs or chairs of different sizes and colors, according to Street.  Area rugs are an important statement piece that set the style and tone for the room, so they're worth spending a little more on, according to Maynard. If statement rugs aren't your thing, Street recommended opting for a basic one that provides a neutral backdrop for other design elements. ""One of my favorite upgrades to make to a living space is to add a built-in sound system,"" Street told BI.  Hidden ceiling speakers are great for parties and don't detract from the room's design.   From custom curtains to electronically controlled blinds, window treatments really help to pull a room together Street told BI you should choose a fabric and design that will complement the other items in the room. If you're looking for one statement piece to splurge on, Orley recommended a coffee table.  ""I usually suggest splurging on something that will give the space a lot of character, like a split bi-level Travertine table or a more contemporary marble table,"" she told BI.  Adequate lighting is a very important element of any room, so it's not something to skimp on. ""When designing a living room, I pay special attention to all the light fixtures, including recessed fixtures and decorative table lamps,"" Maynard told BI.  For frequent fliers or those who just don't have time to take care of real plants, it may be worth it to invest in quality faux plants. ""If you spend the money on good, quality faux plants, you can't tell they are not real and they never need to be watered,"" Maynard told BI.  Books add personality and insight into a person's home. According to Orley, there's nothing more telling than an assortment of coffee-table books from various travels around the world.  ""I like to have a few sets of throw pillows for my living room because this allows me to switch them out and give a different look and feel to the room depending on the season or mood,"" Street told BI.  For winter, you can opt for more fluffy pillows and a cozy throw, and for summer, lighter and brighter fabrics are a great choice. Candles and incense are worth spending a little extra on because they really help to create a warm and welcoming ambiance. ""I encourage clients to find a few scents they love that become their signature,"" Orley said. ""I often travel with incense to bring a little bit of home and coziness to wherever I might be.""

26,Jaures Yip,You're out of luck if you have an older iPhone and want to use Apple Intelligence,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-intelligence-compatibility-iphone-models-mac-ipad-ios-18-2024-6,Is Apple Intelligence enough of a reason to upgrade your iPhone? Apple certainly hopes so.,2024-06-11T15:35:16Z,"Apple finally threw its hat into the AI ring during its WWDC keynote on Monday, revealing a suite of generative AI features it calls Apple Intelligence. But most iPhone users will need to upgrade in order to use them. The Apple Intelligence features for iPhones, iPads, and Macs will be free for users and are set to roll out to US users later this year. There's also a revamped Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence, that promises to be more useful by accessing specific actions within apps. The AI tasks — which include helping draft emails, generating custom images and emojis, and figuring out when you should leave the house to catch your flight — will be mostly handled on the Apple devices themselves, powered by the chips within iPhones, iPads, and Macs. That means you'll need one of the latest iPhones or a fairly modern iPad or Mac to access Apple Intelligence. An entry-level iPhone 15 isn't even enough. You'll need at least the iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple Intelligence is also compatible only with iPads and Macs that have the M1 chip — thankfully, those have been around for years. You'll also be able to let Apple Intelligence and the new Siri tap into ChatGPT for some tasks. The integration is designed to make accessing ChatGPT seamless, but those with older iPhones can always download the ChatGPT iOS app. Apple Intelligence's launch comes after declines in iPhone sales, which dropped by 10% year over year in the first quarter. Data also suggests people are holding on to their iPhones longer. As upgrades plateau and prices increase, people likely see less of a need to trade in their iPhones for the latest models. AI represents an opportunity for Apple to buck that trend. Now iPhone owners will have to decide whether Apple Intelligence is enough of a reason to upgrade. Apple certainly hopes so.

Legal experts had cast doubt on the strength of Musk's claims.,2024-06-11T21:16:47Z,"Elon Musk dropped his lawsuit against OpenAI and two of its cofounders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, on Tuesday, CNBC reported.  The Tesla CEO's lawsuit withdrawal comes one day before a judge was set to consider the future of the case during a hearing in San Francisco on Wednesday. Musk sued the hotshot startup and two of its co-founders in March, accusing Altman and Brockman of betraying OpenAI's initial mission to benefit humanity. In the suit, Musk criticized OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft, saying the AI company had jeopardized its nonprofit mission in favor of maximizing profits for Microsoft. Altman, Brockman, and Musk founded OpenAI in December 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. Musk left the company in 2018. Contract law experts told Business Insider at the time the suit was filed that Musk's case appeared weak, casting doubt on the billionaire's claims of breach of contract given the absence of any written contract between Musk and Altman. OpenAI responded to the suit by calling it ""incoherent"" and ""contradictory,"" suggesting Musk was jealous of the company's success without him. Since suing the company, Musk has continued to stoke the flames of his feud with Altman, frequently slamming OpenAI on X. Lawyers for Altman, OpenAI, and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. This story is breaking. Please check back for updates.

28,Jake Epstein,"US-made Abrams tanks are fighting a dangerous new kind of war, but Ukrainians are building unusual armor to help them survive it",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukrainian-operation-builds-cage-armor-protect-us-made-abrams-tanks-2024-6,Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have outfitted their armored vehicles with steel cages to protect them from the evolving drone threat.,2024-06-11T19:18:36Z,"American-made M1 Abrams tanks were built to fight the Russians, but on the battlefield in Ukraine, they are fighting an unfamiliar kind of war as they go up against Moscow's arsenal of deadly exploding drones — something the Soviets never had and something the Abrams hasn't seen in its other wars. There are concerns the heavy armor on an Abrams may not be enough on its own to protect its crew from this dangerous and evolving threat. However, one Ukrainian company is building steel screens that can offer the tanks an extra layer of protection. ""I think the future of war is the war of drones,"" Oleksandr Myronenko, the operational director of the Metinvest Group, told Business Insider in a recent interview, so it's very important to protect armored vehicles against the rise of unmanned systems. Metinvest is a steel and mining conglomerate that's headquartered in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. For more than a year and a half, the company has been making protective steel screens for Kyiv's aging T-64 and T-72 tanks. Just a few weeks ago, this operation expanded to the Abrams tanks, US-made armor designed and developed during the Cold War to fight the Soviet tank threat. Thirty-one US-provided M1A1 Abrams main battle tanks arrived in Ukraine last fall. By late-April, though, Kyiv had already lost five in combat, at least some to drones. At the start of the conflict in Ukraine, as in past wars, tanks and other armored vehicles primarily had to worry about enemy threats like anti-tank missiles, artillery shells, and mines. But now, on both sides of the war, these vehicles also face small, cheap hobby-style drones packed with explosives that a remote operator can easily fly right into a target and detonate. These things are ubiquitous in Ukraine, and the right hit could permanently damage or destroy a tank — and even kill its crew, trained personnel not easily replaced. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have sought to protect their vehicles by outfitting them with net-like cages as a last-ditch defense against inbound munitions, especially first-person view (FPV) drones that have taken the battlefield by storm. This improvised armor, sometimes described as a ""cope cage,"" vary in appearance and effectiveness. Some look jury-rigged and crudely built, while others are more hardened and structured. Their presence does not render a tank invincible, far from it actually, but they clearly add some extra protection that might keep the crew alive. The increasing employment of cage armor underscores the significant role that drones have played in Ukraine and presents new considerations for modern militaries as they look into better ways to protect their forces from unmanned systems in future conflicts. There are lessons for the US and others. Metinvest began making its protective steel screens for Ukrainian tanks as Russia began using different types of drones on the battlefield, leaving tanks needing added protection against these threats, Myronenko said. When the Abrams eventually arrived, it ran into the same problem as the Soviet tanks, and the military asked Metinvest for help. The Abrams tanks are notably larger than Ukraine's Soviet systems, so it can take up to a week to build a protective screen for the American armor and 12 hours to install. Each of the screens weighs hundreds of pounds and can cost up to $20,000 to make. Though that figure is significantly more expensive than an FPV drone carrying a bomb, which might only be worth a fraction of that, it is much cheaper than losing a tank like the Abrams, which costs upwards of $10 million. That said, Metinvest says the screens are given to the military for free, and so far, the company has produced 25 screens total — seven of which have been for the Abrams. Before the screens are permanently fitted on the tanks, a prototype is made, at an undisclosed location in Ukraine, and tested on the armor to ensure a good fit. Then, it either goes right into production, or improvements are made. In that case, it's sent back to the military for additional testing. On the Abrams, the protective screen wraps around the top and sides of the turret, allowing it to move freely. Some of the other cages spotted during the war are more restrictive — like Russia's infamous ""Turtle Tank"" — and don't allow for such mobility. ""It helps save [the] tank from huge damages"" and greatly increases the survivability of the crew, Myronenko said of the armor. Ukraine's Soviet tanks have already seen their screens tested in battle. Sometimes they may take some damage but can still continue in combat, but other times, the damage is greater, forcing them to pull back. The jury is still out for the Abrams tanks, as they were only recently given the added protection. Myronenko said that his company is patiently waiting to see how they perform. The screens are mainly designed to protect against drones, he said. If an unmanned system hits the screen, it will not necessarily damage the tank. However, artillery shells and larger-caliber weapons are way more threatening and may tear through this shielding. The Abrams isn't the only American armored asset that Metinvest will work with. This month, this operation will begin making protective screens for the US-provided Bradley Fighting Vehicle, which has proven to be a workhorse for Ukrainian front-line forces. Whether these add-on protective screens extend to other armored combat vehicles remains to be seen, but the ever-present threat of exploding drones is growing. ""Anti-drone steel screens help not only to protect expensive equipment from damage by the enemy, but also protect the lives of Ukrainian servicemen,"" Myronenko said in a late-May statement.

We want to hear from you.,2024-06-11T19:10:04Z,"The creator economy is a relatively new investment category built around the rise of social media and the empowerment of individuals as content makers. Like traditional media companies, creator startups often rely on Big Tech platforms like Google and Facebook to make money — a volatile position to hold. Throughout the past year, some startups have lost their way, cut costs, or shut down in full. Meanwhile, other startups are still raising capital and growing. Creator upstarts often operate with fewer costs than older media brands, allowing them to test new business models with limited financial risk. New York media studio Fallen Media, for example, built a business around producing MTV-style shows for the TikTok consumer audience. It keeps production costs low, allowing it to test different shows quickly and determine if they'll perform without over-investing. Creator startups that rely too heavily on influencers as the root of their business can struggle. But companies in this category that use creators to make money in a different industry, like e-commerce or consumer products, are often better positioned to succeed. A new wave of upstarts is building apps that focus on community-building rather than the influencer phenomenon, for example. ""I think of the creator phenomenon as a very kind of broad throughline across a lot of different verticals and sectors,"" Rex Woodbury, founder and managing partner at the VC firm Daybreak, told Business Insider in January. ""The venture-scale generational companies are, yes, creator companies, but they're also typically fitting into another bucket."" BI is compiling our fifth annual list of venture-capital firms funding the creator economy. We want to hear from you on which VC firms are backing the companies that will shape the creator industry's growth in the coming months.

31,Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert,Clarence Thomas raised him 'as a son.' Now he's facing 25-plus years on weapons and drug charges.,https://www.businessinsider.com/clarence-thomas-mark-martin-raised-nephew-son-jailed-2024-5,"Years ago, Thomas took in a 6-year-old relative who reminded him of himself. His sister's grandson, Mark Martin was a ""challenge.""",2024-06-11T19:08:27Z,"The man who was raised by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, Ginni, as their own son from ages 6 to 19 is in jail awaiting trial on drugs and weapons charges, Business Insider has learned. Mark Martin, the grandson of Thomas' sister, Emma Mae Martin, lived with the Thomas family in Virginia from 1997 to 2010, during which time Clarence and Ginni Thomas were his legal guardians. He's a central figure in the furor over undisclosed gifts that Thomas received from a billionaire friend, Harlan Crow. Now 32 years old, Martin told BI in an interview from the Jasper County Detention Center in South Carolina that Clarence and Ginni Thomas washed their hands of him years ago. ""I haven't really heard much from them in a long time,"" Martin said. ""I tried to communicate with them a couple of times, but I've never gotten any response."" In a 2007 C-SPAN interview, Thomas told the host Brian Lamb that Martin, who was 16 at the time, was living with him and his wife and that they were ""raising him as a son."" ""For me, in so many ways, it's rewarding because it's brought me, again, full circle,"" Thomas told Lamb. ""I was about the age my grandfather was when he took my brother and me. And Mark was about the age my brother and I were when he took us in."" The Thomases sent Martin to the elite military prep school Randolph-Macon Academy, as well as a residential therapeutic treatment center called Hidden Lake Academy, which frequently used camping trips and wilderness programs as therapeutic tools. (Hidden Lake Academy became the subject of congressional hearings about facilities for troubled teens over claims they could mislead families and turn abusive.) Crow, a conservative donor and longtime family friend of the Thomases, paid the tuition for both schools, ProPublica reported. None of the payments were recorded at the time as gifts on Thomas' financial disclosures. Crow is an alumnus of Randolph-Macon. This month, in financial disclosures, Thomas acknowledged two vacations Crow had funded in 2019, one to Bali and another to California. ""I guess they looked into Randolph-Macon Academy because Harlan Crow actually graduated from there, so I guess that was behind their decision to send me there — and then apparently he helped finance the HLA trip, too,"" Martin told BI, though he said he wasn't aware at the time that Crow had footed the bills. While the total amount of tuition Crow paid on Martin's behalf remains unclear, fees for all four years at both schools would have exceeded $150,000, ProPublica reported. When neither placement prevented Martin from acting out with minor drug use and other petty crimes, the Thomases cut him off, Martin told BI. Last summer, according to court records reviewed by BI, Martin was arrested on charges of drug trafficking and weapons possession. A warrant reviewed by BI indicates that at the time of his arrest in June 2023, Martin's vehicle was stopped as part of a juvenile-sex-trafficking investigation. He has not been charged with any crimes related to sex trafficking. In separate charges from 2021, Martin was accused of trafficking more than 400 grams of meth and heroin. Those charges are still pending, according to records reviewed by BI. If convicted, Martin faces at least 25 years in prison as part of mandatory-minimum sentencing laws in South Carolina for certain types of drug offenses. He faces at least five additional years for three charges related to the unlawful carrying of a pistol. Due to the nature of the charges against him, which are considered violent crimes in South Carolina, Martin is ineligible for bond, his lawyer told BI. Martin denies the charges against him but has not entered a plea in either case because of a court backlog that has delayed proceedings. Thomas and Crow did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story. While his own father was incarcerated, Martin remembers much of his childhood as the Thomases' ward as relatively privileged. Together, Martin said they traveled to more than 20 countries; he frequently spent summers wakeboarding or waterskiing and babysitting Crow's son when the elite families vacationed together. That all stopped when Martin entered high school, he said, when the Thomases decided they ""just didn't have time to deal with"" him and sent him away to the boarding schools. From his freshman year of high school on, Martin said he rarely saw his Supreme Court-justice great-uncle or his wife, who Martin said had raised him ""like another mother and father"" since childhood. Clarence Thomas was 7 when his mother sent him to be raised by his grandfather in 1955. Thomas lived with his grandfather Myers Anderson, whom Thomas called Daddy, until Anderson kicked him out of the house when Thomas dropped out of his freshman year at Conception Seminary College in 1968. Comparing their experiences, Thomas told C-SPAN Martin was ""more of a challenge than I was."" ""But I think the thing that I'll be able to do is, I'll be able to always look my grandfather in the eye and say that I did for my great-nephew what my grandparents did for us — my brother and me,"" Thomas said. Martin says he was eventually expelled from Randolph-Macon Academy for failing a drug test as a junior in high school. At that point, Martin told BI Clarence and Ginni Thomas shipped him back to Martin's mother's house in Georgia, where they'd taken him from a decade prior, and he'd rarely heard from them since. ""I actually don't know if they know that I'm locked up — I'm not sure they'd care too much,"" Martin told BI. ""I've seen — I've probably seen them two times, maybe three times, over the last 14 years."" Representatives for Randolph-Macon Academy declined to comment for this story, and BI could not independently confirm Martin's claims regarding the reasoning for his expulsion. Martin, now a father of four children himself, said he believed the Thomases were probably disappointed in the direction of his life. He understands why they would be. However, between his father's imprisonment and being taken in by a justice of the Supreme Court at a young age, Martin said he had to ""grow up a lot faster"" than a normal kid would have — and wished his great-aunt and -uncle saw that he could have used their continued support while he was struggling. ""I just wish they'd at least communicate with me — get to know my children,"" Martin said. ""They raised me like another mother and father, so I wanted my children to know who raised me into the person that I became. I want them to be around for that, at least — to see my kids grow up.""

32,Pete Syme,Airlines sometimes turn their planes around and fly thousands of miles home when they have problems. Here's why.,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-airlines-decide-where-to-divert-planes-flights-to-nowhere-2024-6,"British Airways often chooses to send flights back to London where its easier to reroute passengers. American Airlines has an automated tool, HEAT.",2024-06-12T10:35:16Z,"Plane diversions can be a nuisance for passengers and costly for airlines, especially if they end up back where they started in a so-called flight to nowhere. On Monday, a British Airways flight destined for Houston made it across the Atlantic Ocean before turning back over the coast of Newfoundland, resulting in a nine-hour flight to nowhere. An airline spokesperson said the diversion was ""a precaution due to a minor technical issue."" The Boeing 787 returned to London Heathrow, where BA has maintenance facilities. In fact, returning to London is a relatively common practice in such situations for the UK flag carrier: it would be cheaper and easier to rearrange replacement flights for customers as well as repair any issues. For European carriers, a flight to nowhere is likely preferable to the situation involving an Air France jet last month. A burning smell in the cabin prompted an emergency landing in Canada's far north — causing a different flight to be canceled so that plane could rescue the passengers. It took them to New York, where they again had to be re-routed to Seattle, the intended destination. Diversions usually occur due to safety issues. Last month, a United Airlines flight from Switzerland to Chicago turned around over the Atlantic before landing in Ireland, after a passenger's laptop got stuck in their seat. This posed a safety risk due to the potential for a lithium battery fire. Travelers are told to pack electronic devices in their carry-on instead of in the hold so that the crew can notice if it catches fire. If a fire happened over the ocean, there would be nowhere convenient to land. The laptop was removed and the plane took off the following day. The delay in the second flight — more than 24 hours later — was due to the flight crew reaching their maximum time on the clock. Pilots also typically land at the nearest airport in cases of medical issues and unruly passengers, due to the urgency required. However, when it comes to bad weather, it isn't always a clear decision between returning to the original aiport or landing at an alternative airport. Such confusion was seen during a storm in January when a Ryanair flight between Ireland and Scotland landed 540 miles away in Germany. Some carriers have their own automated software that helps in these situations. In 2023, American Airlines launched its tool, the ""Hub Efficiency Analytics Tool,"" or HEAT, to help dispatchers, coordinators, and other employees make decisions. It considers when a crew member exceeds their regulated duty period, which flights have the greatest number of connecting passengers, and how many top-tier loyalty customers are flying. In short, decisions about diversions are made on a case-by-case basis. From bad weather to technical issues, the cost of rerouting passengers is often at the forefront except in an emergency.

33,Charissa Cheong,"I'm a surgeon and my husband's a stay-at-home dad. I knew we couldn't do things the traditional way, but I still have mom guilt.",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-neurosurgeon-mom-demanding-job-parenting-2024-6,"Betsy Grunch works around 60 hours per week as a neurosurgeon. Work-life balance is a challenge, so she made key changes be more present as a parent.",2024-06-12T09:49:49Z,"This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Dr. Betsy Grunch, a neurosurgeon from Georgia, about how she balances her job with being a parent. The following has been edited for length and clarity. As a neurosurgeon, I work an average of 50 to 60 hours a week. I'm also a mom of two: my son is 9, and my daughter is 6. I consider myself a kind, loving, and supportive mom. I'm very hands-on with my kids, but due to the nature and hours of my job, I sometimes miss out on certain events in their lives, like baseball games, which can make me feel like I've let them down. Earlier in my career, I would worry that taking time off would affect my income, so I'd work more than I needed to. I wasn't home as much when my kids were little, and I wasn't as good at balancing my responsibilities. Over the years, I've learned to prioritize my work-life balance and have made specific changes at home and work, accepting that I can't do everything all at once. I met my husband Ray when I was a neurosurgical resident. We got married in my fifth year and moved from North Carolina to Georgia after I completed my residency to start my practice. Our first child was born in 2015. Even before I got pregnant, my husband wasn't working that much and did a lot of the chores at home, so we knew he'd mostly be the one to stay home with the kids. We agreed on this arrangement and decided to hire a nanny while the kids were little. We wouldn't be doing things the traditional way, with the woman staying at home. Ray and I are a team. He does most of the chores except washing dishes and folding laundry, which I take on. We hire people to help with yard work and a cleaner who comes twice a month, but Ray does other household jobs like paying bills and handyman and car stuff. We split childcare responsibilities. I try to get up at 6 a.m. and work out for 30 to 45 minutes. I get the kids up at 7 a.m. and take them to school so I can be at the hospital at 7:30 a.m. Ray picks them up and makes sure they do their homework. He usually takes them to any after-school activities. I try to be home by 5 or 6 p.m., and Ray and I share dinner-making responsibilities and putting the kids to bed. In the evening, we both have some time to ourselves. I usually use this time to reply to emails, do chores, and work on content, as I'm also a content creator. Ray does occasional work as a private investigator, and when he isn't around, we'll have a nanny or my cousin look after the kids. I work one out of every five weekends. We try to spend quality time with our kids and go on family vacations at least a couple of times a year. Neurosurgery is a male-dominated field. I've had colleagues, teachers, and classmates question my ambition and ability to juggle a family and this job. Trying to balance work with life can be challenging, and moms often let themselves feel guilty: If we spend too much time at home, we have work guilt, and if we spend too much time at work, we have mom guilt. My job is very rewarding, but it's also stressful and physically and mentally demanding. I have very ill patients and sometimes have to make high-level decisions. Cases can take 30 minutes or eight hours to manage, and I'm not often sure when I'll be done for the day. It could be 4:30 p.m. or midnight. I try to get home for around 6 p.m., but it's never predictable. If I know there's no way I'll be home for dinner, I'll text Ray to let him know so he can plan to spend the evening with the kids as he desires. When I'm on call for my job, I'm not required to be at the hospital, but I have to be prepared to respond and go there if need be. In that case, Ray would usually be around to look after the kids. I'll receive calls at home and have to open up scans on my computer to make important decisions about a case. I sometimes have to ask my kids to give me five minutes while I put them to bed. Usually, they're understanding. They know mommy takes care of people. But sometimes they get jealous that I'm paying attention to my computer instead of them. Until around two years ago, I consistently got home at 7 or 8 p.m., and my kids would be asleep by then. When I didn't get to see my kids for days on end, I'd feel sad and like I'd disappointed them. I've realized that I want to dedicate time to myself and my family. I wanted to watch my kids grow up. At work, for the most part, you're replaceable, but at home, you are not. Over the past two years, I've learned how to balance my responsibilities much better by getting more help at work and at home. Since 2022, I've hired two additional physician assistants at the clinic. They can see patients, write notes, and refill prescriptions for me. I also hired a social media manager who helps me with my content creation tasks. We don't rely on a nanny much, but we do use her when we go out of town without the kids or go out for dinner together. During the summer, she'll watch them a few times a week to give Ray a break to do other things around the house. It can be hard to ask for help, but once you do, it's mentally liberating. Outsourcing certain responsibilities has been life-changing and helpful. I can spend a lot more time with my kids now. I've learned to prioritize mental health more over the years. This year, I've started taking every fifth Monday off as a personal day to have time for self-care activities like getting a massage or having my hair done. I'm learning to accept that I can't do it all — and I want to continue to strive for growth and balance. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

34,Ned Resnikoff,Forget red and blue: America's real geographic divide is between bosses and their employees,https://www.businessinsider.com/america-power-map-cities-ceo-executives-middle-class-jobs-2024-6,"Executives in New York, call centers in Orlando: American cities are facing a growing power imbalance.",2024-06-12T09:27:02Z,"Housing is a basic need. No matter how expensive it gets, people still need somewhere to live. Given this truism, it's no wonder that the populations of America's so-called superstar cities have stagnated while the Sun Belt's metropolitan areas have boomed. When a city — or, as in the case of California, an entire state — doesn't have enough homes to go around, priced-out residents are forced to relocate to other parts of the country. A lack of building in places like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco has sent home prices and rents soaring, leading to a plateau or even outright decline in the number of people living in these cities. On the flip side, the populations of relatively housing-abundant, lower-cost cities have swelled: Austin has grown by more than 25% over the past decade, while Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Orlando have each grown by more than 20%. On the eve of the pandemic, most of the people emigrating from California were middle-class or lower-income; Texas, Arizona, and Florida are the states that have received the largest influxes of ex-Californians. One 2023 analysis found that New York state continued gaining millionaires even as overall population growth stagnated. Some movement between cities and regions is good. Relocating to a new city can be a great way to raise your income, broaden your cultural horizons, or discover a sense of community and belonging. But America's current seismic reshuffling is something much less benign than a series of freely chosen moves. As the middle class flees superstar cities, those who are able to stick around are likely either too rich to care about housing costs or too poor to take on the expense of relocating somewhere more affordable. For one, this has dramatically reshaped regional job markets. The COVID-era transition to more remote work accelerated this process of ""domestic offshoring,"" a recent study by the workforce-analytics company ADP found. Because there's less of a need for proximity between a firm's leadership and its employees, executives have become more concentrated in high-cost metropolitan areas, while middle-class jobs have shipped off to areas with lower labor costs — areas that, not coincidentally, also tend to have lower housing costs. In the short run, middle-class job growth benefits regional economies in places like Austin, Raleigh, and Charlotte, North Carolina. But in the long run, the high concentration of high-powered individuals in a select few metros is a disaster for social mobility. Domestic offshoring regionally segregates middle- and working-class employees from their employers, making it far more difficult for the former group to advance professionally. This not only creates a dangerous power imbalance between cities but hollows out formerly diverse, vibrant cultural scenes in some of America's biggest cities. As America has sorted into high-cost regions and relatively affordable regions, class itself has become an increasingly regional phenomenon. Regional mobility and social mobility have long gone hand in hand. It wasn't just that the higher-wage starting positions tended to cluster in boomtowns; it was that residing in a boomtown put one in closer contact with all kinds of other opportunities. These might include the chance to network with executives or other employees further up the career ladder; exposure to more-remunerative adjacent professions; or access to investment capital, for those who want to start their own businesses. For example, a relatively green developer from Nashville could move to the Bay Area and be able to rub shoulders with venture capitalists — and eventually entice those venture capitalists to provide the seed money for a new startup. The developer could even move their business back to Nashville, leveraging the connections from their time in California to bring new jobs to Tennessee. This dynamic cultural and economic exchange wouldn't have been possible if the developer had been unable to make the cross-country move. The opportunity loss would be even greater for a customer-service representative who wants to move into a higher-wage, higher-status role as a developer but doesn't have access to a professional network of developers because their employer keeps all those workers in a different metropolitan area. It's not just the individual worker who loses out. When people get locked out of opportunities to raise their incomes or start new businesses, the national economy suffers. An influential 2019 paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti found that low housing supply in superstar cities had significantly constrained US economic growth by limiting ""the number of US workers who have access to the most productive of American cities."" Domestic offshoring threatens to lock in these effects, potentially costing the country trillions of dollars in forgone wealth creation. The superstar cities that ostensibly gain more influence also suffer. A city for managers and executives will never be a city of managers and executives — no matter how many bosses relocate to New York City, they will always be a minority of the population. But if domestic offshoring persists, fewer of the city's other residents will be middle-class professionals; those people will tend to congregate in domestic-offshoring sites. Instead, the superstar cities will become luxury-service economies. Corporate leaders will still create jobs in places like San Francisco and New York, but they will be jobs for the support staffers who sustain the executive lifestyle: food servers, house cleaners, nannies, and so on. These cities, which are already deeply segregated and unequal, will become even more bifurcated between an elite class and a servant class. Beneath the servant class, and overlapping with its lower tiers, will be the large and growing ranks of the truly destitute. Of course, those at the bottom of this class system will suffer the most. But in the long run, this process will make us all poorer, costing us both forgone economic growth and the cultural vitality that can only be found in diverse cities. There is one surefire way to reverse domestic offshoring: build more housing. Companies, the ADP study says, ""have an incentive to locate"" individual and front-line workers ""in places that are more affordable"" and where a lower cost of living translates into less upward pressure on wages. If housing in major cities were more affordable, that incentive would diminish, encouraging firms to spread the distribution of roles equally. Workers could move from one office to another in order to advance their careers or offer more value without worrying about the exorbitant cost of their new home. If the pressures that lead to domestic offshoring are a lose-lose for all the cities involved, then changing course can be a win-win. Even as high-cost cities build more housing and work to reconstruct their middle classes, the growing Sun Belt cities on the other side of domestic offshoring can continue to thrive. They can do this by fostering diversified local economies — with their own local executive class — that are not reliant on any single large employer or industry. Further, they can avoid the mistakes of the larger cities and preemptively build plenty of dense, multifamily, infill housing. This will ease the upward pressure that a growing population puts on housing costs. It will also facilitate future population growth, which can, in turn, support a virtuous cycle of rising productivity, greater economic diversification, and further population increases. The goal should not be to pick winners and losers among cities but to ensure economic integration within cities. Without such integration, the superstar cities face social and political collapse, while workers in domestically offshored jobs face narrower horizons for economic mobility. Society will end up sharing in the cost: If we allow our cities to become divided into imperial metropoles and economic hinterlands, we will all end up poorer. On the other hand, economic integration, and the productivity gains that come along with it, can make us all more prosperous.

Ten missiles hit the 31st Air Defense Division of the Russian Defense Ministry in occupied Crimea, Russian independent Telegram channel Astra reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. The strikes killed one soldier, wounded six, and damaged two S-300 missile systems and four radars, the outlet reported. Prominent Russian blogger Rybar went further, saying Ukraine launched at least 12 ATACMS from the Mykolaiv region, which hit Chernomorsky, Yevpatoria, and Dzhankoy on Monday. Schemes, part of Radio Liberty, shared satellite images of what it said were before and aftermath images of a military facility in the city of Dzhankoy in occupied Crimea on Monday. The images, which the outlet dated April 27, May 20, and June 10, show an air-defense system in the area in May, with fortifications being built later, it said. It said the quality of the satellite images did not allow it to identify the type of equipment that was hit. One image of the aftermath shows a trail of burned land. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine appeared to confirm some of the details in a Facebook post on Monday. It said it launched strikes on a Russian S-400 ""Triumf"" missile system and two S-300 missile systems overnight on Monday. It said none of its missiles were intercepted, but did not specify which type of missiles were used. In a report on Monday, Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine likely used ATACMS in the attack. Business Insider couldn't independently verify details of the attack or the type of missile launched in the strike. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. If true, this would be one of the first ATACMS strikes Ukraine has launched against Crimea since the US secretly sent the country about 100 ATACMS in April. Ukraine has already reportedly used one of the missiles to take out more than 100 Russian soldiers stationed 50 miles from the front line in occupied Luhansk Oblast, showcasing the missile's range and power. Philip Karber, a military analyst with expertise on Ukraine, told Radio Free Europe in April that the weapons ""could basically make Crimea militarily worthless."" On Wednesday, Ukraine said its troops launched another missile strike on Crimea overnight, on an S-300 missile system and two S-400 missile systems. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

36,Melissa Petro,"I'm horrible at job interviews, so I asked an expert for advice before a big opportunity. Her tips helped me land the job.",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-job-bad-job-interviews-2024-6,"Melissa Petro worked for herself for years after developing interview anxiety. When a big job opportunity came up, she turned to an expert for help.",2024-06-12T09:10:01Z,"I've done everything you're not supposed to do during a job interview — appearing unpolished, bad-talking past bosses, and revealing too much. At one job interview in 2011, I even cried. Straight out of college, I felt confident and at ease in front of potential employers. Then, I worked for three years in a very negative and taxing work environment. I started to feel less confident in my abilities and nervous about how I came across in interviews. In 2010, I was a victim of mass media humiliation, and interviewing for my next job was an excruciating experience. In front of potential employers, I froze and fumbled. I decided to become a freelancer, partly to avoid the entire job interview experience. I love working for myself, but I'm always looking for more stability and better-paying clients, so I recently sent my résumé to a publishing-services company. I was invited to interview for a lucrative position as a ghostwriter. It sounded like a dream, but I had never done ghostwriting or worked for a corporate firm. Doubt crept in. I asked Melea Seward, the director of recruiting for The Hired Guns, a talent agency focused on professionals in digital and emerging technology, for advice. ""Of all the human interactions in the world, job interviews are among the most triggering — even for people who don't come to them with a traumatic experience,"" Seward said. Here's the advice she gave me to present myself in the best light. The first question during most interviews is ""Tell me about yourself."" Seward said I should have a strong answer memorized beforehand. ""Don't start with 'I'm a father of two' or why you left your last job,"" she said. Instead, memorize a line that sums up your experience and focuses on what's most applicable to the role. She said to ""keep it short"" — 90 seconds max — and be concrete. People often talk about themselves in generalities. Instead, ""imagine that the first sentence is a headline,"" she said. I may be bad at job interviews, but I'm great at writing headlines. I decided to say, ""I'm a freelance writer and writing instructor who's been providing book editing services since 2010. I've helped hundreds of writers publish personal essays, op-eds, and reported articles worldwide."" People who don't like job interviews may try to avoid thinking about them ahead of time, but Seward said that ""everybody can benefit from prep,"" especially folks like me who freeze or crack under pressure. Once, a guy interviewing me said, ""This is a great job for someone interested in elder care."" I couldn't think of anything to say except, ""Well, that's not me."" ""I don't know anything about incarceration"" is also something I once said at the start of a job interview for an organization with a mission to end mass incarceration. Come with a couple of anecdotes you can adapt to whatever question they ask you, and be prepared to talk about any elephants in the Zoom room. Seward said you should give the necessary context, including the challenges you faced, but more importantly, talk about the steps you took to achieve a positive result in the end. I came fully prepared to explain how my provocative past and ultimately writing a book about it prepared me to help others usher their underheard stories into the light. ""It's not about what happened,"" Seward said, ""it's about what you learned from it."" When you go into any experience thinking it's going to be dreadful, it probably will be, but Seward said that ""when you get legitimately, decidedly, and whole-body curious about anything,"" it would be ""hard to maintain the same level of anxiety."" Instead of focusing on yourself in an interview, Seward advises job candidates to get curious. ""Asking questions is a cortisol reducer for humans,"" she said. It's also a smart way to slow a situation down. Seward said people would often sprint through job interviews. To slow down, she said, ""say to the person interviewing you, 'I might not look at my screen because I'm actually taking notes,' and show your notebook."" When you get hit with a tough question, this tactic becomes a great way to acknowledge that you're paying attention while giving yourself time to respond. I applied the notebook advice at the start of the interview and took deliberate pauses throughout the conversation. I tried to treat the interview as more of a conversation and leaned into my genuine curiosity about the ghostwriting industry. Thanks to Zoom, we can control exactly where the interview will occur. Seward advises creating a situation where you'll feel physically comfortable. Spend time visualizing the experience in advance and imagining it going well. Seward also recommends somatic interventions such as breathing techniques and listening to binaural beats before and after the interview. On the day of my interview, I worked from home instead of trying to Zoom from the café I typically work at. Before the interview began, I sat for five minutes to just breathe and feel my body. I felt at ease and prepared with answers to a couple of predictable questions. I was confident and poised the whole time. Before the interview ended, we talked about the next steps of the hiring process, an obvious indication I'd gotten the job. Even if I hadn't, the experience was the opposite of excruciating. It was fun — something I never thought I'd say about a job interview. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

37,Mikhaila Friel,A group of Swifties missed out on seeing the Eras Tour after a bird flew into their plane,https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-eras-tour-bird-flew-into-plane-edinburgh-2024-6,Kathryn Gallagher told BI she could afford the Eras Tour  by working two jobs. But she missed the show after a bird struck her plane.,2024-06-12T11:37:49Z,"A Taylor Swift fan from Northern Ireland said she and her fellow Swifties were prevented from attending the Eras Tour after a bird flew into their plane. Kathryn Gallagher, 25, planned to fly from her hometown of Antrim, Belfast, to Edinburgh on Sunday for the third and final night of Swift's Scotland shows. Gallagher told Business Insider that she originally planned to attend the show with a friend who lives in the Scottish capital. But she said she had to miss it after her easyJet flight was delayed by around seven hours. ""When I spoke to people in the airport, most people were on that flight to go specifically to the Eras Tour,"" Gallagher said in a video on TikTok. Gallagher said staff explained that safety checks were required to ensure the plane would be able to fly. The Federal Aviation Administration reports that the number of wildlife that are striking aircraft is increasing. In 2023, the agency recorded around 19,400 strikes at 713 US airports. Bird strikes can cause aircraft damage, delays, and cancellations, all of which can cost US airlines around $1.2 billion each year, BI previously reported. Speaking to BI, Gallagher estimated that at least 100 other people waiting to board the flight had also planned to see the concert. (BI could not verify this number). According to Gallagher, the 55-minute easyJet flight was originally due to take off from Belfast at 12:45 p.m., but it didn't leave the airport until 8 p.m. Swift took the stage at around 7:15 p.m., and the show ended just after 10:15 p.m. After waiting for more than six hours, Gallagher gave her ticket away and returned home at 6 p.m. Gallagher said she spent an estimated £400, or around $510, on her round-trip flight, the concert ticket, and outfit: A purple dress embroidered with butterfly pins, inspired by Swift's ""Speak Now"" album. The 25-year-old said she had been able to afford the trip by working two jobs. During the week, Gallagher works full-time as a sales consultant; at the weekend, she works at a bar. ""With the cost of living and stuff at the minute, one salary really isn't enough to enjoy the little luxuries you might've enjoyed a couple of years ago,"" she said. A previous BI report showed that some fans in the US spent up to $20,000 on Eras Tour expenses in 2023. According to a Forbes estimate, the tour grossed around $1.04 billion from the first 60 shows in 2023. Gallagher said easyJet informed her that she wouldn't be eligible for compensation because ""it was out of their control that a bird hit the plane."" ""We are very sorry that flight EZY326 from Belfast to Edinburgh yesterday was delayed,"" an easyJet spokesperson said in a statement to BI on Monday. ""This was due to a bird strike on the aircraft's previous flight which meant the scheduled plane was unable to operate and so we flew an alternative aircraft in from Luton to operate the flight later in the day,"" they said. ""While this was outside of our control, we did all possible to minimise the disruption for customers and provided refreshment vouchers. "" We understand the disappointment this will have caused to customers and we always advise customers to have travel insurance in place to cover unforeseen issues. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is easyJet's highest priority,"" the statement concluded. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

38,Lauren Edmonds,FDA issues warning against 'microdosing' chocolate bars that sent 6 to the hospital,https://www.businessinsider.com/microdosing-chocolate-bar-diamond-shruumz-illness-hospital-2024-6,The FDA and other government agencies are investigating Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing chocolate bars. Eight people have fallen ill so far.,2024-06-09T19:58:39Z,"Eight people in four states fell ill after consuming Diamond Shruumz-brand microdosing chocolate bars, the FDA said on Friday. Microdosing is the practice of regularly taking a dose of a drug — typically a psychedelic — that is small enough not to feel any effect. Some people believe microdosing can improve creativity and mental health. It's become trendy in Silicon Valley. And some CEOs say they've added microdosing to their morning routine. The microdosing industry has boomed in recent years as companies hope to transform drugs like MDMA into approved medicines. Business Insider reported that a ""psychedelics renaissance"" began sweeping the industry in 2020. Data from Pitchbook said psychedelics companies amassed $163.6 million in investments during the first three quarters of 2020. While Diamond Shruumz markets its products as microdoses, they don't actually contain any psychedelics. The company sells more than a dozen products, including chocolate bars that come in six flavors. The company's FAQ said its products use a ""proprietary blend of natural ingredients."" ""There is no presence of psilocybin, amanita, or any scheduled drugs, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience,"" its website says. ""Rest assured, our treats are not only free from psychedelic substances, but our carefully crafted ingredients still offer an experience."" The FDA said people experienced ""severe symptoms"" after eating the chocolate bars, including seizures, central nervous system depression, nausea, vomiting, agitation, abnormal heart rates, and hyper/hypotension. All eight who fell ill sought medical care. Six had to be hospitalized, but there were no reported deaths. ""FDA is working to determine the cause of these illnesses and is considering the appropriate next steps. More information will be provided as it becomes available,"" the news release said. Representatives for Diamond Shruumz did not respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

39,Amanda Goh,"They left NYC for Bali with their teenagers. 7 years later, their sons are fleeing the nest, and they're selling the villa for $1.89 million.",https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-x-couple-builds-family-home-bali-sell-empty-nester-2024-6,"Seven years ago, they sold their teenagers the idea of a yearlong sabbatical in Bali as a break from stressful NYC life and a chance to see the rest of Asia.",2024-06-10T00:14:02Z,"Seven years ago, Gabi Bondor and Zoltan Kaman packed up their lives and moved from New York City to Bali with their two teenage sons in tow. It was an idea sparked by a conversation with a friend over coffee on a cold winter morning. The friend had mentioned his plans to enroll his daughters in the Green School, which is made from eco-friendly bamboo buildings and is known for its sustainability-focused pre-kindergarten through high school curriculum. It's also located in Ubud, over 10,000 miles from New York, near the center of the Indonesian island. ""And while we had traveled to places like India, Vietnam, and China, we'd never been to Indonesia before. So I said, 'Bali, that sounds very warm. Tell me more,'"" Bondor told Business Insider. When they got home, they started researching what life in Bali was like. ""I looked at the school, and it was the opposite of what was happening to my children in high school in New York. When the kids got home that day, I said, 'Guys, we're going to Bali for spring break,'"" Bondor said. The spring break visit came and went, and the couple decided they wanted to experience what it was like to live on the island for longer. They ended up selling their kids the idea of a yearlong sabbatical in Bali as a break from stressful city life and a chance to see the rest of Asia. ""We told them, 'One suitcase each. Everything else goes into storage because we'd be back in a year,'"" Bondor added. ""Although they were allowed to bring their Xbox in their carry-on."" But after their year in Bali passed, the couple realized they didn't want to leave. They made a trip back to the US to clear out their storage and have no plans to move back. The friend who introduced them to Bali didn't make the move in the end, she added. Like many expats, the couple rented a few different homes in Bali before finally building their own house during the pandemic. ""When COVID-19 came, land prices were a lot more affordable than what it is today, so we decided that we were going to purchase a plot somewhere where we could create a space for our family,"" Bondor said. Part of the reason they chose to build instead of buying an off-plan property or continuing to rent was so that they could ensure the quality of the build, Kaman, the cofounder of a digital payment app, told BI. ""We always had some issue or another with the homes — the pump, the AC — and the landlords don't always care,"" Kaman said. ""We thought, 'Why don't we build something ourselves so at least we can control and make sure that everything is working the way we need?'"" Additionally, they had experience renovating their homes during their time in the US. It helped that they also had a great team of builders — recommended by a friend — to rely on too. ""We love the process,"" Bondor said. ""We enjoy it. I think we're a great team. If he is down or pissed, I pick him up, and vice versa."" They knew they wanted to stay near Canggu which is known for its beaches and bustling food scene. ""We lived in the neighborhood and we had always scouted around. Many people like the rice field views, while others like the beach views. We are social people — we like our coffee shops,"" Bondor said. When the couple first saw the plot, located at the end of a narrow street that branches off from the main road, they fell in love immediately. ""It was so quiet and peaceful. There was nothing, except for basically seven big mango trees and thick vegetation. It was like a mini jungle,"" Kaman said. The plot was about 8,200 square feet. Since foreigners aren't allowed to own land in Bali, the piece of land they have is on a 30-year lease. The entire construction process took slightly over a year to complete, and the couple lived in a rented home nearby so they could always be on-site. The biggest challenge they faced was having to work through Bali's rainy season, which typically runs from November to March. ""We started digging a pool when it was the rainy season, and we were just digging mud,"" Bondor said. ""For weeks and weeks, you didn't see the digger come out of the soil — it felt like we weren't getting anywhere."" The couple's six-bedroom home sits in a cul-de-sac, next to a rice field that's been repurposed into a plot to grow cucumbers. The two-story building — which comes with an accessory dwelling unit that the couple calls ""the teenager pad"" — has a red and gray exterior that stands out in contrast to the surrounding greenery. Those who step beyond the gate are greeted by a long walkway flanked by two koi ponds that lead to the main building. ""I like to say that it has a lot of European charm, like Paris with New York dancing a tango kind of thing. I really wanted to incorporate a lot of Balinese elements as well,"" Bondor said. The furniture is handmade in Indonesia, and even the terracotta tiles on the building's exterior were crafted by a local family, she added. Most importantly, it's a house that they designed with their own living habits in mind. ""I think everything, from the kitchen layout to the lighting, is based on the way we live our everyday life,"" Bondor said. But the couple has decided it's time to say goodbye to their house — they're putting the villa on the market for $1.895 million. Their oldest son is already studying abroad, and the youngest will start college soon. The couple plans to downsize to a smaller place. ""He just graduated last weekend. It's really hit us hard that he's leaving very soon and we're going to have this big, empty house to ourselves,"" Kaman said. Moreover, as empty-nesters, they plan to travel a bit more now that they have the freedom to, and a house of this size can't be left empty in tropical weather for too long. ""It's not four seasons, it's always a lot of rain. The sun is always strong. It wears materials out,"" Bondor said. ""We have animals. If one little gecko dies here and nobody cleans for a day or two, the ants will come."" ""This house needs a lot of care and maintenance. So if you're not here for months, this is not going to work,"" Kaman added. However, Bali will always be their home base. The slower pace of life on the island lets them stop and appreciate the little things in their day, like being able to work out in the mornings or have a nice lunch together. That aside, Bali is a melting pot of different cultures, and its people never fail to inspire them. ""There's a very unique expat community that comes to Bali and I think our friends have very similar mindsets that we do,"" Bondor said. The couple has one tip for those who want to build a house in Bali: Don't cut corners. ""Do it the right way, and always respect your team,"" Bondor said.

40,Dominick Reuter,I visited Wayfair's first-ever physical store in Chicago. Take a look.,https://www.businessinsider.com/wayfairs-opens-first-ever-physical-store-take-a-look-2024-6,Housewares retailer Wayfair is getting into brick-and-mortar retail after more than two decades as an e-commerce operation.,2024-06-09T18:36:03Z,"For all of its 22 years in business, housewares retailer Wayfair has been online only. That all changed in May when the company opened its first-ever brick-and-mortar store in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Illinois. The 150,000 square-foot, two-story store features furniture, decor, appliances, and much more. It's not every day that a $7.25 billion e-commerce brand takes the plunge into physical retail, so I decided to visit the store to take a look. The renovation is crisp and inviting, with a main entrance for shoppers and an online order pickup area around back. Like an Ikea, this Wayfair is part showroom, part store, with a selection of items to take home directly, or scan QR codes in-store and have items delivered. I'll be curious to see if these take over on college campuses as the de-facto laundry carrier. The layout flowed very naturally, and I never had trouble getting oriented. I was surprised to see some larger sectionals, since my impression of Wayfair has skewed more toward smaller pieces. Wayfair describes the collection as ""French-country looks designed for real life."" Something about this display felt eerily like an e-commerce site come to life. There was a time when I would have thought that Wayfair exclusively sold accent chairs and carpets. That's certainly not true now. The more I walked around, the more I got the sense that I would need someone to help me process the sheer volume and range of options available. Both games were playable, which will probably keep some kids happy while their parents talk about tile. I could have spent an hour fiddling with different storage options, but alas, time was limited. Wayfair calls this area ""Market Square."" There was stemware for every occasion. Shakers downstairs, bar carts upstairs. I don't think I've ever considered the illuminating qualities of feathers. Like many products in the store, scanning the QR code on an item would bring up a bunch of personalization options. There were a few thoughtfully designed pieces that caught my eye, especially those with integrated storage, like the craft table. I don't know how many styles of mattresses exist, but I'm pretty sure they're all represented in this room. Fancy dog kennels, cat condos, even pet sofas. The scale of home improvement projects just kept ticking up. I saw some peel and stick tile too that would make for an easy kitchen backsplash project. The shower head display reminded me more of a science museum than a home improvement store. Here you could really mess with the different settings. We don't usually think about the sheer variety of something so simple as a doorknob. Do you need the fancy ice or the flatscreen display? So many choices. There really are too many choices to make sometimes. I'm not sure people would believe you if you told them, ""I got this kitchen from Wayfair."" Here's where I'll admit I've never bought anything from Wayfair. Texture and durability are important qualities in choosing housewares, and that can be hard to convey online. The closest thing I can compare it to is Ikea, but I preferred this shopping experience. If Ikea skews more toward urban renters, Wayfair is trying to be the store for suburban homeowners.

41,Alex Bitter,Sam Altman may have just scored a major coup,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-sam-altman-openai-might-biggest-winners-apple-ai-plan-2024-6,"Apple will integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into Siri and other software, bringing it to billions of devices like the iPhone. It's a boon for Sam Altman.",2024-06-11T17:18:54Z,"Forget Tim Cook: OpenAI and Sam Altman might be the biggest winners after Monday's announcements at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. While Apple announced Apple Intelligence, its in-house artificial-intelligence tool, it also said that Apple users will soon be able to use ChatGPT in Siri through an integration it created with OpenAI. The feature is part of Apple's iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and Sequoia, its computer operating system. ChatGPT has grabbed the public's attention since its launch in November 2022. And though it's still much smaller than search giant Google, users have been turning to the chatbot to get answers to questions instead of having to use the right keywords and sift through search results. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said in a WWDC presentation Monday that Apple wants its customers ""to use these external models without having to jump between different tools."" People can currently use ChatGPT on their iPhones, for example, but through its app. With the integration, Siri would be able to draw on ChatGPT to answer questions beyond Apple Intelligence's capabilities, such as requests for recipes that use certain ingredients, the company said in Monday's presentation. Users will have to give Siri permission to share their prompts with ChatGPT beforehand, one of several nods to privacy that Apple made as it rolled out its AI features at WWDC. It's a big endorsement for OpenAI and its CEO Altman, especially since Apple was reportedly considering Google's Gemini earlier this year for its next iPhone release. It also provides ChatGPT with access to a massive new user base. Apple's iOS is installed on about 2.2 billion devices, Wedbush Securities estimated in a note on Monday. And Siri handles 1.5 billion voice requests daily, Kelsey Peterson, Apple's director of machine learning and AI, said at WWDC on Monday. Apple selected OpenAI because ChatGPT provides ""world knowledge"" that Apple customers can draw on, CEO Tim Cook told The Washington Post in an interview published Tuesday. He added that OpenAI's refusal to track users' IP addresses was also a factor that led to the partnership. ""We're integrating with other people as well,"" Cook said, referring to other AI models. ""But they're first, and I think today it's because they're best."" Apple and OpenAI haven't revealed the financial details behind the deal. OpenAI said in a statement that ""the ChatGPT integration, powered by GPT-4o, will come to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS later this year. Users can access it for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT subscribers can connect their accounts and access paid features right from these experiences."" History shows what Apple can do for the companies it partners with. Google's 2005 agreement with Apple to make its search engine the default option on the Safari internet browser, for instance, paid dividends for Google, especially when Apple started selling iPhones that came with Safari a couple of years later. Google's dominance in online search is in part thanks to that pact. Monday's agreement with OpenAI could be the start of something similar. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

Well, sort of. The former president fawned over Taylor Swift in an interview with Variety's Ramin Setoodeh in November. The remarks are set to be published in Setoodeh's forthcoming book about Trump's hit reality television series ""The Apprentice."" Variety published a preview of the book — and Trump's quote — on Monday. ""I think she's beautiful, very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she's liberal. She probably doesn't like Trump. I hear she's very talented,"" Trump said of Swift, per Variety. ""I think she's very beautiful, actually, unusually beautiful!"" he continued. Representatives for Trump and Swift did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours. This isn't the first time Trump has gushed about Swift. In 2012, Trump tweeted about taking a ""beautiful picture"" with Swift. He also sounded elated when Swift was announced as the co-host of that year's Grammy nominations television special. Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5. Taylor is terrific! However, Trump's views of Swift have wavered over the years, particularly when Swift has spoken out against him or the GOP. When Swift voiced her opposition against Tennessee Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn in 2018, Trump expressed his disappointment in the singer. ""I'm sure Taylor Swift doesn't know anything about her and let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25 percent less now, okay?"" Trump told reporters at the time. Swift, for her part, slammed Trump's leadership before publicly endorsing his rival Joe Biden in the 2020 election. I spoke to @vmagazine about why I’ll be voting for Joe Biden for president.

43,Shubhangi Goel,Spotify is planning a more expensive subscription for music nerds,https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-plans-more-expensive-subscription-better-sound-quality-hifi-cost-2024-6,"Users will be charged at least $5 more every month for a plan that allows better audio and new playlist organization tools, Bloomberg reported.",2024-06-12T04:27:54Z,"Spotify is launching a more expensive premium subscription later this year for users who want extra-good sound quality, a person familiar with the plan told Bloomberg. The person said users would be charged at least $5 more every month for a plan that allows better audio and new playlist organization tools. The option is expected to be offered as an upgrade that won't affect existing subscription plans. The person said the new tier's pricing would vary depending on each user's base plan but would average out to about 40% more than the current price. Spotify didn't immediately respond to a request from Business Insider, sent outside standard working hours, to confirm the news. High-fidelity audio, which Spotify first announced in 2021 but has repeatedly delayed, is said to be among the new features. The streamer is competing with Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music, and Block-owned Tidal for the attention of those who prioritize sound quality. All of those platforms are priced similarly to Spotify's current individual plan and already offer high-fidelity, or ""lossless,"" audio. The new tier is also expected to allow users to instantly generate custom playlists for certain activities and times of the year, with Spotify learning the user's preferences and, eventually, creating customized playlists without prompting. The company raised its prices for US subscriptions by up to $3 earlier this month. It was Spotify's second time adjusting prices in a year as it faces competition from other music-streaming platforms. Big Tech is also competing for ears: YouTube is courting podcast listeners, and Amazon's Audible and Spotify are squaring off in audiobooks. But Spotify is faring well among these challenges. It reported record profitability last quarter, and its stock is up 64% this year. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

Siri),"" iPod inventor Tony Fadell said of Apple's new AI strategy.",2024-06-12T07:18:06Z,"Apple may seem to be trailing flashy AI firms like OpenAI, but iPod inventor Tony Fadell thinks the company's slow but steady approach to the technology is the right one. ""Apple is taking baby steps because right now that is all we can count on to deliver successfully,"" Fadell wrote on X on Tuesday. ""This is a solid first effort by Apple focusing on real benefits to users (ex. Siri)."" Fadell was responding to an article by TechCrunch that praised Apple's ""boring and practical"" approach toward AI. The iPhone maker unveiled its new AI offerings on Monday during a keynote presentation at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.  Fadell left Apple back in 2010 but weighed in with his assessment of the AI industry, which he said was being overtaken by investor hype and frenzy. ""Today's AI LLMs are mostly glorified demos for the really interesting applications. They are turning into a commodity because they're overfunded by FOMO-driven VCs who don't truly understand the technology limitations that drive real application requirements,"" he said. In fact, Fadell says the AI craze is highly reminiscent of the rush to fund companies working on self-driving cars over a decade ago. ""It was the NEXT big thing. What do we have 10-12 years later? Think about how many years have past for those efforts to be perfected (and they still aren't yet). We haven't even seen a self-driving car business work yet either,"" he said. ""How many billions were spent on that next big thing before reality set in?! AI is VERY similar,"" he continued. Markets were initially skeptical of Apple's AI work, with the company's shares falling by 2% on Monday after the event. But a positive reception from Wall Street analysts sent the stock soaring 7% on Tuesday.

45,Kwan Wei Kevin Tan,"Elon Musk dropped his Open AI lawsuit, but he isn't done with Sam Altman and the AI race yet",https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-not-done-sam-altman-ai-race-just-yet-2024-6,The mercurial billionaire is still set on dominating the AI space with his $24 billion startup xAI and EV giant Tesla.,2024-06-12T07:10:10Z,"Elon Musk might have withdrawn his lawsuit against OpenAI and its cofounders on Tuesday, but he certainly isn't giving up on winning the AI race just yet. The mercurial billionaire filed a lawsuit against the ChatGPT maker in February, accusing OpenAI of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk cofounded OpenAI with its current CEO, Sam Altman, but left its board in 2018. ""More on this later,"" Musk said of the lawsuit's withdrawal early on Wednesday morning. But the decision to withdraw the case, just a day before a judge was set to consider OpenAI's request to dismiss it, probably isn't a sign of Musk burying the hatchet with Altman. For one, Musk seemed furious when Apple unveiled its widely anticipated partnership with OpenAI on Monday. Shortly after the announcement, Musk threatened to prohibit Apple devices at his companies. ""If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,"" Musk wrote in an X post. ""That is an unacceptable security violation."" And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage This is despite Apple's assurances that ""privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT."" The iPhone maker said in a press release on Tuesday that OpenAI wouldn't be able to track their users' IP addresses or store their requests. Representatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours. Stepping back from all the drama, Musk's goal with the OpenAI lawsuit might have had less to do with winning the case and far more to do with publicly dragging Altman and OpenAI. ""These types of lawsuits can air a lot of dirty laundry, and it can be a major distraction that could impact their day-to-day operations,"" David Hoffman, a contract law expert from the University of Pennsylvania, told BI's Grace Kay in March. And for what it's worth, Musk seems to have spent the interim period repositioning his companies for the AI age. Musk has spent the past few months pitching investors on his vision for EV giant Tesla as an ""AI or robotics company."" Besides teasing a new robotaxi concept, Musk has also hyped the company's Optimus robots as being ""more valuable than everything else combined."" ""If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework, and if you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible,"" Musk said in an earnings call in April. Then, in late May, Musk revealed that his AI startup xAI raised $6 billion for its Series B funding round, giving it a total valuation of $24 billion. This makes Musk's xAI the second-most valuable AI company behind OpenAI, which is valued at around $80 billion. With his chess pieces in place, Musk seems ready to take on OpenAI.

His wife called his death ""a failure of the industry.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/true-crime-producer-threats-overworked-death-failure-industry-2024-6,John Balson's death raises questions about the duty of care that broadcasters and streaming services have toward those working on emotional topics such as true crime.,2024-06-12T13:08:47Z,"The family of a true-crime producer who took his own said he was overworked and had received threats from people connected to a case he was researching. John Balson, 40, based in London, died by suicide on May 17 after doctors told him he was likely dealing with a vestibular migraine disorder, Deadline reported. He died a month after he stopped working as a freelancer due to his condition. A GoFundMe page set up by a friend to help Balson's wife and their three-year-old daughter, said he dealt with ""constant dizziness, migraines, insomnia and pain 24 hours a day, seven days a week."" Balson's wife, Yumeno Niimura, told Deadline that she believes he became ill due to the stress he was under while working on the docuseries ""In the Footsteps of Killers,"" produced by Alaska TV for British broadcaster Channel 4. Niimura said Balson was in ""excruciating pain"" in the lead-up to his death. The show investigated unsolved murder cases in the UK. According to Niimura, Balson was under ""a massive amount of pressure"" while working on the show, and claimed he was blamed for a family declining to take part in the series. In an interview with Us Weekly, Niimura said his death was a ""failure of the industry."" She also told Deadline her husband had received threats from someone related to a person he was researching for ""In the Footsteps of Killers."" Niimura said that smaller TV companies often have smaller budgets and claimed they compensate by forcing ""extra work and unrealistic assignments on freelancers like him."" She said: ""The loss of John Balson is not just his life; it's a failure of the industry. The industry can find a replacement the next day, but there will never be another John Balson."" The working conditions of people involved in film and TV have been in the spotlight recently, with actors and writers going on strike in the US last year. Balson's death raises questions about the duty of care that broadcasters and streaming services have toward employees, particularly those working on emotional topics such as true-crime. In May, Netflix came under scrutiny after a woman named Fiona Harey was harassed and outed by social media users as the alleged stalker in the fictionalized true-crime series ""Baby Reindeer."" The Association of True Crime Producers held an emergency meeting about Balson's death on Tuesday. In a statement on its website published on Tuesday, it said that the people making true-crime shows deal with ""gruesome details, traumatized families and friends and working to tight budgets and deadlines. ""It is right that production companies and broadcasters recognize the additional burdens these place on those making true-crime content."" Channel 4 is conducting an investigation into Balson's death, and a spokesperson for the broadcaster told Business Insider: ""We are in ongoing contact with John's family and offering them our support. Referring to a UK union, the statement continued: ""we are also in a dialogue with BECTU and have engaged an external law firm to undertake a thorough investigation, which will be as swift as circumstances allow. We will take whatever action is appropriate in response to its findings."" A spokesperson for Alaska TV told Business Insider that Balson was ""an extremely talented and thoughtful Director,"" but that they couldn't comment on the circumstances surrounding his death because of Channel 4's ongoing investigation.

Two Israeli security sources confirmed to ABC News that Israeli soldiers posed as refugees from Rafah to carry out the rescue mission on Saturday. According to residents interviewed by the Saudi Arabian-owned Asharq news channel, male and female Israeli soldiers impersonated Palestinian refugees from Rafah to infiltrate the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, per The Times of Israel. They arrived in a white vehicle with mattresses. When questioned by residents, the disguised soldiers who spoke Arabic claimed they were fleeing the IDF's offensive in the south of Gaza, said the Saudi report. They pointed out apartments where hostage Noa Argamani was held which they claimed they had rented, witnesses told Asharq news channel. Three other hostages — Andrey Kozlov, Shlomi Ziv, and Almog Meir Jan — were detained in a building nearby. The Israeli sources who spoke to ABC News confirmed the disguised soldiers used the cover-story that they were looking for a place to live. BBC News spoke to a witness who said the Israelis came in a truck filled with furniture. ""Suddenly, special forces came out of it and started shooting,"" Isaam Jameel Arouqi told BBC News. Eye witnesses told CNN that some Israeli soldiers were also dressed as Hamas fighters. The hostage rescuers included the elite Yamam counter-terrorism unit, and one of its officers was killed in the operation. Yamam, which is part of Israel's Border Police, was supported by the special forces troops of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Intelligence from US sources was also used in the raid, The New York Times reported. The four hostages were among 40 people kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova music festival on October 7, where at least 260 people were massacred. Noa Argamani's abduction went viral when she was taken hostage via motorbike eight months ago. Meanwhile, Hamas-run Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 274 Palestinians in the Nuseirat refugee camp were killed during the operation, AP News reports. The IDF said it launched an air attack when the hostage-rescue mission came under fire from gunmen, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, AP said In January, Israeli soldiers dressed as medics entered a hospital in Jenin on the West Bank and killed three alleged Palestinian militants. The strategy of disguise used in the Gaza rescue raid echoed the Israeli political thriller series ""Fauda."" The hit Netflix show portrayed Arabic-speaking undercover agents impersonating locals to infiltrate West Bank Palestinian militant groups planning attacks on Israelis. The creators of ""Fauda"" are developing a film about the events of October 7. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

48,"Jacob Zinkula,Andy Kiersz","Earning $100,000 a year isn't enough to feel 'rich' in the US anymore",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-you-need-feel-rich-henrys-six-figures-2024-6,"Three HENRYs who made over $100,000 last year share why they don't feel ""rich"" and what's holding them back.",2024-06-12T14:07:19Z,"Madelyn Driver, a 30-year-old who made over $100,000 last year working in the tech industry, said she used to dream about a six-figure income. ""I remember thinking that earning $100,000 felt like an unimaginable milestone,"" she told BI via email. ""Now, my husband and I both exceed that number. Yet, we hardly feel rich."" The couple's recent house-hunting experience is a big reason. While currently based in Pennsylvania, Driver and her husband both work remotely, which allows them to broaden their home search across the US. However, Driver said they've still faced significant affordability challenges. ""We're finding that even in a vast country like the US, housing options that align with our desires for green spaces, a somewhat metropolitan vibe, and cultural vibrancy are surprisingly out of budget,"" she said. In addition to high home prices, elevated mortgage rates have propelled the cost of homeownership to record-high unaffordability levels. Driver is among a group of Americans with six-figure incomes who are struggling to meet some of their financial goals. These people are sometimes called HENRYs — or high earners, not rich yet. In recent years, as the rising costs of housing, food, and childcare have weighed on people's finances, a $100,000-a-year salary hasn't gone as far as it used to. Americans say they'd need to earn $233,000 a year to feel financially secure and $483,000 to feel rich, according to a Bankrate survey conducted in June 2023. For Driver, getting rich isn't only about boosting one's income — it's about reducing one's expenses. ""If expenses — especially housing costs — were more reasonable, I'd feel much more financially secure and rich,"" she said. To be sure, reaching a six-figure income could still be life-changing for many lower-income Americans. And across pay levels, wages have generally been growing faster than inflation in recent months, which could help make some HENRYs feel a bit richer. Business Insider asked Driver and two other HENRYs about their financial challenges — and what changes to their incomes and expenses would be necessary for them to feel rich. BI has verified their earnings. Christopher Stroup, a 33-year-old financial advisor based in Santa Monica, California, made roughly $130,000 last year. However, he said he's still paying off his student debt and working toward his savings goals for a down payment on a home, starting a family, and retirement. That's why he feels far from rich. ""I wouldn't consider myself rich yet because I haven't achieved any of those goals,"" he told BI via email. ""Versus the traditional arc of life, I feel behind financially."" Stroup estimated he'd need an annual income of between $250,000 and $300,000 to feel like his finances were ""rather stable."" This would allow him to make significant progress toward his savings goals and have enough money left over to ""enjoy life,"" he said. To feel ""rich,"" he guessed that he'd need an annual income of about $400,000 to $500,000 a year — more than triple his 2023 earnings. At this income level, he estimated that he'd be able to meet his savings goals, enjoy life, and have some extra money left over. If he can't boost his income to his desired level, Stroup said there's another thing that might help him feel rich: moving to an area with lower housing costs. Business Insider has interviewed several Americans who have moved to different states in recent years in search of lower rents or mortgage payments. ""I rent a 450-square-foot alcove studio in Santa Monica for $1,650 a month,"" Stroup said. ""My sister, who lives in Cincinnati, rents a 1,600-square-foot home with three bedrooms, two-and-a-half bathrooms, and a full backyard for $1,800."" It's not just high-earning Americans who say they feel far from rich. Abid Salahi, a 25-year-old software engineer based in Vancouver, Canada, made over $100,000 last year. However, his journey to a six-figure income came with some downsides, he told BI via email. For example, while going to college helped him become a software engineer, he took out a significant level of student debt. He said he has about $30,000 remaining, and that his debt payments are an extra monthly expense he has to account for during the yearslong repayment process. Salahi said a high income can also come with another challenge: ""lifestyle inflation."" Commonly referred to as ""lifestyle creep,"" this refers to the practice of increasing one's spending as one's income rises — and therefore not increasing one's level of savings much. ""Without proper management, increased spending can absorb the extra income, leaving you with the same amount of savings as if you were earning a lower salary,"" Salahi said. Due to the high costs of housing and other living expenses in his area, Salahi estimated that he'd need to earn about $200,000 to $300,000 to start feeling rich. ""I think feeling truly rich would mean you don't have to look at the prices when you go to a restaurant, grocery store, or travel destination,"" he said. ""You also have a substantial amount of savings and investments that can cover you in cases of emergency."" Are you making over $100,000 a year?

49,Sinéad Baker,Western weapons are getting to Ukraine's front lines. Soldiers say it's not enough yet to tip the balance.,https://www.businessinsider.com/western-aid-reaches-ukraine-frontline-soldiers-outgunned-by-russia-2024-6,"Ukrainian troops in Kharkiv said military supplies had started to reach them after US aid resumed, but that Russia still has a big advantage for now.",2024-06-07T11:03:22Z,"Western military aid is reaching Ukrainian soldiers on the front line, but not at a scale that enables Ukraine to challenge Russia's artillery advantage. Ukrainian troops in Vovchansk, in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, told The Telegraph that ammunition had started to reach their lines after the long US aid hiatus ended, but that they were still being outmatched by Russia. ""If we use 10 shells, they send 50 back,"" one artillery gunner told The Telegraph. ""Even if we receive the shells, our artillery barrels are old and worn out."" Russia started a new offensive in Kharkiv last month, and it has become one of the most intense areas of fighting, particularly because it is close to the border, which allows Russia to easily resupply and launch attacks. The Telegraph's report suggests that the new supplies for Ukraine come from the US, where weaponry supplies to Ukraine have restarted after a six-month hiatus after Republicans stalled further assistance. Ukraine has been receiving military aid from its allies throughout Russia's full-scale invasion, which started in February 2022. But Russia is larger and has more resources, meaning that Ukrainian units have often been at a disadvantage. Western aid has often come in fits and starts, too, as Ukraine's allies debate what and how much to give, leaving soldiers on the front lines struggling with shortages over different periods. While the overall European contribution to Ukraine has been higher than what the US has given, the US has been its single largest donor, and the absence of its support was strongly felt on the battlefield. Ukraine's soldiers said this year, as US support remained stalled, that they had to ration supplies, sometimes being unable to go after targets that they had identified. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in April that Russia had 10 times as many artillery shells as Ukraine. While some new weaponry from the US has already reached Ukrainian soldiers, getting supplies to Ukraine takes time. It's unclear how much aid is expected to reach the soldiers in Kharkiv, or when it would arrive. Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War warned in an update this week that ""Russian forces are attempting to make tactically and operationally significant gains before US military assistance arrives to Ukrainian forces at the frontline at scale."" It concluded that ""the initial arrival of Western-provided weaponry will take some time to have tactical to operational effect on the frontline."" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

50,Jyoti Mann,Silicon Valley is warming up to Donald Trump,https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-donald-trump-fundraiser-presidential-campaign-2024-6,"Two of Silicon Valley's top VCs rallied behind Donald Trump for a fundraiser that raised $12 million, Reuters reported.",2024-06-07T16:19:35Z,"Silicon Valley's billionaire investors are pulling out all the stops to get wealthy donors to empty their pockets for former President Donald Trump.Reuters reported that the tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, along with Sacks' wife, hosted a fundraiser at the Sackses' San Francisco mansion on Thursday night to drum up support for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. A 33-foot inflatable chicken resembling Trump was planned to be involved, CBS News reported. The inflatable even donned a prisoner's uniform, which was a bold reference to Trump being found guilty last week on all counts in his hush-money case.On a recent episode of the ""All-In"" podcast, Sacks said, ""I know there's going to be a lot of people who support Trump, but they don't want to admit it."" The Craft Ventures cofounder said he hoped the fundraiser would help shift the narrative that it might be considered uncool to openly acknowledge being a Trump supporter. Sacks said, ""I think this event is going to break the ice on that, and maybe it will create a preference cascade where, all of a sudden, it becomes acceptable to acknowledge the truth, which is a lot of people support Trump."" He's not the only billionaire in Silicon Valley backing Trump. There appears to be growing support for him. The Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire has also endorsed Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk could also be leaning in that direction as he seems to have been cozying up to Trump recently. The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had discussed taking up an advisory role should the former president reclaim the White House. On Wednesday, Musk posted on X, ""SF Bay Area is shifting towards Trump."" Meanwhile, Palmer Luckey, the founder of the defense-tech firm Anduril, plans to host a June fundraiser for Trump in Newport Beach, a coastal city in Southern California, Bloomberg reported. Donors coughed up $12 million at the Thursday reception and dinner with Trump, Reuters said, citing the Republican National Committee member Harmeet Dhillon and another source. Some tickets were sold for $50,000 each, but a higher-tier ticket costing up to $300,000 was also available, CNBC reported. The ticket came with extras like a photograph with Trump, the report added. The New York Times reported that about 25 people had been expected to attend the dinner, with about another 50 guests planned for the larger reception.

51,Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert,Google's new CFO Anat Ashkenazi raked in a nearly $10 million signing bonus,https://www.businessinsider.com/anat-ashkenazi-cfo-career-google-2024-6,"Alphabet announced Wednesday that Anat Ashkenazi, who worked at Eli Lilly since 2001, will be the company's new CFO.",2024-06-09T00:25:22Z,"Alphabet, Inc. on Wednesday announced the appointment of Anat Ashkenazi as its new Chief Financial Officer, who will oversee Alphabet and Google operations. Upon signing up with the tech giant, the former Eli Lilly executive raked in a $9.9 million signing bonus, The Wall Street Journal reported, in addition to an equity grant worth $13.1 million in the form of restricted stock units, plus her $1 million annual salary — with eligibility for annual bonuses up to 200% of her base salary. Ashkenazi will stay on as senior vice president and CFO at the pharmaceutical company through the end of July before taking on her new role with Google. A search is underway for her successor at Eli Lilly where she worked for over two decades, Business Insider previously reported. According to her biography, Ashkenazi graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she earned her bachelor's degree in finance and economics, and Tel Aviv University, where she earned her MBA. Before joining Eli Lilly in 2001, she worked in financial services at Maalot Standard & Poor's and Bank Hapoalim in Israel. More notably, the last 23 years of her career have been spent in various roles across Eli Lilly — including positions in strategy, finance, and, most recently, as senior vice president, controller, and CFO of Lilly Research Laboratories. As senior vice president, she served as CFO for several of the company's global sectors, including manufacturing and research and development, and oversaw the corporate strategic planning team. ""During her last three years as Lilly's CFO, we have experienced tremendous growth and laid the groundwork to help us reach even more patients with our medicines,"" David A. Ricks, Lilly's chair and CEO, said in a statement regarding Ashkenazi's departure. ""I want to personally thank Anat for her partnership, friendship, and leadership of our financial organization and to wish her well in her new role."" During Ashkenazi's tenure, Eli Lilly has achieved a market cap of over $800 billion, largely thanks to two of the company's newer products — Mounjaro and Zepbound, popular antidiabetic medications for weight loss and treating type 2 diabetes. Her transition to Google comes as the tech giant invests heavily in artificial intelligence. Alphabet's stock hit its all-time high on May 21 at $179.54 per share. ""This was a strong candidate that fills a void for Alphabet at a key time in its growth transformation and AI Revolution,"" Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, told Business Insider: ""She has a strong reputation and great CFO experience. Right hire at the right time."" In her new role at Google, Ashkenazi will succeed Ruth Porat, who served as CFO before she was named chief investment officer last year. Representatives for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

52,Alcynna Lloyd,"I'm a single mom who rents my backyard to dog owners. I earned $3,000 in 11 months to help me pay bills.",https://www.businessinsider.com/single-mom-made-money-side-hustle-backyard-sniffspot-dog-park-2024-6,A teacher turned her yard into a private dog park through Sniffspot. She uses the earnings from her side hustle to pay bills and cover expenses.,2024-06-09T09:17:02Z,"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Emily Piehl, a 54-year-old elementary school STEM teacher from Antioch, Illinois, who started renting out her backyard on Sniffspot in 2023. The essay has been edited for length and clarity. I'm a single mom living in Antioch, Illinois — between Milwaukee and Chicago — with two teenagers and a hound. I've been teaching for a long time and earn a decent amount of money, but the cost of living has increased. In the past, I've had some trouble paying bills. I don't have a spouse or a roommate, so I don't have other income coming in — it's just me and my kids. A little less than a year ago, I saw an ad on Facebook about hosting on Sniffspot. It's an app that helps homeowners in renting out their yards as private dog parks. It's a good option for dog owners with reactive pets or those who are uncomfortable with traditional dog parks. After finding out more information about Sniffspot, I decided to clean up my backyard and give it a try. I have a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house. It has a large fenced backyard that's about a quarter of an acre. There aren't a lot of trees, making it a great spot for dogs to run around and have fun. Since starting to rent out my yard last July, I've earned $3,000 so far. While it's not a large amount of money, it covers nearly two mortgage payments. Additionally, it has allowed me to purchase new tires for my vehicle, handle bills, and recently, fund a two-night hotel stay for my kids and me to travel to Pennsylvania to visit my sick dad. Before Sniffspot, these extra expenses would have really impacted my monthly budget. Preparing my yard to host wasn't difficult. I didn't have to do any major tree trimming, just some cleaning up. I added a patio umbrella, relocated a table to a specific area, placed cushions for chairs, and bought some dog toys. I probably spent around $200 — I didn't put a lot of money into it. There aren't many Sniffspots in my area, but I have visitors often, even during the winter months. Sniffspot allows hosts to set their price, though they offer a recommended price. To determine my rate, I looked at similar Sniffspots within a 10- to0 15-mile radius. I settled on $10 per hour. The company has a policy where, if guests bring additional dogs, they receive a 50% discount. A lot of my guests have two dogs, so if they come for an hour, they're charged $15. Sinffspot takes out their fees, so I typically earn around $11.12. I could charge more, but I don't want to charge too much and not have people come. When I started, the first visitors I had were two women I know, and my neighbor across the street. Now, I have around six to eight regular visitors. Two of them have memberships and visit frequently, with one even coming twice a day or at least every day. Then there are others who come every once in a while. Recently, I've been getting a lot more returning guests. The people who use my property are mainly in their 20s and 30s. While I've never asked them directly, I imagine many of them live in areas without fenced yards. I typically don't have any direct contact with guests. They just schedule through the app and notify me of their arrival. I provide information on accessing the yard through the side gate, and then they have the space to themselves. If they have any questions, they can message me through the app, which makes everything convenient. I've never felt uncomfortable with people in my yard. They've always been respectful of the property and clean up after themselves. I haven't encountered any problems so far. I had a guy visit a few times who had recently adopted a new puppy from a local rescue. He was working with a dog trainer because his dog would bark and lunge at people while walking. The trainer suggested trying out a private dog park. He mentioned that the first time his dog was off the leash in my yard, it was his first time ever. It made me so happy. It's nice to peek out of my kitchen window and see all of the dogs running around and having fun. I am a single parent, and I don't have family in the area. For a long time, I've been trying to find ways to make extra money without having to do a lot of extra work. (I even considered driving for UberEats for a while.) While there are other methods to make money, like renting out rooms in your homes, I prefer not to do so while my kids are at home. Being on Sniffspot helps me have a little comfort. When I first started, my 17-year-old son told me, ""That's passive income, mom."" He's right. Hopefully, more and more people will learn about Sniffspot.

53,Dominick Reuter,The Walmart heirs have added more than $53 billion to their combined net worth this year — second only to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang,https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-heirs-combined-net-worth-up-53-billion-this-year-2024-6,The heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton have seen their wealth balloon as the company's stock price reaches all-time highs.,2024-06-07T16:13:11Z,"It's no secret that Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang has had an explosive year so far when it comes to his personal net worth. Huang has more than doubled his fortune since January, adding more than $62 billion as the chipmaker's stock is up 40% year-to-date. And while Mark Zuckerberg saw the second-highest growth in individual wealth in 2024, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, the combined gains seen by the Walmart heirs outpaced the Meta CEO. As of Thursday, Walmart founder Sam Walton's three children and grandson have added a combined $53.7 billion to their wealth this year as Walmart's stock rallied to record highs. The family controls about 45% of Walmart's shares. While Rob, Alice, and Jim Walton are worth roughly $87 billion apiece, the younger Lukas is worth $31.1 billion, putting their family's fortune at more than $293 billion — far above the individual wealth of Bernard Arnault, Jeff Bezos, or Elon Musk. Rob Walton, the eldest son, first joined Walmart with his father in 1969 and retired this week after more than 40 years on the company's board of directors. 37-year-old Lukas Walton, whose father John Walton died in 2005, is the wealthiest person in Illinois and spends much of his time and money working on environmental issues.

54,Kali Hays,"X is pushing advertisers to use Grok, the sarcastic, not 'woke' AI bot. They're not interested.",https://www.businessinsider.com/x-wants-advertisers-to-use-grok-they-are-not-interested-2024-6,"""What advertiser or brand would want Grok writing for them?""",2024-06-07T16:47:14Z,"X employees have been pushing advertisers to use the platform's AI chatbot Grok. Grok is being compared to OpenAI's ChatGPT or even Meta's new AI ad tools that can write digital copy and create imagery for online ad campaigns, according to two people in advertising who have heard X pitches and a video from X for advertisers seen by Business Insider. Grok, part of Xai, cannot create imagery, and one of the advertising sources described its ability to answer prompts and create ad copy as, ""basic"" and ultimately unhelpful for experienced social or brand managers. Grok's responses are limited to writing text for X posts that can be run as ads on the platform. While many advertisers are not opposed to using AI in their work, one big issue with Grok is that the chatbot was trained explicitly to be ""sarcastic"" and flippant in tone, and even to curse in its responses to user queries. When it launched late last year, Elon Musk said Grok was ""based & loves sarcasm"" and designed to be the antithesis of what he refers to as ""woke,"" which is typically used by political conservatives to describe social justice and inclusion efforts. Both sources noted that the typical brand looking to place ads on a digital platform like X does not want copy that is crude, sardonic, or intentionally ignorant of modern social mores. ""What advertiser or brand would want Grok writing for them?"" one asked. The other referred to X employees pushing Grok as a ""desperate"" move by a company that no longer has broad appeal for brands. ""I can say this honestly: X isn't even mentioned as an option for a single one of our clients,"" one of the people said. ""It was never a first choice, but it used to be always mentioned."" Grok has two modes, ""fun"" and ""regular,"" with the latter set to respond in a more straightforward manner. In a video presentation seen by BI, an example is shown of Grok responding to a prompt asking for X posts for a flower shop in New York City. Its first suggestion for ad text starts with ""Spring has sprung in NYC!"" A representative of X did not respond to an email seeking comment. Musk acquired the platform as Twitter in late 2022 and has since struggled to keep users and advertisers, through which Twitter made the vast majority of its revenue. That year, although Musk took Twitter by surprise by first attempting a hostile takeover and then agreeing to acquire the platform for $44 billion, then fighting for months to get out of the deal, the platform made roughly $4 billion in ad revenue. That number fell in 2023 by about half, according to Bloomberg. Linda Yaccarino arrived as CEO a year ago to run advertising, while Musk continued to run almost everything else at X. The launch of things like live video and an appeal to more right-wing conservative influencers and personalities has not done much to appeal to advertisers. After Disney and other major brands stopped advertising on the platform, given a continual rise in hate speech on the platform and Musk's own support and bolstering of racist propaganda and conspiracy theories, Musk, at a conference, publicly told advertisers to ""go fuck yourself"" for leaving X. Now, X is trying to appeal to small and medium-sized businesses to advertise on the platform as large advertisers, previously the bulk of Twitter's business, have yet to return. Meta has dominated this segment of the ad marketplace where most businesses of this size choose to spend their ad budgets. Digital ad spend has been climbing since last year, and companies like Meta and Google have seen their digital ads-based businesses soar again. X is currently offering all advertisers a $200 discount on any ad buy. Are you a tech employee or someone with a tip or insight to share?

55,Veronica Thatcher,I've worked at Costco for 18 years. Here are 10 of the best things I'm seeing on the shelves this month.,https://www.businessinsider.com/best-things-at-costco-this-month-employee-reveals-2024-6,"The Kirkland Signature s'mores cookies and Titan backpack coolers are some of the best things to get at Costco this month, an employee says.",2024-06-07T17:08:02Z,"Like many fans of Costco, the leading retailer in customer satisfaction, I love browsing the shelves to see which items are worth taking home. The store has a great rotating inventory and competitive pricing, so it's no wonder why so many shoppers love the retailer. I've worked at Costco for over 18 years, so I'm always searching for the best-value items at the warehouse. Here are 10 things I recommend checking out at Costco in June. Prices may vary by location. The Meat District chuck-and-brisket patties are perfect for easy grilling because they allow you to make burgers with less prep time and no mess. According to their packaging, the patties are made from premium steak cuts and seasoned with a garlic-peppercorn rub. Each package, which contains eight burger patties, can be found in the cooler boxes at Costco's deli. At my Costco, a package costs $17. As summer approaches, these Titan 26-can backpack coolers with ice-wall pockets have been selling quickly at my location. The backpack features leak-proof lining and adjustable, padded straps. They also come with two ice packs ready to be frozen, making them a great bag for outdoor use or even lunch storage. Each backpack is $45 at my location. If you're looking for summer fun, check out the Zuru Bunch O Balloons tropical party pack, which features 490 self-tying balloons.  The stems on these balloons make filling them super simple — just attach a stem to a hose, fill it with water, and shake to make as many as 100 balloons in less than a minute. My Costco sells packages of the Zuru Bunch O Balloons, which are seasonal, for $25. The Kirkland Signature beef-and-pork meatballs with pasta and sauce is the newest premade item in Costco's deli, and it's delicious. Each container comes with rigatoni pasta, marinara sauce, and six giant meatballs, all topped with Parmesan cheese. This meal is so easy to prepare. Everything is measured out, so all you have to do is set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, cover the tray with foil, place it on a cookie sheet, and bake it for 50 minutes.  The tray can feed about four people and costs $4.50 per pound, which comes out to about $20 per container. CHI is most popular for its hair products, but the brand also carries an electronic iron with a retractable cord. The iron features 400 steam holes and electronic temperature control. The CHI iron costs $70 at my Costco. Costco's bakery has been producing delicious seasonal items, including the Kirkland Signature s'mores cookies. The cookies are made with semisweet chocolate, graham flour, and marshmallows for a gooey first bite. I find the best way to eat them is to microwave them for 10 seconds before taking a bite. Each package contains 24 cookies and costs $10. Costco is now carrying character-embroidered beach towels for the family. The towels come with four character designs: Hello Kitty, Stitch, Bluey, and Spider-Man. These beach towels are 63-by-34 inches and machine washable. The sheared-velour towels are $18 at my store. If you want to tidy up a space, the iDesign cosmetic organizer three-piece set could come in handy. The organizer is great to keep in a bedroom or even the bathroom. The set contains two three-drawer organizers and a carousel organizer with a removable tray. These organizers aren't dishwasher safe, but cleaning is as easy as getting a damp cloth and wiping them down. The iDesign cosmetic organizers are $39 at my store. The SkinnyDipped dark-chocolate peanut-butter cups are a tasty sweet treat. Each confection is coated with dark chocolate and loaded with peanut butter. I like that this sweet treat has only 2 grams of sugar and less than 100 calories per serving. My Costco sells a 30-count bag for $14.60. The Seville Classics two-tier drawer sets are perfect for under-the-sink, bathroom, and cabinet storage and allow easy access to your items. The drawer set also features nonslip feet and a metal frame. These drawers are $34 at my Costco.

56,Katie Notopoulos,"Oh, so now I can't shoot fireworks at a Lambo from a helicopter?",https://www.businessinsider.com/alex-choi-youtube-lamborghini-fireworks-helicopter-freedom-2024-6,"We used to be a country founded on freedom! But I guess that doesn't extend to some YouTube stunts, as Alex Choi has found out.",2024-06-07T18:51:05Z,"We used to be a country that was founded on the immutable principles of freedom of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Now, you can't even shoot fireworks at a Lamborghini from a helicopter for a YouTube video without the nanny state getting involved! Federal authorities arrested the YouTuber Alex Choi on Thursday on charges stemming from a Fourth of July video he posted last summer. In the video, two women shoot fireworks from a helicopter at a blue Lamborghini set to Miley Cyrus' song ""Party in the USA."" Choi, a car influencer with 1 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, typically posts videos of various stunts with sports cars, like using his Lamborghini to tow other cars or filming passenger reactions as he rapidly accelerates while driving on streets. The video ""Destroying a Lamborghini With Fireworks,"" which contained a paid promotion, has been removed from YouTube (a mirror of it exists on Instagram). A criminal complaint filed by the US attorney's office in California's Central District says that Choi violated the law during the filming of the video. He faces one count of causing the placement of an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft. He also filmed on Bureau of Land Management land without a permit or insurance and used fireworks on BLM land, the charging documents say. The charging papers also say the Federal Aviation Administration investigated the video, which was filmed in the El Mirage Dry Lake Bed in San Bernadino, California. The agency revoked the helicopter pilot's license in December. The Associated Press reported that Choi appeared in court Thursday and was released on a $50,000 bond. He's set to be arraigned on July 2. This isn't the first time a YouTuber has gotten in trouble for a stunt. In 2021, a YouTuber intentionally crashed a plane in California for a video and had to serve six months of jail time for the stunt. A few weeks ago, the city of Seattle fined an Instagrammer $83,621 over penalties for reckless driving of a modified car he called the ""Belltown Hellcat."" Choi did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his management agency. Now, sure, the stunt was wildly dangerous, and not just to the Lamborghini driver — recklessly setting off illegal fireworks in California comes with a risk of wildfire. (In case it's not clear, we're speaking in jest. Seriously: Don't do this.) But the spirit and creativity of this stunt? Our Founding Fathers would be proud.

57,Geoff Weiss,"Beyoncé tickets and $2,000 photo albums: Supreme Court justices reveal the gifts they got",https://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-court-justices-got-gifted-beyonce-tickets-photo-albums-2024-6,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson got four tickets to Beyoncé's ""Renaissance World Tour"" worth over $3,700, she reported.",2024-06-07T17:31:10Z,"New financial disclosures for eight Supreme Court Justices reveal the outside income and gifts they received in 2023 — and made reference to the gift scandal that has plagued conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. Stricter ethics rules adopted in March 2023 require Supreme Court Justices to disclose more gifts, trips, and meals they may have accepted. Among the gifts and income disclosed from last year, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she got concert tickets from Beyoncé Knowles-Carter to the ""Renaissance World Tour,"" with the four passes worth over $3,700. Brown Jackson also reported $12,500 in gifted artwork for the justice's chambers. The disclosures revealed other ways Justices are making money — including a hefty book deal advance for Brown Jackson from Penguin Random House worth nearly $900,000. Justice Brett Kavanaugh also reported $340,000 in book royalty income, while Justice Neil Gorsuch reported $250,000 in royalty income from HarperCollins. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pocketed nearly $2,000 for voicing a character in an animated TV show. And while most of the Justices disclosed their investments in the stock market, Kavanaugh's report for 2023 showed none. However, the most noteworthy gift on the disclosures wasn't one from last year.  In his 2023 disclosure, Justice Thomas amended his disclosures from 2019 to include luxury trips he received from billionaire Harlan Crow. Thomas has been under fire in the past for accepting lavish vacations and gifts from the GOP megadonor; his report for 2023 now include references to two trips hosted by Crow in 2019 to Bali and Monte Rio, California. Thomas has denied any conflict of interest, and Harlan Crow has said that the arch-conservative justice is simply a friend.  Thomas' last disclosure, made public in August 2023, mentioned Crow throughout, including flights, meals, and lodging he paid for on various trips. Thomas' report this year also revealed he received two photo albums worth $2,000 from Terrence Giroux — the executive director of the Horatio Alger Association — and his wife, Barbara. Alito is the only Justice for whom the Supreme Court did not publish a report today. He was granted a 90-day extension to file, according to the New York Times. Alito is under his own scrutiny for flags displaying pro-Trump symbols that flew at his properties around the time of the January 6 riot in 2021. Alito has said his wife was responsible for putting the flags up and blamed a dispute with neighbors, though reports indicate the timeline doesn't add up.

58,Ana Altchek,Tesla's $450 lightning-shaped bottle of mezcal is its most expensive liquor yet,https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-mezcal-bottle-for-sale-2024-6,"Tesla's latest liquor offering isn't cheap. After taxes, Tesla Mezcal comes out to about $498.",2024-06-07T17:29:38Z,"Tesla announced its most expensive alcohol yet on Thursday: a $450 lightning-shaped bottle of mezcal. Tesla director of product design Javier Verdura designed the hand-blown glass bottle, which has a sleek, black finish and draws inspiration from centuries-old pottery traditions in Oaxaca, Mexico, Tesla said on its website. The liquor has a citrusy scent with notes of lime and green apple, and a smoky finish, according to the listing. It also has some sweeter flavors with finishes of tuberose, jasmine, and chamomile, the website says. Believe it or not, this is the third limited-release alcohol product that the carmaker has produced — and they've all been pricey. Last year, Tesla sold a set of two 11-ounce Cyberbeers with two ceramic Cybersteins for $150. The set was designed to mimic the look of a Cybertruck, which had yet to be released at the time. Earlier in 2023, the EV giant launched a limited edition ""GigaBier,"" to celebrate the opening of Tesla's Gigafactory in Berlin. The Pilsner-style lager cost about $98 for a pack of three.The EV-maker also released a $250 gold bottle of Tesla Tequila in a lightning-bolt shaped bottle, similarly designed to the latest model. The 750ml bottle came out in 2020, two years after Musk joked about ""Teslaquilla"" in a tweet. Tesla Tequila sold out within hours and Tesla released a second batch in March 2021, which also sold out almost immediately. After it sold out, resellers listed empty bottles of the Tesla Tequila for thousands of dollars online. Tesla Mezcal comes to about $498 after taxes and each customer is limited to two sets. Tesla didn't respond to BI about how many Mezcals have been sold so far. But if sales are similar to its other drinks, it'll probably go quickly. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

59,Jala Eaton,Median household wealth for Black Americans is projected to hit $0 by 2053. My estate plan is designed to protect me from that.,https://www.businessinsider.com/estate-plan-designed-make-sure-wealth-build-lasts-2024-6,An estate-planning attorney shares details behind the process and where some people's plans might fall short.,2024-06-07T17:34:13Z,"Estate planning is a fancy way of saying you're planning for the future — a time when you'll be unable to manage your health and wealth. Many people focus on financial planning, but not as many think about the broader picture. However, the process doesn't need to be complicated — it's a matter of creating legal documents appointing people to speak and act for you. I'm an estate-planning attorney, and I've seen how important this process is and where some people's plans fall short. I want to continue helping others after I'm physically unable to do so. A 2017 study by the Institute for Policy Studies looking at long-term projections for the racial wealth gap found that median Black household wealth could reach zero by 2053. That means my long-term goals need to factor into my estate plan to secure generational wealth. I want to thrive today and help my future beneficiaries avoid conflicts, excessive taxes, financial burdens, and disputes that could cost time and money. I considered several questions about my estate when deciding on my financial goals: My estate plan consists of a financial power of attorney, an advance directive, a guardian nomination, a will, and a trust. As an estate-planning attorney, I frequently encounter families who created a trust but didn't understand how it works and don't have a plan for its upkeep. My estate plan is designed to support all the assets I leave behind and ensure the financial moves I'm making now stay on track. For example, if I buy a house, I have to make sure there's a plan so my trust (and the trustees I leave in charge) can continue paying for the house. I'm accounting for a mortgage, maintenance and remodeling costs, and property taxes. In one case I saw property taxes go from $3,000 to $11,000 a year following a property transfer. If your estate plan is set up correctly, some debts cannot be collected after death. I've chosen to save, invest, and pay down debts to minimize the bills my estate and trust would be responsible for. Considering my estate plan early in life will help me figure out which debts I should pay off first. When it comes to my plans, the most important part is educating the people around me about my moves and my wishes. It's easy for your plan to fail when the people you leave in charge don't know what to do or how to do it. Having financial conversations and being transparent is the best way to ensure my financial and estate plans remain on track. My goal is to create a comprehensive financial road map that will address my current needs and future aspirations. I've thought about my financial stability at every stage of life. I've found it helps to think about your long-term goals and values first. Then you can ask yourself the big questions — the who, what, why, and how — and get the ball rolling.  "

61,Cameron Manley,Ukraine war video appears to show US-supplied Bradley fighting vehicle and Russian APC in a head-on firefight,https://www.businessinsider.com/us-made-bradley-destroys-russian-carrier-point-blank-range-video-2024-6,A new war video released by Ukraine appears to show a US-supplied M2 Bradley attacking a Russian personnel carrier at close range in Donetsk.,2024-06-08T16:09:01Z,"A new war video released by Ukraine appears to show a US-supplied M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle shooting at a Russian armored personnel carrier at point-blank range. The two vehicles race toward each other at high speed on a country road and launch continuous fire. At one moment, they come within a few feet of one another, narrowly avoiding a collision. Soldiers are seen falling from the Russian armored car before it swerves off the road and appears to come to a stop, smoke billowing from its rear. A caption accompanying the video reads: ""The soldiers of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade are holding back at least three Russian combat brigades. With huge manpower reserves, the Muscovites are quickly replenishing their heavy losses and throwing them back into battle. The fighting does not stop for a moment."" The Ukrainian military website Militarnyi reports that the Russian vehicle was a BTR-82A, built with a 30mm machine gun. Business Insider could not independently verify where or when the video was taken. DeepState, a Telegram analytics channel that tracks battlefield events, said the video was taken on the eastern outskirts of the village of Sokil in Ukraine's Donetsk oblast, not far from Chasiv Yar. The channel stated that, according to the brigade's spokesperson, the Russian APC ""subsequently exploded on mines laid by Ukraine's Defence Forces."" This is the second video in as many weeks in which Ukraine's 47th Mechanized Bridge has demonstrated what Bradley's Bushmaster M242 25mm automatic cannon can do in close combat. The first, published on June 2, appeared to show a Bradley firing at two Russian personnel carriers. Russian soldiers can be seen dismounting and fleeing the vehicles. Ein Bradley der 47. Mech.

The Bradley IFV is an armored vehicle used for transporting troops and providing fire support. It is also sometimes used for reconnaissance missions. The Bradley is quick and highly maneuverable. It is operated by a three-person crew consisting of a driver, the commander, and a gunner and can carry up to half a dozen fully equipped soldiers. Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen.

62,Cameron Manley,Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund to vote against Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package,https://www.businessinsider.com/norways-wealth-fund-vote-against-elon-musks-55bn-tesla-paycheck-2024-6,"Norway's sovereign wealth fund will vote against Elon Musk's $56 billion paycheck at Tesla's annual meeting, citing concerns over award size, performance triggers, and key person risk.",2024-06-09T16:53:32Z,"Norway's sovereign wealth fund, operated by Norges Bank Investment Management, has said it will vote against Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package at Tesla's annual meeting on Thursday. In a statement, Norges Bank Investment Management said, ""While we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk's leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk."" Norway's sovereign wealth fund is valued at $1.7 trillion and is the eighth largest Tesla shareholder, per Reuters. Robyn Denholm, chairperson of the Tesla Board of Directors, wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier this week, calling for ""reciprocal respect."" Musk has no ""shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world,"" she wrote. Nicolai Tangen, the the Norwegian wealth fund's chief executive, told the Financial Times in 2022: ""We are seeing corporate greed reaching a level that we haven't seen before and it's really becoming very costly for shareholders in terms of dilution."" Tesla shareholders will vote on Musk's pay package on Thursday. Investors approved Musk's pay deal in 2018, but a judge in Delaware struck down the sum in January, calling it ""an unfathomable sum"" and forcing the board to reapprove it. Last month, two large proxy advisor firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. Referring to Musk's fortune, Denholm said: ""This is obviously not about the money. We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018."" Musk is the third richest person in the world, worth $203 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Although Tesla delivered record sales of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, the EV maker has faced increased scrutiny in recent months. According to emails obtained by CNBC earlier this week, Musk has been diverting important resources to his other businesses: social media platform X and his AI startup xAI. Earlier this year, investors accused Musk of ""blackmailing"" them by tweeting that he was ""uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having 25 percent voting control."" In April, Musk sacked Tesla's entire Supercharger team, including senior director of EV charging Rebecca Tinucci, a move that was criticized by Tesla's investors and partners.

63,Benjamin Zhang,"I drove Hyundai's $52,000 Palisade SUV. These were my 24 favorite features",https://www.businessinsider.com/hyundai-palisade-suv-review-my-favorite-cool-features-safety-tech-2024-6,"I recently reviewed a fully-loaded 2024 Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy SUV. I was blown away by its premium cabin, smooth engine, and advanced tech.",2024-06-09T10:58:01Z,"The Hyundai Palisade is one of the most popular and critically acclaimed three-row family SUVs on sale today. The Palisade launched back in 2019 alongside its corporate sister, the Kia Telluride, and received an update in 2023 with fresh tech and styling to help it remain competitive. I recently reviewed a $52,000 2024 Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy AWD. It proved to be one of the most impressive SUVs of its type I'd ever driven. I was blown away by the Palisade Calligraphy's premium cabin, smooth engine, and advanced tech. Here's a closer look at some of my favorite features. The most obvious part of the Palisade's 2023 update is a futuristic front facia. This new grille work brings the flagship Palisade in line with Hyundai's new corporate aesthetic that debuted with the compact Tucson SUV's parametric jewel pattern grille. Instead of chrome, the XRT and Calligraphy Night trims have their grilles blacked out. The Palisade's headlights are on either side of the front grille. The LED daytime running lights are located on the outside of the round headlights. When not activated, the turn signals blend in as part of the chrome grille. The only engine available on the Palisade is Hyundai's 3.8-liter, naturally aspirated Lambda II V6 engine. The V6 produces 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. It's paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The quiet, smooth-revving V6 delivers effortless power, sufficient acceleration, and competitive fuel economy for the segment, matching the Subaru Ascent's turbocharged four-cylinder and the Honda Pilot's 3.5-liter V6. All Palisades come standard with blindspot collision warning, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance assist, rear occupant alert, rear park distance warning, forward collision avoidance assist, lane keeping assist, lane following assist, driver attention warning, trailer sway control, and highway driving assist. The Calligraphy trim gets forward park distance warning, parking collision avoidance assist, and upgraded forward collision avoidance assist.  Hyundai Palisade is naturally a front-wheel-drive crossover SUV. All-wheel drive is available as a $2,000 option on all trim levels except the top-of-the-line Calligraphy Night Edition, which gets it as a standard feature. HTRAC operates in front-wheel-drive when cruising around but can send up to 50% of the engine's power to the back wheel when needed. At low speeds, the driver can activate an AWD Lock function that forces the system to send at least 20% of the power to the back wheels. This is useful for driving in poor road conditions or off-road. Hyundai did a great job with cabin ergonomics with a sensible mix of touch controls and physical switchgear. There's also a variety of useful storage scattered throughout the cabin. All Palisades come standard with a 12.3-inch color touchscreen. The touchscreen comes equipped with a built-in navigation system that can receive updated maps remotely. It also comes standard with wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  Quiet Mode limits the volume of the front speakers and mutes the speakers in the rear cabin, allowing its occupants to rest without disruption on a road trip. The Passenger Talk feature amplifies the driver's voice through the speakers in the rear cabin.  Higher level trim levels get a blind-spot view monitor standard. The system uses side mirror-mounted cameras to give the driver a live view of the vehicle's blind spot through the digital gauge display when the turn signal is activated. Higher-level trims also get a head-up display (HUD) projected onto the front windshield. The HUD can be configured to present various information, including speed, the status of the advanced cruise control, and the speed limit. Hyundai's hands-free tailgate is standard on all trim levels of the Palisade except the base SE. The liftgate triggers if you stand within 3 feet of the rear bumper for more than three seconds with the key fob. This is a departure from rival systems that require the driver to swing their leg under the back bumper. The driver's seat's Ergo-Motion function uses self-adjusting inflatable air pockets to support the driver's posture and combat fatigue on long drives. When the Palisade is in Sport Mode, the air pockets inflate to provide additional lumbar support. The Palisade's rearview mirror is equipped with a smart rear-vision camera display, which comes in handy when the cabin is loaded up with cargo.  The actual camera is located near the top of the rear window. The Palisade Calligraphy's third-row of seats are not only power operated, but are also heated, perfect for those cold days. Third-row passengers are have a pair of dedicated USB-C plugs.  The Palisade Calligraphy came equipped with a 630-watt Kardon audio system.  The 12-speaker system is standard on higher trims and available as an option on the SEL trim. The 64-color ambient lightning, installed on door trims and the center console, adds a little extra panache to the cabin, especially at night. The Palisade's center console comes equipped with trick foldable cup holders that rotate to tuck away when not in use.  The Calligraphy trim comes with front, rear, and side cameras. The cameras come together to provide the driver with a 360-degree view of the Palisade and its surroundings. Right above the rearview mirror is a retractable panoramic mirror. The panoramic mirror gives the driver a clear view of the action in the back of the vehicle. Instead of a single panoramic glass roof like those found in the Subaru Ascent or Honda Pilot, the Palisade has two individual sunroofs. The smaller front sunroof opens, but the larger rear glass roof does not. The leathers, plastics, and soft-touch materials used in the cabin are exceptional, especially for a mass-market vehicle. The Palisade Calligraphy is the only trim that gets this rich Nappa leather upholstered seats.  Unlike many of its competitors, the Palisade relies upon electric motors instead of manual latches or handles to retract the second and third-row seats.  The Palisade has a hidden storage area under the center console, perfect for bags or small purses. The storage nook also houses USB-C and 12V plugs. These days spare tires are becoming increasingly rare as automakers opt for a can of fix-a-flat to save weight and money.  Fortunately, the Palisade still has a spare wheel mounted underneath the rear cargo area.

64,Jennifer Sor,"A shortage of young men in the workforce could weigh on housing, Social Security, and growth for years to come",https://www.businessinsider.com/men-not-working-unemployment-job-market-economy-housing-social-security-2024-6,"Around 7.2 million men have dropped out of the workforce. That has a host of consequences that could take decades to reverse, experts say.",2024-06-09T12:15:01Z,"America's job market is mysteriously short of young men. It's a trend experts say will drag on the economy and could take years to fix, mainly because men have already been dropping out of the workforce for decades. According to Carol Graham, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institute, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age men has been declining over the last twenty years. Today, 11% of men aged 25-54 don't have a job and aren't looking for one, more than triple the percentage recorded in 1955, when just 3% were out of the workforce, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That amounts to around 7.2 million prime working-age men who aren't working. That's introduced a host of problems for the economy, leaving key industries understaffed, and adding to the strain on government services and social safety nets, Graham and other experts told Business Insider. ""Some of them drop out [of college] and are just sort of forlorn and have no purpose or meaning in life. They're not very likely to be married. They're very likely to be living in their parent's basement,"" Graham said. ""They're lonely, they're isolated."" The economic burden can also compound through generations, she added, given that men who have exited the workforce tend to be lower-income and are more likely to report mental and physical health problems, which impact their children's ability to build wealth. Zack Mabel, a research professor at Georgetown University, theorizes that falling labor force participation among young men could impact the economy for at least several decades. ""At this point, it's a long trend over the course of multiple decades that does not appear to be improving, and could have real long-term consequences,"" he said. The economy appears to already be feeling the decline in male workforce participation. Despite a small post-pandemic rebound, US GDP per employee fell 1% in 2022, the first decline seen since the World Bank began recording productivity data over 30 years ago. The overall labor force participation rate, meanwhile, has slumped to 62%. Besides the years following the pandemic, US workforce participation rate hasn't been that low since the 70s, World Bank data shows. The trend could weigh on key industries, like infrastructure and manufacturing, where women are often less likely to seek work due to social stigma, Mabel said. That means it could be hard for those industries to find workers, which is a big problem considering the need for labor in growing areas like semiconductors, he added. ""In a situation where you have millions of men … foregoing college, and as a result are less productive and less able to hold onto a stable job, yes, that certainly would raise concerns our national productivity would suffer as a result,"" Mabel said. And while the housing market may be booming now, it is also possible that men leaving the labor force will weigh on that market as well. Meredith Whitney, a longtime Wall Street forecaster, predicts home prices could drop as much as 30% over a period of years thanks to men working less, being less interested in starting families, and being more likely to live with their parents. Those trends all weigh on household formation, which is the most important factor in determining home prices over the long term, Whitney said. 42% of men who have exited the workforce live with at least one parent, a 2017 Brookings study found. ""This is such a seismic shift in the social structure,"" she told BI. ""It's hard to say how long it lasts."" Government benefits are also hugely taxed by men who are not in the workforce. Men who have dropped out of the workforce, for one, are significantly more likely to suffer from opioid addiction, Graham said. 44% of men who were out of the workforce said they needed to take pain medication — more than double the portion recorded in employed men, where just 20% took pain meds, a separate Brookings study found. 57% of men not looking for work said they had a physical, mental, or behavioral reason, according to a survey conducted by BPC-Artemis. 11% of men who have exited the labor force rely entirely on government welfare programs for income, according to Brookings data. ""They cost the health system. They go to the emergency room and they're sick, they're not going to be able to pay the bills,"" Graham said. ""That's coming out of somewhere."" The welfare burden is exacerbated by the fact that unemployed men aren't contributing to benefit programs such as through Social Security taxes. ""Potentially, more and more people would benefit and depend on resources that we don't actually have the means to provide ... And that then would really present itself as a huge societal conundrum,"" Mabel warned. There's no clear answer for how to get young men back into the workforce. The causes appear to be multifold — disabilities, incarceration, and wages not being enticing enough, to name a few —but possible solutions could lie in helping train men for the jobs that are available, according to Graham, or finding ways to give young men role models, such as by hiring more male teachers, Mabel said. ""There's clearly an economic cost for more than one generation if the trends continue,"" Graham told BI. ""There are lots of ways it costs society in addition to their individual human lives.""

Modi misses Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed a third term this week, but his Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure an overall majority. He'll now have to rely on allies to form a government. The election result was a blow to Modi, who has governed India for a decade with an increasingly firm grip. The rebuke arrived despite Modi's record of lifting hundreds of millions of Indians out of poverty, which won praise from business titans like Jamie Dimon. Indian stock indexes fell sharply on the election results before recovering. India watchers expect the country's new government to move slower on some issues following the surprise election result. But experts believe Modi will be largely undeterred in his economic and foreign policy efforts. One pain point is India's rising unemployment rate. That could see Modi supercharge his efforts to turn India into the new factory of the world. Apple is among those investing in manufacturing in the country. He has also positioned India as a leader of the Global South, strengthening diplomatic ties with the US and pushing for a permanent position on the UN Security Council. That puts India in direct competition with China, with Modi wasting no time in needling his rival shortly after claiming victory.

Why the Sunshine Sate tops the rankings of shark bites globally.",https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-back-to-back-shark-attacks-leave-3-swimmers-injured-2024-6,"Two successive shark attacks in Walton County, Florida, left three injured on Friday, with two in a critical condition.",2024-06-09T12:38:17Z,"Two shark bite incidents just 90 minutes apart at two separate beaches on Florida's Gulf coast, left three people injured on Friday. Two people are in a critical condition, and a third is in a stable condition, South Walton Fire District Fire Chief Ryan Crawford said at a news conference. The first incident left a 45-year-old female with ""significant trauma to the midsection and pelvic area as well as amputation of the left lower arm,"" said Crawford. The woman, who had been swimming just past the first sandbar with her husband, was airlifted to a local hospital for treatment, he said. The second attack involved two girls, 15-17 years old, who had been swimming with friends just inside the first sandbar in waist-deep water. One victim received ""significant injuries to one upper and one lower extremity,"" and the other had ""flesh wounds on her foot,"" said Crawford. While the risk of being attacked by a shark is extremely low, Florida, famous for its beaches and all-year-round sunshine, has consistently topped global charts for the number of shark bites. According to a comprehensive database of all known shark attacks compiled by staff at Florida's Museum of Natural History, in 2023, there were 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans and 22 provoked bites worldwide. Florida's 16 cases in 2023 represent 44% of the US total and 23% of unprovoked bites worldwide. Volusia County on Florida's east coast — which includes the renowned Daytona Beach and New Smyrna Beach — has been dubbed the ""shark bite capital of the world,"" with 343 recorded shark bites from 1882-2023. In an interview with Business Insider last year, Gavin Naylor, the director of The Florida Program of Shark Research, said in an email that a combination of factors off the coast of Volusia increased the likelihood of a shark attack. They included a high density of mullet and menhaden baitfish and a lot of good waves for surfing. The churning water resulted in poor visibility for sharks, which, on rare occasions, bite at arms and legs ""dangling off"" surfboards by mistake as they chase their natural prey in the murky water, said Naylor. Blacktip and bull sharks are responsible for most of the attacks in Florida. September is the most common time of year for shark attacks in the Sunshine State, and the place with the highest chance of being bitten is in Volusia County, between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., ISAF statistics suggest.

The film will recount the true story of Noam Tibon, a retired Israeli general who gained international attention when he rescued his family from Hamas gunmen during an attack on Nahal Oz, their kibbutz in southern Israel, on October 7, 2023, Deadline reported. Hamas launched an assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip, resulting in nearly 1,200 deaths, primarily among Israeli citizens. Noam's son, award-winning journalist Amir Tibon, was sheltering in their kibbutz in southern Israel from Hamas gunfire with his wife and their two daughters.

Armed only with a handgun, Noam battled Palestinian gunmen along the way and rescued survivors of the music festival massacre. He also helped wounded Israeli soldiers, his son said. Amir told The Atlantic, ""After 10 hours, we hear a large bang on the window, and we hear the voice of my father. Galia, my oldest daughter, says, 'Saba higea' — 'Grandfather is here.'

68,Tom Carter,EVs are too expensive. Here are 5 cheaper models coming soon.,https://www.businessinsider.com/evs-too-expensive-5-upcoming-affordable-models-kia-chevy-volvo-2024-6,"Demand for electric vehicles has slowed amid a lack of cheaper options, and carmakers are now scrambling to get more affordable EVs on the road.",2024-06-09T13:55:01Z,"EVs have an affordability problem. Demand for electric vehicles has slowed in recent months amid a lack of cheaper options, and carmakers are now scrambling to develop more affordable EVs. According to Edmunds data, the average transaction price of an EV in 2023 was $61,702 versus $47,450 for other vehicles. That affordability gap seems to be deterring would-be EV buyers, with some opting to go for hybrid vehicles instead, which are typically cheaper than fully electric vehicles. Luckily for these consumers, the next few years should see a range of more affordable electric vehicles released. Big hitters like Tesla and Ford are teasing the release of cheaper models to join the likes of Nissan and Mini, who already offer lower-cost options.  Here are some other new affordable EV options coming soon: The Volvo EX30 is set to hit US shores this summer — and it will boast a competitive $35,000 price tag. The EX30 has an estimated 275-mile range and can go from zero to 60 mph in under four seconds. One Volvo sales manager described it as a ""game-changer,"" telling Reuters that his dealership had already taken deposits for every EX30 they expect to receive. Volvo's latest offering also has a stylish design and a high-tech interior — as Business Insider found when we got an early look last year. Kia and its South Korean parent company, Hyundai, have seen US sales surge this year as they cash in on demand for more affordable EVs. Kia is planning to take advantage of that with the EV3, a compact electric SUV with 373 miles of range and can charge from 10% to 80% in 31 minutes. Deliveries of the EV3 are expected to begin in Korea and Europe later this year, with the EV reportedly expected to cost around $35,000. US customers will have to wait a little longer, however — a company spokesperson confirmed to BI that the EV3 will be coming to the US, but did not say when it will go on sale. Chevy, the GM sub-brand, aims to release a new lineup of electric models over the coming years. The company has set its target on more affordable EVs, too. Chevy's $43,295 Equinox EV went on sale in May. It also has a $35,000 version of the 319-mile range electric crossover coming later this year — which could sell for less than $30,000 with the $7,500 federal tax credit for US-made EVs. Chevy also plans to relaunch the Chevy Bolt, formerly America's cheapest EV, after it halted its production last December. The automaker has said the new Bolt will be available next year and will be the ""most affordable"" EV on the market — suggesting a sticker price below $30,000. German automaker VW abandoned plans to build affordable EVs with European rival Renault last month, and is planning to go solo. In May, the company said it plans to produce EVs priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,000) by 2027. In a step toward that, VW revealed its ID. 2all battery-powered hatchback last year. When it enters production in 2026, it expects it to cost 25,000 euros ($27,000) or less. US customers hoping to buy one will be disappointed, however. A VW spokesperson told BI at the time that it has no plans to bring this model to the US right now. Rivian founder RJ Scaringe pulled off a Steve Jobs-style ""one more thing"" when he unveiled two new affordable EVs in March. The Tesla rival announced its R2 SUV, which is expected to start at $45,000 when deliveries begin in early 2026 — a big upgrade on the R1S, which currently starts at $75,900. That lower sticker price will allow Rivian to compete with Tesla in the mass market. However, it was the R3 — which Scaringe also unveiled in March — that turned heads. Few details have been revealed about the new vehicle, but the company confirmed the R3 would cost less than the R2, and that deliveries will start sometime after 2026.

69,Katie Balevic,Here's an idea: a worldwide universal basic income paid for by a carbon tax. A study found that it could boost the global GDP by 130%.,https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-carbon-taxes-global-gdp-sustainability-2024-6,"A global universal basic income funded by carbon taxes could grow the global GDP by 130% while promoting sustainability, a study found. Sounds great, right?",2024-06-09T14:41:09Z,"Some might say a universal basic income is wishful thinking, but one study suggests it could have staggering impacts on the global economy. Researchers behind the newly published study, called ""Utilizing basic income to create a sustainable, poverty-free tomorrow,"" outlined how universal basic income could provide a ""two-pronged solution to both environmental sustainability and social resilience"" that could grow the global GDP from 39% up to 130%. Basic income pilots gained popularity after the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused record-high unemployment — nearly 15% — in the United States in early 2020. Most American programs are guaranteed basic income pilots, which provide a specific demographic of people with a set amount of cash with no strings attached for a predetermined time period. A universal basic income program, or UBI, would provide regular cash payments to everyone. Rashid Sumaila, the study's primary author at the University of British Columbia, found that a UBI funded by carbon taxes on a global scale would be costly upfront but pay off in spades. The study said that it could cost a third of global GDP to operate, but would result in an overall increase of the global GDP by as much as 130%. ""I must concede that the US may be the last place to engage with our proposal for all sorts of reasons,"" Sumaila told Business Insider. ""But the situation may not persist forever as there are indications that Gen Z and millennials seem to care relatively more about tackling both climate change and inequality than older Americans."" Basic income pilots in America have met with opposition from conservative lawmakers. One representative in Iowa, which moved to ban such programs, called it ""socialism on steroids."" In other parts of the world, however, the idea enjoys wide political support. South Africa is on track to be the first country to adopt a universal basic income. Sumaila and the study's other co-authors focused on funding this global UBI plan through a carbon tax ""because of the global push to reduce carbon emissions to reach sustainability goals,"" the study says. They found that a carbon tax could generate trillions annually, depending on the scale of the flat tax. ""In theory, it is a beautiful idea to use basic income to help people, sustain nature, and boost the economy. It also seems possible to raise a big chunk of the funds needed to do this by taxing C02 emitters, degraders of biodiversity, overfishers, deforesters, plastic polluters, oil spillers, and the agricultural sector,"" Sumaila told Business Insider.

70,Eliza Relman,A working-class immigrant neighborhood in Queens banned cars along a major road. The new park is a 'superhighway of kids and families and neighbors.',https://www.businessinsider.com/queens-jackson-heights-bans-cars-open-streets-parks-new-york-2024-6,"Jackson Heights, Queens, was the 'epicenter of the epicenter' of COVID-19. Now, it's a model for reclaiming public space.",2024-06-09T09:32:01Z,"On a recent sunny Friday afternoon in Jackson Heights, Queens, dozens of migrants filled out applications for asylum at folding tables set up in the street outside a local elementary school. Former Manhattan prosecutor Nuala O'Doherty-Naranjo, who operates the free legal clinic three days a week, sat nearby answering questions. In good weather, she and her team — all volunteers — hold the clinic in the street, which was recently transformed into a car-free public plaza. Steps away, kids played soccer, a little girl tested out the training wheels on her bicycle, and a neighbor led a free crocheting class. Just a few years ago, that same road — 34th Avenue — was a traffic-clogged artery. But a years-long, grass-roots effort has turned a 1.3-mile-long, 26-block stretch of the avenue — which the city council renamed Paseo Park — into the crown jewel of New York City's embattled Open Streets Initiative. As New York Gov. Kathy Hochul reverses the city's attempt to reduce congestion in Manhattan, Jackson Heights has managed to cement its open street into a feature the community isn't willing to give up. O'Doherty-Naranjo remembers that the principal of a public middle school on 34th Avenue — one of nine schools with thousands of students within about 35 blocks — had to direct traffic as kids filtered across the street at dismissal, fighting for space with drivers. ""Drivers would literally just scream and honk at the principal as a thousand kids are crossing the district,"" said O'Doherty-Naranjo, who was the president of the school's parent-teacher association. Then, one afternoon in March 2019, a 12-year-old boy was hit and seriously injured by a driver in a Jeep outside another of 34th Avenue's middle schools. That tragedy spurred meetings between the schools, the police department, DOT, and safe street advocates to speed the process of restricting vehicle traffic during certain hours. Not long after, the pandemic hit. Suddenly, schools were closed and traffic slowed to a trickle. Central Queens' working-class immigrant neighborhoods had become the ""epicenter of the epicenter"" of the virus. Nearby, Elmhurst Hospital Center became one of the hardest-hit medical centers in the country. The lockdown also shed a harsh spotlight on the area's lack of green space. Jackson Heights has among the least amount of park space of any New York City neighborhood. With people cooped up in small apartments, O'Doherty-Naranjo and a group of other neighbors decided to start pushing to restrict traffic along most of 34th Avenue. They got the go-ahead, but they needed manpower to enforce it. About 100 volunteers were soon recruited to help set up and take down metal barricades at each intersection every morning and night to block the street from through traffic. These days, 34th Avenue is the neighborhood's public backyard. All pass-through vehicle traffic is prohibited between 7 am and 8 pm every day of the year, although cars can still park on all of the blocks that aren't plazas. The blocks immediately outside each school are permanently vehicle-free, an increasingly popular safety measure around the world. Residents have cleaner air and quieter and safer streets, as well as a community space they desperately need. Traffic accidents on 34th Avenue involving pedestrians are down 61%, according to the City Department of Transportation, and crashes with injuries are down 34%. On a Friday afternoon in late May, 19-year-old City College student Braulio Tellez hung out eating pizza with his mom and sister while perched on the tree-lined median that runs along the center of the open street. Tellez grew up in the neighborhood and sometimes carries his telescope out at night to observe the moon and planets from the quiet of the road. ""It helps remove all stress,"" Tellez said of the traffic-restricted street. ""I love it."" Jim Burke, a longtime pedestrian and transit advocate, had lived in his apartment building right on 34th Avenue for a dozen years when the pandemic hit. But he knew virtually none of his neighbors. In the early days of the pandemic, bored in their apartment, Burke and his partner started regularly playing a coin-tossing game in the street. Soon, neighbors and kids began joining in. Burke grew up in the Bronx and the Rockaways and remembers that as kids, he and his friends ""owned the streets,"" where they played every day. He figured adults and kids alike should have that same experience on 34th Avenue. ""One thing led to another and then we started raising money,"" Burke said. ""People looked out their windows and said, 'Oh that looks like fun, I don't want to stay in my house for another minute.'"" O'Doherty-Naranjo and Burke co-founded the 34th Avenue Open Streets Coalition and used the funds they raised to put on programming — hiring yoga and Zumba instructors to teach free classes, volunteers to lead English lessons, and even enlisting doctors to dispense free medical advice. The effort was entirely volunteer-powered for the first 18 months before the city stepped in to help. ""In the summer, I see a lot of people doing activities, or going out, walking, kids playing with chalk — just cool things that I didn't have when growing up,"" said Yorladiz, a Jackson Heights native who regularly walks her four-year-old daughter up and down 34th Avenue. ""It's yoga night, it's salsa night — they're always doing something."" These days, Burke can't spend more than a few minutes on 34th Avenue without running into a neighbor he knows. ""It's become this superhighway of kids and families and neighbors,"" O'Doherty-Naranjo said. These days, controversy on 34th Avenue mostly concerns a surge in mopeds, which tend to use the street as a cut-through. Shekar Krishnan, the councilman who represents the neighborhood, held a ""Moped Crisis"" town hall recently and says the City needs to come up with a plan to redesign the street to keep mopeds off of it and create safer ways for them to travel on other streets. If the Department of Transportation is going ""to oversee the expansion of public space, in addition to their other work,"" Krishnan said, ""they need to get far more serious, and ambitious, and creative in how they do so — and, frankly, listen to the communities."" Burke and O'Doherty-Naranjo don't want to ban mopeds from 34th Avenue. They recognize that other streets often aren't safe for moped drivers, many of whom are delivery workers. Funding for open streets can be hard to come by, however. Across the city, 83 miles of open streets dwindled to about 20 miles between 2020 and 2022. DOT only allots $20,000 a year for 34th Avenue, Burke said, which is just a fraction of the funds needed to operate the open street all year round. The city has also been slow to reimburse neighborhood groups supporting open streets across the city. Burke estimates 34th Avenue needs at least $50,000 a year to operate with a decent amount of programming — and the City still owes it $10,000 from last year. The more money the street has, the more instructors, artists, and musicians it can pay to lead workshops, beautify the street, and put on performances. Unlike many other open streets across the city, 34th Avenue isn't a commercial street — it's entirely residential in between its many schools and one small park. ""A lot of the places that New York City has done these kind of more groundbreaking projects, they've been in wealthy neighborhoods,"" Dawn Siff, the director of the Alliance for Paseo Park, a nonprofit supporting the open street. Siff and others hope 34th Avenue will become a public park that prioritizes people on foot. She pointed to models in cities like Mexico City and Paris. Just across the East River, there's a great model in Manhattan's High Line. O'Doherty-Naranjo and Burke want to see the open street extended all the way down to the end of 34th Avenue near Citi Field. They all envision a greener street, with flood mitigation like rain gardens — and more public art. Burke said he hopes the city will eventually be filled with connected open streets. ""Someday, my dream would be to interconnect them, where you could visit every neighborhood,"" he said, ""and you could do so by traveling on an open street with your family, whether you're walking, or using a wheelchair, or biking.""

71,Grace Eliza Goodwin,Apple is making email more bearable,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-makes-email-more-bearable-mail-app-ai-features-2024-6,"Apple unveiled new Mail app features at WWDC, including enhanced categorization, AI-powered writing tools, and Siri capabilities.",2024-06-10T21:34:33Z,"Managing your email app — and even just searching for an email you know is in there somewhere — can be unbearable. But Apple is trying to change that. At Apple's WWDC event on Monday, company executives announced a number of new features that will likely make the Mail app much easier to use across Apple devices, and even make it function more like an executive assistant. Here's what you need to know about the latest email updates Apple is rolling out. Apple is introducing new categories into its Mail app that will help you better manage and organize incoming emails. Some of this may sound familiar to Gmail users, but there are also some differences. A ""primary"" category will gather together your most important messages at the top, like emails from people you know and time-sensitive emails, Ronak Shah, Apple's director of internet technologies product marketing, said at the event. Everything else will be divided into new categories like ""'transactions' for receipts and order confirmations, 'updates' for newsletters and social media notices, and 'promotions' for marketing and sales messages,"" Shah explained. In addition to these categories, the Mail app will also soon have a ""digest"" view that will assemble all emails from a business in one place. For example, all your emails from United Airlines will appear in one grouping so you can see all your flight information without having to search or scour your inbox. You'll also still be able to see all your emails in one place, and you can recategorize your messages as much as you want, Ronak said, adding that the categorization feature will become available later this year. Thanks to Apple's new generative AI system, Apple Intelligence, some smart AI-powered writing tools will be integrated across Apple apps, including the Mail app. With Apple Intelligence, you'll be able to pull up a sidebar from the Mail app that will help you rewrite an email draft. For example, you can choose options to make the tone of your email more ""friendly,"" more ""professional,"" or more ""concise."" You can also choose the ""summary"" or ""key points"" options to add TL;DRs to your emails. Smart Reply can also help you identify and answer questions you were asked in a previous email. And, in the Mail app, you'll also be able to see summaries of emails instead of just short previews. Apple's new and improved Siri can also help you track down that hard-to-remember item. When you're trying to remember something, like a book recommendation a friend sent you — but can't remember if it was from an email or a text message or a shared note — Siri will be able to surface it down for you, Kelsey Peterson, Apple's director of machine learning and AI, said at the conference. You'll also be able to ask Siri things like, ""When is my mom's flight landing?"" And in response, Siri will find the email with your mom's flight information, and cross-reference it with real-time flight-tracking info to give you her most accurate arrival time, Kelsey explained.

72,Ana Altchek,The best new features in iOS 18,https://www.businessinsider.com/best-apple-ios-18-features-2024-6,"iPhone users will be able to schedule texts,  filter out content from their Photos app, and hide private apps.",2024-06-10T22:46:15Z,"Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference took place on June 10, and it included some pretty big updates. The tech giant unveiled updates to a wide range of apps and features, including Mail, Photos, iMessage, and Apple Wallet. As expected, Apple also revealed some new updates to its generative artificial intelligence efforts. Apple's iPhone operating system, iOS 18, was a major topic of discussion at the event, and it's expected to be released later this year. Here are some of the changes we're most excited about iOS 18. Apple iOS 18 will let you customize your home screen wallpaper, app icons, and widgets. Users will be able to move their widgets to better fit their backgrounds, rather than lining them up from the top and filling each space before creating a new row. The update also offers a new customization sheet that lets you tint app icons with different colors. It also added Dark Mode, which tints apps. Director of internet technologies product marketing Ronak Shah said this is a ""huge year for Tapbacks."" iOS 18 will now allow users to tap back on a message with any emoji or sticker. The update brings it closer to other messaging platforms like Google Chat, Slack, or WhatsApp. The new update also lets you schedule messages in advance, which is a popular feature on apps like Slack. You'll also have more ways to express tone over text with the ability to bold, italicize, underline, or strikethrough any text. You can also visually amplify messages with text effects like making them jitter, bloom, or shake. Shah said some words and phrases will automatically suggest a text effect, so you can quickly select it. Apple is bringing its biggest redesign to Photos with iOS 18, according to senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi. The app will be unified into a single view with a photo grid at the top and your library organized by theme at the bottom. With the new update, you can declutter your app from things like screenshots by filtering them out. You can also select months or years to quickly jump to specific dates. Collections organizes your photos into specific topics, such as Recent Days, People and Pets, and Trips. You can also pin specific collections that are most important to you or that you plan to access frequently. Apple is offering new ways to improve app privacy with iOS 18, and one of the new features lets you add apps to a locked folder to keep others from seeing them on your phone. The update also allows you to require Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to access certain apps. Information from inside the app will also be hidden from other places in the system, like search, notifications, or call history. Apple Pay just gained a leg up on Venmo and Zelle. The new Tap to Cash update makes transactions more seamless than ever by allowing users to exchange Apple cash with each other without sharing a phone number or email address. All you have to do is hold your iPhone against another to send a payment to it. Apple Maps will have topographic maps with detailed trail networks and hiking routes with iOS 18. The new update includes all 63 US national parks. It can be saved to your phone and accessed offline while you're in a remote area. It offers turn-by-turn voice guidance to give you directions along the way. Apple will be integrating a much-anticipated generative AI system into iOS 18. The new technology ""harnesses the power of Apple silicon"" to ""create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks,"" Apple said in a statement. The update will give Siri a new look that has an ""elegant glowing light"" that wraps around the edge of your screen. The tool will have better language understanding capabilities. It will also add systemwide Writing Tools and Image Playground, which lets users create playful images and use them in messages. Apple also announced its partnership with OpenAI, which will let users opt into integrating ChatGPT into Apple's software. This will allow users to use ChatGPT through Siri or when completing tasks within apps on their iPhone. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

The company announced Monday that Sarah Friar and Kevin Weil would be its new chief financial officer and chief product officer, respectively. ""Sarah and Kevin bring a depth of experience that will enable OpenAI to scale our operations, set a strategy for the next phase of growth, and ensure that our teams have the resources they need to continue to thrive,"" Altman said in the announcement. In a post on X, Weil said OpenAI's mission was ""perhaps the most important and transformative of them all."" I’m super excited to announce that I’m joining @OpenAI as Chief Product Officer!My entire career has been about working on big missions: connecting people and ideas at @Instagram and @Twitter, digitizing financial services at Libra/Novi, or most recently at @Planet, using space… Friar was most recently CEO of Nextdoor and had previously served as Square's CFO. She's also worked at Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and Salesforce. Weil was the head of product and business for Planet Labs, as well as the cofounder of the Libra cryptocurrency, the vice president of product for Novi at Facebook, the vice president of product at Instagram, and the senior vice president of product at Twitter. The announcement came after OpenAI — and Altman's leadership in particular — received scrutiny because of safety concerns as AI evolves. ""The world isn't ready, and we aren't ready,"" Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher, wrote in an email announcing his resignation, according to The New York Times ""I'm concerned we are rushing forward regardless and rationalizing our actions."" Several other researchers have resigned from OpenAI as concerns mount about its governance and whether it's moving toward a more profit-oriented approach. In a statement, Friar said: ""My goal is to help OpenAI continue excelling at what it does best — producing top-tier research and collaborating to maximize the benefits of AI tools for everyone.""

74,Annie Midori Atherton,"I have enough saved for a down payment, but I don't see any reason to stop renting",https://www.businessinsider.com/still-renting-even-though-can-afford-down-payment-house-2024-6,"I could afford a down payment with my savings, but homeownership isn't the only way I can succeed financially — and right now, it's not for me.",2024-06-10T16:08:45Z,"In the US, the path to financial success seems set in stone: Get a degree, get a steady job, and buy a house. I was on this path myself, checking off the first two boxes on a predictable timeline. Yet at 36, married and with a toddler, I'm still renting a two-bedroom basement apartment in Seattle — not because I have to but because it's the best choice for us right now. Despite the deeply ingrained cultural norm of glorifying homeownership, I've decided not to feel bad about renting. It affords us multiple luxuries: living in a beautiful neighborhood we could not afford to buy in, being near family and friends, paying far less in rent than we would on a mortgage, and spending almost no time or money on home maintenance. Technically, I have enough saved to afford a 20% down payment on the average American home — about $433,000 as of April, according to Redfin. This is an incredible privilege. While I did save quite a bit myself, the only reason I can even entertain the idea of owning is that I was left an inheritance two years ago. As soon as I had enough, I started looking into buying. But then interest rates went up, while houses did not get cheaper, and supply did not increase. A typical monthly mortgage payment in our area is now higher than $5,000, and a recent report from Zillow found that to afford the typical home in Seattle, a household needed to earn more than $200,000 a year. Meanwhile, I had a baby and shifted to freelance journalism, making my income more precarious. So I faced the facts: We could afford to buy a house but not in our neighborhood, which is where I grew up and where my extended family still lives. Anywhere in the area, the ownership costs — including a mortgage, homeowner's insurance, and property taxes — would be far higher than our rent. Right now, we have plenty of extra cash for fun social outings and small indulgences. That would not be the case if we owned. Factor in unforeseen expenses such as repairs, and we'd have to pinch pennies ruthlessly. In this season of life, when my kid is so young, and I'm still navigating a new career, living on such a tight budget seems deeply stressful. While there are other compromises we could make, none of them seem worth it. We toured a townhouse awhile back that cost $400,000, but it was so cramped and charmless that the thought of spending our hard-earned savings on it was demoralizing. If I'm going to commit hundreds of thousands of dollars, I want to at least like the place. Leaving the city is another option. The problem is, we love where we live, with its tree-lined streets and nearby waterfront. Plus, being near trusted relatives feels like a priceless resource now that we have a child. Alternatively, I could get a job that pays more. But I love my work. It allows me to set my own hours, work from anywhere, and prioritize parenting at a time when my child has medical needs that require my attention. I earn more than enough for my modest needs. It wasn't always like this. In just 10 years, median home prices in Washington have increased by more than 170%. The housing-affordability crisis is largely a failure of policy. It's not right that gainfully employed people can't afford to buy a house in many cities anymore. We need more housing. While I wish owning were more accessible, I also wish we had policies that made long-term renting an easier financial choice for those who prefer it for lifestyle reasons. Honestly, that would include me. I write about houses for work, and I have interviewed hundreds of people about their remodels and DIY projects. Many of them see this as a labor of love, but there's no denying that it is labor. There's always something that needs fixing, painting, repairing, or updating. It's fascinating to learn about, but it makes me appreciate the relative ease of renting. Rather than spending my Saturdays at the hardware store, I can just hang out and relax. I understand the financial case for homeownership, so if it makes sense in the future, I'd be happy to change my mind. However, it's not the only way to build financial security. We max out our tax-sheltered retirement accounts and put most of our money in a high-yield savings account with Betterment Cash Reserve. Ultimately, what I've realized is that a house is not merely a financial decision. It's my home, where I spend most of my time. If enjoying my home means renting for now, I'll continue to do that without shame.  Select all that apply Thanks for your input!"
75,Taylor Rains,An activist investor with a new $1.9 billion stake in Southwest is calling for big changes at the airline,https://www.businessinsider.com/southwest-airlines-call-for-changes-new-leadership-ceo-elliott-management-2024-6,"Southwest touts itself as the ""LUV"" airline with free checked bags and no change fees. An activist hedge fund says it needs a turnaround.",2024-06-10T18:23:26Z,"Southwest Airlines touts itself as the ""LUV"" carrier, with its two free checked bags and comedic flight crews — a strategy that revolutionized low-cost air travel and earned the carrier a 47-year profitability streak from 1973 to 2019. However, Elliott Investment Management said Monday that the airline's decades-old strategies weren't working in modern times, and it's calling for a management and board-of-directors overhaul as part of a plan it's calling ""Stronger Southwest."" ""Poor execution and leadership's stubborn unwillingness to evolve the Company's strategy have led to deeply disappointing results for shareholders, employees and customers alike,"" the activist investment firm said in a letter announcing a new $1.9 billion stake, which makes it among the company's largest shareholders. Elliott said Southwest leadership had a ""rigid commitment"" to the model it dreamed up decades ago, blaming that for today's shortcomings. It cited a major meltdown in December 2022 that affected millions of passengers, which stemmed from antiquated crew-scheduling systems and resulted in snowballing cancellations across the country. ""No senior executives were terminated for their role in the meltdown,"" it said. Elliott would also like to see new, outside talent on the board of directors. Southwest's stock price has fallen more than 50% in three years, Elliot said, underperforming some competitors and falling below 2020 levels. ""The mandate from the Board has been clear: Keep doing things the way they have always been done,"" the letter said. Elliott added that its ideas could help push the stock up 77% to $49 a share. Shares rose more than 7% in trading Monday after Elliott unveiled its stake. Southwest told Business Insider that it looked forward to ""better understanding their views on our company"" and defended its board and executive team. ""The Southwest Board of Directors is confident in our CEO and management's ability to execute against the company's strategic plan to drive long-term value for all shareholders, safely and reliably serve our customers, and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders,"" a spokesperson said. Raymond James' airline analyst Savanthi Syth said Southwest could improve its financial performance with better customer service and route enhancements, pointing to red-eye flights and suggesting the prospect of assigned seating. ""We are not surprised by activist interest in Southwest given the very strong franchise with valuable tangible and intangible assets,"" she said. She added that Southwest had ""correctly"" started to scale back its ambitious growth plans and had the opportunity to address outdated technology. Elliott Management, which oversees $66 billion in assets, is one of the world's most feared activist hedge funds. Beyond Southwest, the firm recently disclosed positions in Texas Instruments, the mining company Anglo American, and Match Group, the online-dating company behind Tinder. ""After 18 months of intensive research, we are convinced that Southwest represents the most compelling airline turnaround opportunity in the last two decades,"" Elliott said. ""The significant investment we have made reflects our conviction that, with the right leadership, Southwest can regain its status as an industry-leading airline.""

Now the oil giant is making sure that doesn't happen again. BP informed all employees last week that they must disclose any intimate relationships with colleagues, or they could face disciplinary action, the company confirmed to Business Insider.  This includes dismissal in some circumstances, Reuters reported. Under the new policy, employees are also prohibited ""from directly or indirectly managing relatives or those with whom they're in an intimate relationship,"" according to a memo sent to staff and seen Reuters. BP has updated its code of conduct to reflect the changes. The company also confirmed to BI that it has also told thousands of senior managers that they have until September 1 to declare any intimate relationships from the last three years. In contrast to its previous policy, workers must now report relationships regardless of whether they feel there could be a conflict of interest, BP told BI in a statement. Previously, it was only necessary if they felt there was a conflict of interest. The move comes after former CEO Bernard Looney left the company last September for failing to fully disclose details of past ""personal relationships"" with colleagues. BP started investigating Looney's relationships with colleagues in 2022 after receiving an anonymous tip-off. The CEO was consulted during the process but later admitted to having hidden some details about those relationships. His behavior amounted to ""serious misconduct,"" according to the board, and Looney lost his job and more than $40 million in compensation. BP's shares dropped following his resignation and have continued to underperform against rivals. Looney was replaced by Murray Auchincloss, who took over as CEO in January. While some organizations fully prohibit workplace relationships, the majority simply discourage them. Disclosure is often a key part of that, particularly when it comes to staff and those who evaluate or manage them. ""Most of the time, purely disclosing it would solve the problem,"" Johnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO of Society for HR Management, previously told Business Insider.  ""It's hard to have a disclosure policy and then say to someone, 'Once you disclose, I'm going to fire you.'""

77,Chris Panella,China just showed how easily one of its massive drills around Taiwan could escalate into something worse,https://www.businessinsider.com/china-showed-how-easily-no-notice-it-can-surround-taiwan-2024-6,"Through regular military drills around the island, China can maintain the element of surprise and quickly form a blockade or quarantine.",2024-06-11T11:47:02Z,"Last month, China conducted large-scale military exercises around Taiwan with the intent to send a message. As elements of the Chinese joint force surrounded the island democracy for the two-day event, it became clear how easily one of these massive drills could escalate into conflict, giving China the ability to launch a blockade or quarantine of the island with little to no warning. The Chinese armed forces have been able to ""essentially start mounting an increased tempo of these large-scale drills that have a lot of the makings of a blockade,"" Tom Shugart, a former US Navy officer and current adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, said. He added that the May exercise showed that China's fleet ""is very well suited"" for a blockade or quarantine of Taiwan. The Department of Defense has identified a blockade as a possibility, noting in its most recent report on the Chinese military that ""PLA writings describe a Joint Blockade Campaign in which the PRC would employ blockades of maritime and air traffic, including a cut-off of Taiwan's vital imports, to force Taiwan's capitulation."" If effectively executed, such action would potentially have immediate and dire consequences for Taiwan's economy, cutting off its trade and shipping. Such a move could force its military into action without necessarily triggering a military response from the US and its allies, possibly leaving it to stand alone. After the most recent Chinese military drills, US Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo said the US observed the exercises closely, learning from them and assessing that they ""looked like a rehearsal"" for a military action against Taiwan. There has long been speculation that the US would respond with force to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, but the US response in the case of a blockade or quarantine, actions short of an amphibious assault, remains unclear. China's recent exercise ""Joint Sword"" focused on ""joint sea-air combat readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets,"" according to Chinese state media reports. The training included mock strikes by fighter jets with live ammunition and drills with various naval vessels, including frigates and destroyers. The exercise appeared similar, in many respects, to the drills in April 2023 and notably tamer than the August 2022 drills, which occurred after then-US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. The latest exercise lasted only two days compared to seven. And the Chinese-declared zones for May's drills were also only along the edges of Taiwan's contiguous zone, compared to the 2022 drills, which featured large exclusion zones that crossed into Taiwan's airspace and waters. During those exercises, China also fired missiles over the island, a highly provocative action. Yet the latest exercise came with almost no warning, suggesting China can continue conducting such drills surrounding Taiwan at its leisure and prepare for and launch them with minimal notice. ""This is less a distinct operation and more just a step up in tempo,"" Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and strategist focusing on evolutions in warfare, told BI. ""What this shows us,"" Ryan said, ""is that they have an ongoing operation which they can kind of turn the temperature up and down on with more fidelity now than they have been able to previously."" That would help China, were it to suddenly pursue a more aggressive course, maintain the element of surprise, which its war doctrine emphasizes as a key component of its fighting plans. By increasing the frequency of and normalizing its military presence around Taiwan, China is adopting what experts and military officials, including retired Adm. John Aquilino, the former head of US INDOPACOM, have referred to as a ""boiling frog"" strategy. The strategy essentially involves stepping up and maintaining aggression in the area so that the critical point when China actually decides to enact a blockade or quarantine is less discernible. Such an event would be an act of war, but it still leaves the US and its allies in an odd place, weighing options as to how to respond, especially if it is short of large-scale violence. Think tanks have played out war games of different Taiwan invasion scenarios, some of which have resulted in heavy losses for US, Japanese, and South Korean forces, as well as China's military. An all-out invasion isn't the only option though, as the recent drills demonstrated. ""The exercise really highlights the vulnerability of Taiwan to a lot of other scenarios than just invasion,"" Shugart said, noting that regardless of when or if one of these large drills transitions into a blockade, the most concerning issues are how easily that could occur and how China continues to use its military presence to create a new normal in the area. And within that new norm, China could create a situation in which Taiwan, exhausted and overwhelmed, is fractured, its resolve ultimately degraded. Per a report published last month by war experts from the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War, an aggressive Chinese coercion campaign — short of war and more likely than a full-scale invasion — would involve boosting the Chinese military presence and pressure around Taiwan and possibly even a blockade or quarantine. The report asserted that the US is ill-equipped for such an event, instead overly preoccupied with preparing for a potential amphibious assault, and that ""Taiwan is strategically vital to the larger US-led coalition to contain"" China, arguing that a ""US-friendly Taiwan links America's allies in the northwestern Pacific with US partners and allies to the south."" However, a China-controlled Taiwan ""would become a springboard for further PRC aggression and would seriously compromise the US-led coalition's ability to operate cohesively.""

78,Shubhangi Goel,"She's a 27-year-old electrician — and she makes $200,000 a year off social media posts about her job",https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-electrician-influencer-makes-thousands-money-tiktok-blue-collar-2024-6,"Since 2022,  Lexis Czumak-Abreu has amassed 2.2 million followers, who watch her work as an electrician.",2024-06-11T06:49:23Z,"Lexis Czumak-Abreu graduated from college with a premed degree but decided it wasn't a good fit for her. Instead of taking another job in healthcare or a science-related field, Czumak-Abreu became a full-time electrician, she told Business Insider last month. Since 2022, she's amassed about 2.2 million followers on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, who watch her lug heavy gear and fix masses of wires — all part of the day-to-day duties of her job as an electrician. The big money doesn't come from her employer: Czumak-Abreu makes $200,000 a year from her social-media pages, including from brand deals with companies, she told The Wall Street Journal. The average electrician makes about $70,000 a year in New York state, and the average social-media influencer makes about $58,000, according to ZipRecruiter data. Despite the money she makes on social media, Czumak-Abreu decided not to cut her hours working for an electrical-servicing company, telling the Journal she wants her employer to know she's a reliable employee. And working fewer hours would give her less material to post about since the bulk of her feed follows her life as an electrician. She said that she films and edits all her videos herself and spends her lunch breaks and nights editing footage. ""There are definitely weeks when I crash and get completely overloaded,"" she told the Journal. ""Unlike in an office job where you go to the same building daily, I work somewhere different every day. I experience different things and see different people every day,"" Czumak-Abreu previously told BI. The interest in trade work comes as more Gen Z Americans weigh the pros and cons of a four-year college degree. The cost of attending university is outpacing the rate of inflation, leaving young people to take out student loans that could weigh on them far after graduation. And a college degree, even in top fields, no longer guarantees a path to a lucrative starter job. Only one in four Americans think it's very important to have a college degree for a high-paying job, a Pew Research survey of 5,000 US adults released last month found. Because of the time and money it takes to get a conventional degree, more young people are ditching diplomas for tool belts. The National Student Clearinghouse reported that enrollment in vocational-focused community colleges rose about 16% last year — its highest level since the educational nonprofit began tracking the data in 2018. Elaina Farnsworth, a cofounder of SkillFusion, a credentialing program for electric-vehicle technicians, told BI last month that she noticed a significant increase in Gen Z workers applying for her program.

79,Ayomikun Adekaiyero,15 celebrities who have come out in 2024,https://www.businessinsider.com/lgbtq-celebrities-actors-reality-stars-who-came-out-in-2024-2024-6,"Here are some of the biggest names who have opened up about their sexuality or gender identity this year, including Reneé Rapp and Sophia Bush.",2024-06-12T17:06:59Z,"We are halfway through 2024, and 15 celebrities have spoken about their sexuality and gender identity for the first time. In the last few years, some critics have questioned whether stars still need to announce they are coming out, as wider society becomes more accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. But Renée Rapp, Deshawn Radden, and other stars have said they hope that talking about their journeys could help any fans struggling with their LGBTQ+ identity. Sophia Bush wrote in an essay for Glamour in April that she thought it was especially important to be vocal about her sexuality after she saw that state legislators had introduced more than 500 anti-LGBTQ bills in 2023. Here are 15 stars who have come out in 2024 and what they have said about their journey. In October 2023, multiple outlets reported that Sophia Bush was dating soccer player Ashlyn Harris. This news came shortly after Harris and her ex-wife Ali Krieger filed for divorce, so some fans called Harris a cheater and accused Bush of being a ""homewrecker."" Harris denied the cheating allegations in a statement in November 2023. In April, Bush came out as queer in an essay for Glamour's cover story about her recent divorce and how her relationship with Harris began. In the essay, Bush wrote that she hated the idea of ""having to come out in 2024"" but thought it was important with the increase of legislation against the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.  ""I think I've always known that my sexuality exists on a spectrum,"" Bush wrote. ""Right now I think the word that best defines it is queer. I can't say it without smiling, actually. And that feels pretty great."" Bush added later that coming out publicly was a weight off her shoulders. ""I finally feel like I can breathe. I don't think I can explain how profound that is,"" Bush said. ""I can feel my legs and feet. I can feel my feet in my shoes right now. It makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time."" In the essay, Bush said she caught feelings for Harris after they supported each other during their respective divorce proceedings. She also said she was hurt when people began criticizing the relationship. ""It's painful to be doing deep work and have it picked apart by clueless strangers,"" Bush said. ""Just because I didn't want to process my realizations in real time on social media and spell them out for the world doesn't mean the journey wasn't long and thoughtful and exhaustive."" For years, Reneé Rapp has identified as bisexual. However, in the early months of 2024, she began to identify as a lesbian. In January, she said on Andy Cohen's SiriusXM radio show: ""I don't think I like boys."" Later that month, when she appeared in a sketch on ""Saturday Night Live,"" she was referred to as a ""little lesbian intern."" In February, she told The Hollywood Reporter that she is a lesbian. She said her journey with her sexuality was similar to that of her ""Sex Lives of College Girls"" character, Leighton Murray. ""It is so interesting that at the time I wasn't even aware that what I was experiencing in my own personal life was actually exactly what I was doing onscreen,"" Rapp said. ""I was in a relationship with a man, incredibly confused, unsure of myself, feeling so insecure in my acting."" Rapp added later that she had only recently started referring to herself as a lesbian. ""I've only recently been in a relationship where I'm like, 'Yeah, I'm a lesbian for sure,'"" she said. ""It's also been the most rewarding, validating, scary, and exciting experience ever."" In June, Rapp told Them that she was nervous about publicly coming out on ""Saturday Night Live"" because some of her friends responded negatively.  ""I stayed off my phone for a couple days because I was so fucking terrified and felt so shitty but then it was just, like, a thing, and it felt good,"" Rapp said of what she did after appearing on ""SNL."" In January, PinkNews reported that ""Ru Paul's Drag Race"" season four contestant Madame LaQueer came out a trans on her Instagram story and changed her stage name to Madame Cassandra Uzumaki LaQueer. A day later, LaQueer told Entertainment Weekly that she spontaneously decided to come out after liking how she looked in the mirror after trimming her eyebrows. She said that she realized she was trans in 2006 but had struggled to come to terms with it and experience a ""12-year long depression."" LaQuuer said she eventually decided to accept her trans identity after having a conversation with Jade Jolie, another ""Drag Race"" contestant who came out in October 2023. ""It came out in the conversation, and she knew everything I was going to say. She clocked it quickly, and it just made sense. Like, girl, it's now or never,"" LaQueer said. LaQueer added that she hoped coming out would help others who have struggled to accept their identity. ""It's never too late to come out and live your true experience and be yourself and be authentic. There's nothing like feeling loved in your own skin,"" she said. A week later, another ""Ru Paul's Drag Race"" star came out as trans. Amanda Tori Meating, who starred in the most recent season of ""Drag Race,"" told Entertainment Weekly's ""Quick Drag"" podcast that appearing on the reality show earlier this year helped her figure out her gender identity. She identified as nonbinary for four years before appearing on ""Drag Race,"" but she said it didn't feel right. Meating said when she started to consider that she was trans, her former husband was not OK with it, partly causing their divorce.  ""It wasn't at all supported by my partner, and it ended up being a big part of why I had to leave, because he didn't want to be with a trans person,"" Meating said. ""I was in a bad place about it, mentally, for a while, but you get to a point where you're like, I have to do what's right for me, and that involved getting out of that."" Meating added that hearing people calling her Amanda or using she/her pronouns for her made her feel ""a bit more comfortable in the reformation of my identity."" ""That experience helped push me out of the nest a little bit and crack the egg,"" she said, adding that she refers to herself as a ""t-girl"" because she doesn't feel ready to call herself a transwoman. ""House of the Dragon"" star Bethany Antonia came out as gay while responding to racist trolls. Multiple media outlets reported in late April that Antonia shared a racist DM she had received on her Instagram story. ""'N**** you look like a piece of shit,"" the message read. ""It's a miracle they even included you in the trailer. But we don't care. I hope you accidentally die on set."" Below the DM, Antonia captioned the post: ""Wait till they find out I'm gay too."" Many fans shared posts supporting Antonia after the story went viral. Bruce Joel Rubin, the 81-year-old screenwriter behind ""Ghost,"" came out as gay while promoting his memoir ""It's Only a Movie."" Rubin told The Guardian in May that he's known he is gay since childhood. Rubin said he had told his wife, Blanche, and children long before he came out. ""I don't like that I was closeted for so long but it would just have confused people,"" Rubin said, before adding. ""I didn't want to leave this world with any secrets.'"" Rubin said he told his wife Blanche that he was gay when they first met but that he enjoyed sex with women. Rubin said Blanche did not mind, and they married two years later. ""Clearly, I held back my sexuality. My sexual life was always very internalized. Of course, one wants orgasmic life, but I had orgasms with Blanche. She and I had a good sex life,"" Rubin said. He added: ""And I'll tell you something you'll find out: when you hit your 80s and you think your libido is gone, it comes flying back. So big! Male beauty for me is overwhelmingly powerful. Just seeing someone in the supermarket, I feel this explosive joy."" ""Dancing On Ice"" UK star Colin Grafton came out during an interview with PinkNews in February. Grafton, who is a former US Olympic skater, told PinkNews that he has never hidden his sexuality but has never felt the need to announce it. ""I told my closest friends, I told the people around me and I eventually told my parents. I was maybe 24 when all that happened,"" Grafton said. ""I know there's a lot of curiosity about my sexual orientation and my love life, but I never actually came out to the public."" He added: ""If I'm honest, I never really felt the need to announce it before but the reason I am saying this now is because I want to show that there is representation in any way I can."" In February, actor Zoe Lister-Jones came out as queer while on the 2024 Film Independent Spirit Awards red carpet alongside her new partner Sammi Cohen, the director of ""You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah."" ""I'm here, I'm queer, I have some fear but I'm working through it,"" Lister-Jones told The Hollywood Reporter. Lister-Jones also praised the Spirit Awards for having genderless award categories. ""All award shows should follow in their footsteps and make categories genderless,"" she said. ""I'm dating a nonbinary person. I'm friends with so many nonbinary people. And I think that without really shifting the paradigm in a larger way, it's closing a lot of doors for really important voices."" Grace Wilson was Australia's first professional football player to come out as nonbinary. Wilson, a goalkeeper for Adelaide United and Young Matildas, spoke to Holly Ransom, Australia's Pride Cup chair, about their gender identity in a video published on Adelaide United's YouTube page on March 1. In the video, Wilson said they realized they were nonbinary in 2022 after shaving their hair for charity. Later in the video, Wilson said they decided to reveal their gender identity because they wanted people to refer to them in the way they were comfortable with. ""I didn't really realize kind of how angry I was getting at people for when they were misgendering me and they didn't know because I didn't tell them,"" Wilson said. They added: ""So I've decided that I can't live like that anymore. I want to be fully myself. I want to fully embrace this, and I want other people to be able to refer to me in ways that I'm comfortable with."" In late March, Matt Terry, the winner of ""X Factor"" UK season 13, said he is part of the LGBTQ+ community in an interview with Gay Times to promote a new song. The new song, ""His Car,"" was about Terry's previous relationship with a man and how he kept their romance a secret. ""I said to him, 'You're not allowed to tell anyone about this' and he loved me enough to do so,"" Terry said. ""Six, seven, years later, I realize that's not something we should be doing, and it's not something you should ask somebody. It's such a regret of mine, and I'm just really sorry."" In 2016, while Terry was competing in ""X Factor"" UK, multiple tabloids began speculating about his sexuality. Terry said this period was ""fucking hard"" because he hadn't come out yet to his friends or family. ""The press, and people around me in the music industry, were asking me for an answer I could've give, because it wasn't an area I'd explored yet. I'd never been with a man at this point,"" Terry added, saying this made him step back from the industry for a few years. Terry said he is currently in a relationship with a man and is ""very proud"" of his sexuality. A post shared by Outsports (@outsports) ""Baby Reindeer"" star Jessica Gunning publicly came out as ""a big old gay"" during an appearance on the ""Reign with Josh Smith"" podcast in June. Gunning said she came out to her parents in November 2022 after realizing she was gay at age 36. ""That was a mega, mega thing for me. I'm surrounded by gays, all my friends are gay, and so it wasn't that I was repressing anything,"" Gunning said. ""It was just that I didn't think I could be, and I still can't articulate it in the best way."" She added: ""But yeah, I realized I was a big old gay, and I was like, 'That's what it's been. That's what it is.' That was a massive moment where everything clicked, and I made sense for myself then."" Gunning said that realizing she was gay was ""the most liberating thing,"" and she slept well after telling her parents. https://t.co/i7WPptfF7a pic.twitter.com/aBeLqbLTCA On Sunday, Maren Morris, a Grammy-winning country singer, came out as bisexual in an Instagram post. ""Happy to be the B in LGBTQ+,"" Morris captioned a slideshow of pictures from her sold-out concert in Phoenix. Deshawn Radden came out as queer on June 10 when he appeared on the ""Survivor""-focused podcast, ""The Pride has Spoken."" On the podcast, Radden, the runner-up in ""Survivor"" season 41, was interviewed by one of his costars Evvie Jagoda, who identifies as queer and nonbinary/transmasc. Radden told Jagoda that they taught them the term ""queer,"" and Radden realized this term fit him more than straight or gay. ""You spoke power into the word because when I was growing up, queer was a very derogatory term for people,"" Radden said. ""So just watching you and you owning your title as you know a queer person was very, very influential to me."" Radden said he came out to his family in 2021 at age 25 but was unsure whether he should make a public statement, so he didn't bring it up while on ""Survivor."" Radden said he first realized he was different when he was four or five but was constantly told that being gay or acting like a woman was bad. He added that before he realized he was queer, he felt a lot of ""anguish almost every single day"" and turned to ""substance abuse"" to cope. Later the same day, Radden said he was a ""queer black man"" in an Instagram post. ""As of today, I look to do 2 things: 1. No longer live in duality, but in truth & oneness 2. Be an example that God loves each of us and can/will use anyone,"" Radden wrote. ""To anyone who may struggle reconciling parts of your identity with your faith, this is my advice: Experience God, on your own, through genuine relationship and see what happens. Love!""

80,Julia Pugachevsky,Bethenny Frankel said red flags become 'fire engine-red' during divorce. Here are her biggest ones to watch out for when you start dating.,https://www.businessinsider.com/bethenny-frankel-dating-red-flags-bad-divorce-2024-6,Bethenny Frankel started a new YouTube series chronicling her divorce experience. Here are the dating red flags she warns about.,2024-06-12T21:01:40Z,"In 2010, Bravo aired ""Bethenny Getting Married,"" a one-season reality show documenting Bethenny Frankel's relationship with pharmaceutical sales executive Jason Hoppy. The marriage lasted two years, and the couple had one child, Bryn Hoppy. The divorce took nearly a decade, finalizing in 2021 after Frankel filed for divorce in 2013. The lengthy process prompted Frankel to create ""JUST B DIVORCE,"" a new YouTube series where the former reality star and business leader shares her insights for women both pre- and mid-divorce. ""It was a brutal, brutal experience,"" Frankel, 53, told Business Insider. ""I thought I would never survive it."" While Frankel shares practical divorce tips on the show, she also emphasizes the importance of spotting red flags early on. ""You can't marry someone that you wouldn't want to be divorced from,"" Frankel told BI. ""The red flags that you see in dating will become fire engine-red flags when you're getting divorced."" She said people can get ""vengeful"" throughout the process, especially when navigating custody battles. Frankel shared some of her biggest dating red flags to watch out for early on in a relationship. Frankel told BI that ""charming"" men should set off alarm bells. She spoke more about the red flag in her series, stating that her life coach told her to run if charm is someone's primary personality trait. ""You don't own charm, charm owns you,"" she quoted the coach. Excessive charm is associated with narcissists and dark empaths, who use it to manipulate the people around them, according to therapists. Lois M. Brenner, a divorce lawyer in New York, previously told Business Insider that she's had many clients say they were love-bombed and had ""no idea who this person was"" when they married them because of how charming they were at first. In April, TikToker Megan Boni shared a sound bite designed to be remixed: ""I'm looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6'5"", blue eyes."" It went viral, with David Guetta releasing his own version of the song. While the song is a joke, Frankel still warned against going after trust fund guys in particular. ""You don't want a trust fund guy because of the way that they're going to ultimately treat you and discard you,"" she told BI. She believes that they will get bored and toss you aside because ""they're insecure and they've been given everything."" Immaturity is another quality Frankel said to stay away from, because it can indicate how a partner handles disagreement. She stressed the importance of being with someone who's emotionally mature. ""You don't want to date boys, you want to date men,"" she told BI, adding that physical age means nothing. ""A 65-year-old man could be a boy. A 25-year-old boy could be a man."" On TikTok, Frankel advised viewers to put men they're dating ""through a strainer"" and be really discerning. ""If it's giving boy, it's giving 'bye,'"" she said. Frankel said ""cracks become craters"" once you're married, so it's important to listen to your reservations. ""If you don't have a resounding, emphatic 'yes,' the answer is 'no,'"" she told BI. She added that someone's fears and expectations might make them feel obligated to go through with a marriage, such as their parents liking the person or feeling like they need to hit a certain milestone by a certain age. But none of that means you're ready to marry the person, and the consequences can be dire. ""You have to make smart decisions, and hopefully other people can learn from so many of my mistakes,"" Frankel said. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

81,Loreta Parapijankaite,"I grew up in Lithuania, the happiest place in the world for people under 30. It really is Europe's biggest hidden gem.",https://www.businessinsider.com/why-lithuania-happiest-country-young-people-from-local-2024-6,"World Happiness Report named Lithuania the happiest place in the world for young people. Growing up in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, I can see why.",2024-06-12T14:28:01Z,"Although often overlooked in favor of its larger European neighbors, Lithuania has emerged as a top destination for young people seeking a higher quality of life. The Baltic gem is truly Europe's biggest hidden treasure, and the secret might be out: The World Happiness Report 2024 just dubbed it the happiest place in the world for children and people under 30. As someone who was born and raised in Lithuania's capital city, Vilnius, I can attest to the country's unique appeal and why it stands out as an ideal place for the younger generation. For starters, Lithuania offers free university education to a large portion of its population — by comparison, a university education can leave graduates in six figures of debt in places like the US. Plus, Lithuania has some of the cheapest rent in Europe. Although I moved out of Vilnius 10 years ago to pursue career opportunities in London, I visit home often. My most recent visit to Lithuania lasted nearly a month and only reaffirmed my love for the country and its capital. Vilnius is not only beautiful but also incredibly walkable and easy to navigate. It's so compact that you can easily get around on foot or by bike, which can be rented for just a few euros. As you wander through the streets, you'll discover a diverse array of art, culture, and nature, with numerous historic monuments in the heart of the city. One standout is Gediminas' Castle Tower, a historic fortress on top of the hill in the middle of the old town. From its vantage point, you can take in a breathtaking, panoramic skyline view of red roofs stretching as far as the eye can see. We're really proud of our red roofs in the old town — and even have a song about it! Streets are lined with local shops selling unique souvenirs, adding to the city's charming and inviting atmosphere. People here are proud of their culture, and I often see local grandmas selling handmade amber jewelry. Many locals believe amber has healing powers, and it's popular to wear it around here. The culture is rich, too. During my last visit, I stumbled upon a street festival where local bands and musicians performed live music around the city. Vilnius's culinary scene is vibrant, with a wide variety of dining options, from traditional Lithuanian dishes to international cuisine. Local favorites like cepelinai (potato dumplings) and šaltibarščiai (cold beetroot soup) are not to be missed. Lithuania's nightlife scene is also diverse, catering to a wide range of tastes and preferences. Whether you're into techno clubs or laid-back jazz bars, there's always something happening in the city after dark. The bars, clubs, and social venues in Vilnius are always buzzing with energy. In the summer, numerous outdoor spaces are created to host all sorts of events, further adding to the area's lively atmosphere. I miss these spaces a lot and have yet to find something like this in London, even though it's a major city. As someone who has seen both the fast-paced life of London and the charming tranquility of Vilnius, I can confidently say that Lithuania is a place where the young can truly thrive. I love its wonderful sense of community and frequently find myself longing for the charm and tranquility of my homeland — especially when flights from London to Vilnius sometimes get as cheap as a few pounds.

82,Grace Eliza Goodwin,Top US diplomat says Hamas is moving the goalposts on a cease-fire,https://www.businessinsider.com/antony-blinken-hamas-negotiations-new-demands-cease-fire-2024-6,"Antony Blinken says Hamas wants to make changes to a proposed ceasefire deal, complicating peace efforts as the 8-month-long war continues.",2024-06-12T17:19:01Z,"The US-led plan for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has hit another stumbling block — and the US says Hamas is to blame. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the militant group has made new demands, moving the goalposts on a proposed cease-fire to end the 8-month-long war. Blinken told reporters from Doha on Wednesday that Hamas has not agreed to a US-backed ceasefire proposal because it wants to make ""numerous changes,"" despite the deal being ""virtually identical"" to one Hamas had previously accepted. Blinken said Israel has already accepted the deal, and that while ""Hamas could have answered with a single word: yes,"" it has not. ""Instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks and then proposed more changes, a number of which go beyond positions it had previously taken and accepted,"" Blinken continued. Blinken did not specify what aspects of the deal Hamas wanted to change, but a source familiar with the matter told CNN that Hamas's response, which was submitted to Qatari mediators, includes establishing a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and for Israel to completely withdraw its forces from Gaza. ""Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,"" Blinken said. Blinken added that because the negotiations have gone on for so long and Hamas keeps changing its demands, he is beginning ""to question whether they're proceeding in good faith or not."" Hamas had previously agreed to another deal, proposed by mediators Egypt and Qatar, that included a permanent ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, as well as a release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that deal, saying it was ""very far"" from Israel's central demands. Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, a mediator who spoke to reporters alongside Blinken, said that on different occasions, the behavior from both Israel and Hamas has been ""counterproductive to the efforts."" Blinken said the US and mediators will work with Hamas in the coming days to resolve its issues as best as possible and close the deal. ""The longer this goes on, the more people will suffer, and it's time for the haggling to stop and the cease-fire to start,"" Blinken said. ""It's as simple as that."" Palestinian health authorities have said Israeli forces have killed over 37,000 people in Gaza since the war began in October when Hamas launched terrorist attacks across the Israeli border, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking more than a hundred hostages.

83,Tim Paradis,The forces reshaping our jobs are coming faster than ever,https://www.businessinsider.com/workforce-innovation-series-c-suite-worker-well-being-dei-2024-6,"Business Insider's ""Workforce Innovation"" series covers artificial intelligence, the C-suite, worker well-being, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.",2024-06-12T19:08:00Z,"This article is part of ""Workforce Innovation,"" a series exploring the trends and leaders shaping enterprise transformation. Work doesn't work like it used to. Remote and hybrid work setups are standard — and likely here to stay. Generative artificial intelligence is making its way into many offices, bringing opportunities but also concerns that, as these bots get better, demand for workers might drop. In the C-suite, the rise of roles like chief digital officer and chief data officer reflects the need for diverse skills, from digital transformation to employee wellness and sustainability. Meanwhile, many employers are paying more attention to how employees are feeling. Some leaders are openly discussing mental-health challenges and ways to manage stress and fight burnout. And despite political pushback against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, many young people entering the workforce say they care about DEI. Business Insider's ""Workforce Innovation"" series will explore how our jobs are changing by digging into four themes: AI, the changing C-suite, worker well-being, and DEI. As part of the series, we're also convening a Workforce Innovation Board, which will be announced in August. The board will be composed of C-suite leaders from HR, strategy, technology, and DEI. The Board will convene regularly to share insights on the forces driving innovation where we work. Artificial intelligence will be a job killer. AI will become your digital assistant. AI will take over everything. The variety of predictions about what AI will mean for the workplace — and beyond — is wide. And while it's too early to say with certainty how the technology will remake our 9-to-5s, many experts say there will be big changes. AI could help train workers. And it could help weaker performers get better at their jobs. It could help boost overall productivity. As a result, companies are fighting for workers who can develop AI models. Daron Acemoglu, an institute professor in the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told BI he agreed with the notion that AI could represent one of the biggest changes since the rise of the internet. Yet he said it's unclear how reliable the technology would be at doing parts of — or all of — people's jobs. Acemoglu said that some employers rushing to swap people for bots might realize that some AI tools lack the versatility of humans. ""These models have very limited capabilities,"" he said. ""So if you adopt them too quickly and without enough thought, you might actually not get anything like the productivity boosts that you were expecting."" Acemoglu said it's likely some workers — particularly at the high end of the pay scale — would have AI assistants to help them get more done. For others, especially office workers earning middle-class or lower-middle-class incomes, it's unknown how AI might help or hurt. ""Whether that person is ever going to have any type of help from AI or whether it's going to be his replacement being trained by AI, we'll have to see,"" he said. The C-suite is getting more crowded, and jobs like chief growth officer and chief AI officer are becoming more common. The rapid evolution of technology requires corporate leaders to elevate more players to the C-suite to help manage it all, according to Ty Wiggins, the global lead of the CEO- and executive-transitions practice at the recruiting firm Russell Reynolds Associates. Increasing amounts of data and the emergence of AI, Wiggins told BI, require companies to have roles beyond chief information officer or chief technology officer. It wasn't long ago, he said, that tech functions might have simply fallen under a chief operating officer or a chief financial officer. Corporate chiefs now need to have closer connections to different aspects of the business — especially emerging ones like AI, Wiggins said. ""If that function is not reporting directly into you, you are two steps away from something that's moving so quickly that has a significant impact on the organization and your performance as CEO,"" he said. Wiggins, the author of ""The New CEO,"" said the C-suite continues to shift away from a place focused on reporting about various aspects of a company to becoming the ""top team"" tasked with helping the CEO solve the biggest problems facing an organization. ""The C-suite is no longer just a reporting body,"" he said. It's not enough for CFOs to pump out financial reports or the head of human resources to lobby for increased hiring, Wiggins said. ""There is an enormous pressure now on C-suite executives to really move from being a technical expert to a technical leader of other experts and to join the C-suite in a way that means that they can contribute to the other functions,"" he added. The well-being of workers has drawn greater attention since the pandemic. Many employees report feeling stressed out. And various mental-health challenges are hitting workers — and businesses, as a result. Depression and anxiety alone sap the global economy of an estimated 12 billion productive workdays each year, the World Health Organization says, adding that the annual cost of that reduced output totals almost $1 trillion. Carly Holm, the founder and CEO of Humani HR, a consulting firm, told BI that challenges around workers' mental health are bigger than ever. Yet, as the problems grow, more companies are looking at narrower interventions over a one-size-fits-all program, like offering counseling services that not everyone will want to use. ""A gym membership may be great for some people, but other people may not be interested in going to a gym,"" she said. A better approach, Holm said, is talking to employees about their needs. Often, this involves something that's not expensive or even difficult to implement, such as flexible work schedules. Or it could involve offering wellness days in addition to vacation days. Business leaders often consider extra days off a major expense, she added. But that extra time away, Holm said, is correlated with improved productivity and business performance. ""Having that flexible workplace so that people can kind of merge life and work, I think, really goes a long way,"" she said. Employers also can adjust policies that might not be working, Holm said. Unlimited paid time off sounds great, but if workers don't use it, they lose the chance to recover. Instead, she said, setting a minimum PTO might be a better approach. Some employers, Holm said, are telling workers they need to take a week or two in a row — and not just a day or two here and there. ""They see the value and getting their employees to unplug,"" she said. ""The data is clear: When your employees are healthy, when they are happy, they're going to work better,"" Holm said. DEI feels like a buzzword gone bad. Companies that a few years ago were happy to talk about their efforts to make their workplaces more equitable are now far less likely to mention DEI in quarterly earnings calls. Some companies have also been cutting DEI jobs. It's a notable about-face. DEI initiatives rose toward the top of many corporate to-do lists after George Floyd's murder in 2020 and the racial reckoning that followed. Between 2020 and 2021, the role of chief diversity officer was the fastest-growing title in the C-suite. But by 2022, hiring started to slip for such jobs, according to LinkedIn data. In the years since, DEI has become a political wedge. ""There's a clear backlash right now,"" Regina Lawless, the former head of DEI at Instagram and author of ""Do You,"" told BI. She said companies would have to choose how they want to continue to do this work. Lawless said companies were right to ask about the impact of their DEI efforts because some initial steps, like creating coursework on race, could amount to little more than papering over a problem. ""A lot of companies just went at it in a performative way,"" she said. ""We just throw in an employee resource group and think that's going to solve the very real issues of people from different backgrounds not having equitable experiences in the workplace."" Lawless said that as Gen Z took on a larger role in the workplace — they're expected to outnumber boomers among full-time US workers in 2024 — employers would have to be more thoughtful about addressing DEI. That's what many young workers are expecting, she said. To progress and move beyond performative measures, companies will need to look under the hoods of the systems they use to hire, develop, promote, retain, and pay workers, Lawless said. Some of these procedures are leading, even if unintentionally, to inequitable outcomes, she said. In other cases, some people in charge simply have undue power, Lawless added. ""When you give your managers too much discretion, and there aren't checks and balances, that's when bias has the opportunity to creep in,"" she said. Lawless added that managers needed training on inclusive leadership to get the most from diverse teams. To move forward, Lawless said, more employers will need to dig deeper into the data and ensure that DEI teams are not the only ones tasked with promoting equitable experiences within an organization. It will have to become a shared responsibility, she said. ""The future of DEI,"" Lawless said, ""does need to be more diffuse."" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

A State Department spokesperson told BBC on Tuesday that following a vetting of the brigade, there was ""no evidence of gross violations of human rights."" The group was established in 2014 as the Azov Battalion by a figure linked to far-right hate groups in Ukraine. The unit's members' alleged far-right ties led the US to bar the group from receiving assistance. Now known as the Azov Brigade, the unit became part of the Ukrainian National Guard in 2015. The unit sought to distance itself from its checkered past, yet it has also been banned from receiving US assistance for years, since the passing of a 2018 congressional spending bill. The State Department has dismissed the congressional ban and said the Azov Brigade ""passed Leahy vetting,"" referring to Leahy Law, which prevents the US from supporting foreign entities that have committed major human rights violations. ""Understanding by our allies how important it is to help each of these units is another important step on the way of our struggle for independence,"" Ukrainian National Guard spokesperson Ruslan Muzychuk told The Washington Post following the State Department announcement. The Kremlin has used the Azov Brigade as a talking point in justifying Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as President Vladimir Putin has previously stated that his objectives of the war include the ""demilitarization and de-Nazification of Ukraine."" The Azov Brigade has claimed that it has evolved from its problematic past and that its leadership has changed since its inception. In a response to the decision on Instagram, the unit wrote that ""obtaining Western weapons and training from the United States will not only increase the combat ability of Azov, but most importantly, contribute to the preservation of the lives and the health of personnel."" ""This is a new page in our unit's history,"" the brigade said, adding that ""Azov is becoming even more powerful, even more professional and even more dangerous for occupiers."" The brigade is closely associated with its significant, albeit costly, defense of Mariupol in 2022 at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, where it was eventually forced to surrender its fight from the Azovstal steel mill. The unit's soldiers have been celebrated as heroes and symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Here's Honda's latest: a $15,500 miniature truck.",https://www.businessinsider.com/honda-15500-tiny-electric-truck-japan-photos-look-inside-2024-6,"Honda is getting into the tiny EV game with the N-VAN e, a miniature electric truck that starts at 2.44 million yen ($15,500).",2024-06-14T12:14:24Z,"Japan is famous for its tiny vehicles, known as Kei cars, which are well suited for navigating the narrow streets of crowded cities like Tokyo. The country's best-selling electric vehicle last year was the Nissan Sakura, a $13,000 electric Kei car that outsold EV giants like Tesla, according to data from auto industry groups compiled by Bloomberg. Now, Honda is getting into the tiny EV game. The Japanese automaker has unveiled the N-VAN e, a miniature electric truck that starts at 2.44 million yen ($15,500). It comes as Japan lags behind the rest of the world in transitioning to EVs. Just 2.2% of new passenger cars sold in Japan in 2023 were electric, according to data from industry bodies, compared to 25% in EV pace-setter China, per Nikkei. Honda's electric truck will be targeted at delivery and construction companies rather than ordinary consumers. The company is already trialing the pocket-sized truck with logistic firm Yamato. The EV will have a range of 152 miles and will be able to charge in 30 minutes with fast charging, Honda says. Honda has also attempted to solve the issues EVs have in hot and cold temperatures, installing a battery cooling and heating system to ensure it remains at a stable temperature. The company says the N-VAN e will also function as a mobile power storage device, with drivers able to use the truck's external power outlet to charge household appliances such as hot plates and electric kettles. The N-Van can seat between one and four people, depending on which style the buyer selects; each option varies in price. The truck is expected to launch in Japan in October. Separately, Honda announced it would establish a new company in partnership with fellow Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi. The new joint venture, Altna, will aim to lower the cost of electric vehicles and extend the lifetime of EV batteries. Like other Japanese automakers, Honda was slow to get into the EV game. However, it is now racing to electrify, investing $11 billion in a Canadian EV hub and pledging to have 80% of its vehicle lineup be EVs by 2035 and 100% by 2040.

87,Nora Naughton,"Ford will no longer require dealers to invest $500,000+ just to sell EVs",https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ev-dealer-certification-plan-backfires-2024-6,Ford is ending a controversial dealership program that required investments of up to $1 million to fund EV chargers and training.,2024-06-13T15:41:28Z,"Ford dealers no longer need to invest up to $1 million in order to sell electric vehicles. The Blue Oval is ending its controversial EV dealership program less than two years after it was first announced, Ford Chief Operating Officer Marin Gjaja told reporters Thursday, according to CNBC. Ford dealers will no longer be required to invest in certification to get EVs on their lot, opening battery-electric sales to Ford's entire dealership network — a move Gjaja said is designed to grow Ford's EV sales. The program, first announced in September 2022, asked dealers to spend between $500,000 and $1.2 million to become ""EV Certified."" The steep price included expensive DC fast-chargers for dealer lots to double as charging locations and EV training for staff. This rigorous buy-in program was built on optimistic EV sales forecasts that dealers would make back their investments as electric-car popularity increased. But a lot has changed in the US EV market since the fall of 2022, and growth in the segment hasn't played out as Ford initially expected, Gjaja said. EV sales have slowed down in the past year. They are still on the rise but at a slower rate than the boom in growth that happened between 2020 and 2022. With wealthy early adopters largely sated, car companies are now trying to entice a new group of EV shoppers who are more frugal and practical. Ford dealers were among the first to raise alarm bells about this slowdown when some stores started turning down Mustang Mach-E allocations last summer. Later, dealers started reporting issues with F-150 Lightning demand — further eroding Ford's relationship with its dealers. Since then, Ford and other major automakers have gone back to the drawing board on their EV strategies. Even before this slowdown in EV sales, many Ford dealers were unhappy with the high price of entry for selling electric cars. Several dealer associations filed lawsuits related to the program. In one case, an Illinois board ruled in favor of the dealers' claim that Ford's EV certification program violated state laws. As of December of last year, a little more than half of Ford's nearly 3,000 US dealers had opted out of the EV investment requirements, an early sign that the program had backfired. Ford's dealers will still need to make some investments to support EV sales on their lots, but they will no longer be held to the minimum $500,000 investment.

88,Ayelet Sheffey,Some student-loan borrowers will soon get cheaper monthly payments through Biden's new repayment plan — but their accounts might be paused in the meantime,https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-payments-put-on-forbearance-borrowers-save-plan-bills-2024-6,The Education Department is placing some student-loan borrowers on the SAVE plan on forbearance as it recalculates their lower monthly payments.,2024-06-13T16:54:22Z,"Some student-loan borrowers are set to get cheaper bills next month — but the Education Department is still working on those new calculations. Last summer, President Joe Biden's Education Department launched the SAVE plan — a new student-loan repayment plan intended to make payments more affordable for borrowers with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness than prior income-driven repayment plans. The department already started rolling out some of SAVE's provisions ahead of schedule, including loan forgiveness for borrowers with original balances of $12,000 or less who made as few as 10 years of qualifying payments. Beginning in July, a host of new provisions are expected to be implemented. One of those provisions will allow borrowers with undergraduate student loans to have their payments capped at 5% of their discretionary income, which is down from the current 10% cap. However, as The New York Times first reported, the Education Department is still working through those new calculations and is placing impacted borrowers on administrative forbearance — during which they are not required to make payments and interest will not accrue — as it works toward implementing this new part of SAVE. Education Department spokesperson Vanessa Harmoush confirmed the forbearances, telling Business Insider that as the department finalizes the new SAVE payments, ""some borrowers may be placed in a brief processing forbearance to ensure they can access the full benefits of the SAVE Plan and that their new payment amounts are accurate."" ""While borrowers are in this specific forbearance, no payment is required, their interest rate will be set to 0%, and they will receive credit toward IDR forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF),"" she said. A department spokesperson added that the department ""has already sent servicers the information they need for hundreds of thousands of borrowers, some of which should see updated billing statements for July,"" and that 4.6 million borrowers who have $0 payments under SAVE will not need to enter forbearance. Given that borrowers typically receive bills for their student-loan payments a few weeks before the due date, this forbearance period will ensure that borrowers do not make a larger payment than necessary before the Education Department has time to calculate the new amounts. Aside from SAVE's implementation, the student-loan servicing industry is undergoing a series of changes that are impacting borrowers' user experience. For example, the Education Department is transitioning the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program away from servicer MOHELA and is instead splitting up PSLF accounts among other servicers to be overseen by Federal Student Aid. The Education Department is also working toward implementing its new student-loan forgiveness plan after the Supreme Court struck the first one down last summer, and it is continuing to carry out its one-time account adjustments for borrowers on PSLF and income-driven repayment plans, expected to be completed in September.

89,Aditi Bharade,The COVID-19 infection you caught at a Taylor Swift concert is not a gift from 'Mother',https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-fans-calling-covid-19-infection-souvenir-2024-6,"In an informal poll on X after the Eras Tour's Madrid leg, over 3,700 people said they'd caught the virus.",2024-06-13T07:17:59Z,"It's been years since the pandemic times of COVID-19 lockdowns and the era of mandated masking. But while the virus is still circulating, some Swifties have become wildly optimistic about what it means to catch an infection at one of their idol's concerts.  So much so that some Swifties on social media are playfully dubbing the COVID-19 infection they think they got from her concerts a ""souvenir"" and a ""gift"" from ""Mother."" A post on X from a Spanish Taylor Swift fan account asked followers: ""Did you go to #MadridTStheErasTour and take COVID, a virus, or a cold with you as a souvenir? I open a survey."" ¿Fuiste al #MadridTStheErasTour y te llevaste de recuerdo covid, algún virus o algún resfriado? Abro encuestita: Of the nearly 10,800 votes, 35% voted yes. People in the poll's comments section described their symptoms and showed their positive COVID-19 tests — but also raved about how they thought it was worth it.  The poll has been viewed nearly 144,000 times at press time. One X user commented: ""Going to Taylor's concert has meant losing my voice, losing my mental health and, well, my health in general, I'm more dead than alive (but I would go to the concert a thousand more times)."" Earlier in February, an Australian concertgoer posted a TikTok of herself dressed up in her concert outfit and glam makeup. The video then cut straight to her holding up a positive COVID-19 test kit in bed. She captioned the post: ""The Eras Tour souvenir no ones talking about. if youre heading to the sydney shows this weekend, wash your hands regularly!"" However, other X users have voiced their disbelief at Swifties calling the virus a souvenir. One X user wrote: ""Taylor Swift's concert attendees are calling their Covid infections 'souvenirs' and 'gifts' from 'Mother,' and I'm supposed to NOT wanna launch myself into the sun???"" Concerts have gained notoriety as COVID-19 superspreader events. In 2021, over 2,200 people caught the virus after going to music festivals in northeast Spain. And while the virus is treated more like the common flu now, COVID-19 is still circulating — and people are getting infected across the US. Virus-spreading or not, Swift's Eras Tour has been widely successful, propelling the singer-songwriter to billionaire status. Swift is now in the UK for her next leg of the tour.

The suit, filed in California, notes employees wrote an open letter to SpaceX management about their concerns. Musk then personally ordered their terminations, the suit alleges. The complaint alleges Musk ""runs his company in the dark ages — treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the 'Animal House' environment that if they don't like it they can seek employment elsewhere."" The lawsuit accuses Musk and other upper management of appearing in a video that made light of sexual misconduct, which was screened at an employee holiday party. One scene shows VP of human resources Brian Bjelde ""having an employee demonstrate how to spank him in the 'correct' manner,"" according to the suit. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. ""Filing this suit marks an important milestone in our quest for justice, for holding leadership accountable, and for implementing responsible changes in workplace policies,"" one of the plaintiffs, Paige Holland-Thielen, said in a statement. The lawsuit accuses SpaceX of creating a hostile work environment, retaliation, failure to prevent harassment, gender discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and wrongful termination. The same group of former SpaceX employee previously filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging they were targeted for retaliation. But that case has been tied up after SpaceX sued the agency and said its enforcement processes violated the US Constitution. In May, an appeals court granted Musk's firm a temporary block that keeps the NLRB from pursuing its case. Separately, the Wall Street Journal published a report on Wednesday alleging Musk had inappropriate interactions with female SpaceX employees, including a sexual relationship with a former intern. The refreshed allegations of sexual misconduct come at a complicated time for Musk. On Thursday, Tesla shareholders will vote on Musk's contentious $55 billion pay package, potentially handing the billionaire a massive boost in wealth.

91,Lloyd Lee,"Ye seems to hate stairs so much that he tried to dismantle the ones inside the now-gutted, $39 million Malibu home by architect Tadao Ando",https://www.businessinsider.com/ye-kanye-west-ramps-stairs-tadao-ando-malibu-home-2024-6,"Ye tried to replace the stairs inside the Malibu home designed by Tadao Ando with a ramp, The New Yorker Reported.",2024-06-13T01:39:52Z,"Ye's apparent bad blood with staircases appears to run so deep that the rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, tried to replace the stairs inside a rare Malibu home designed by a famed Japanese architect. For months, Ye has been trying to sell his beachfront property on Malibu Road in Southern California. The home — one of a handful of residential properties in the US designed by the iconic Japanese architect Tadao Ando — is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Tony Saxon. Saxon was the project manager Ye commissioned in 2021 to oversee the house's redesign. He is accusing the artist of putting him in dangerous working conditions and failing to pay his wages. Ye's attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Since he was hired, Saxon received a number of demands from Ye, including stripping the property of its windows, plumbing, and other amenities, according to the lawsuit. A video provided to The New Yorker shows Saxon's coworker smashing the home's glass balustrade with a hammer. Another request from Ye was to replace the home's concrete staircase with a ramp or a slide, Saxon told The New Yorker. Saxon had proposed to the artist a slide made of stainless steel while Bianca Censori, Ye's wife, sent her husband three renderings of a concrete ramp, according to The New Yorker. Ye has publicly shared his curious disdain for staircases. In a 2022 interview with Alo Yoga cofounder Danny Harris, Ye said he was ""really big on outlawing stairs"" and that all homes should be designed to cater to older adults. ""We can have up-ramp but not upstairs,"" he said. ""Everything should be designed like an old-folks home."" Ye's fraught view of stairs has even been mentioned in a lawsuit filed by former staff members of Donda Academy, Ye's secretive private school. The ex-employees alleged in the suit that Donda Academy students were not allowed to have class on the second floor because the artist was ""reportedly afraid of stairs."" The lawsuit accused Ye of seven labor code violations and discrimination. A trial is scheduled for April 2025. Despite the artist's vision for universally designed homes, The New Yorker's Ian Parker, who reported on Ye's Malibu home and visited the property, wrote that the ramps that Ye proposed ""appeared to be at least four times as steep as any allowed by the Americans with Disabilities Act."" Parker also wrote that the ramps ended near the edge of the home's terrace that lost its barrier or railings during the demolition process. ""Someone descending the ramp from the primary bedroom on, say, a skateboard, could expect to shoot off the edge and land some thirty feet below, on the beach,"" Parker wrote. Ye's incomplete work on the home has essentially made the home uninhabitable due to the lack of power and plumbing. The Malibu home was first listed last year with the Oppenheim Group real estate firm for $53 million. The asking price has since been reduced to $39 million. Jason Oppenheim of Oppenheim Group told The New Yorker that a full renovation would cost at least $5 million. A spokesperson for Oppenheim Group did not immediately return a request for comment.

92,Peter Kafka,Why is Netflix's video game boss leaving? And why is Netflix in video games?,https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-games-mike-verdu-leaving-strategy-2024-6,Netflix is replacing the head of its Netflix Games division. It's a sign that the streamer hasn't quite mastered the video game business.,2024-06-12T17:58:24Z,"Netflix owns streaming. Video games is another story. The company launched a games division in 2021, but so far, its strategy has been puzzling, and the results don't appear to be overwhelming. Which is perhaps why Mike Verdu, the games industry veteran hired to run its gaming division, is moving on to a new, as-yet-to-be-defined role. His replacement? Yet-to-be-announced. Gamesindustry.biz, which reported on Verdu's departure, wrangled this quote from him, which doesn't illuminate much: ""I am so proud of what we've accomplished, and excited to start a new team at Netflix on the cutting edge of game innovation. New technologies have always been key to creativity in games development and, as an entrepreneur at heart, this initiative is right in my happy place."" I asked Netflix for comment. A PR rep didn't have anything to add beyond that quote. But here's what we know now: Netflix launched its games unit three years ago as its first real departure from streaming movies and TV shows. The idea was to create its own version of Apple's Apple Arcade offering: free, easy-to-play games for your phone that didn't have ads and never asked users to pay up to buy additional levels or anything else. The logic, per then-CEO Reed Hastings: Netflix users also played a lot of video games. So why not give them video games on Netflix, too? And, sure, Netflix executives argued, they didn't have any competency in building, buying, and distributing games. But they didn't know anything about making their own TV shows when they started back in 2011, and things worked out pretty well for them in the long run. But it's never been clear why, exactly, Netflix's selection of casual games would add value for its customers, who can get that sort of thing in lots of places. And while Netflix has continued to say that games are important for them, there seems to be some debate about that internally: Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Netflix officials were interested in putting ads into the games or finding other ways to turn them into revenue. For the record: The games push is one of the duties assigned to current Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

93,"Mia Jankowicz,Sinéad Baker","One of Russia's allies says it is quitting Putin's rival to NATO, in the latest snub to the Kremlin",https://www.businessinsider.com/armenia-says-leaving-csto-russia-nato-rival-another-blow-putin-2024-6,"Amid fraying relations between Armenia and Russia, Armenia's PM announced a withdrawal from the CSTO, the Moscow-led 'NATO' of post-Soviet countries.",2024-06-13T12:15:45Z,"A key Russian ally said it's quitting the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a group widely considered to be President Vladimir Putin's answer to NATO. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who has repeatedly snubbed Russia, said in parliament Wednesday that he'd take his country out of the Moscow-led CSTO alliance, The Associated Press reported. Pashinyan said his government would decide later when to make the move, according to the AP. Experts previously told Business Insider that Putin founded the alliance — made up of Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — as a rival to NATO and that he wanted to project power by leading a multinational body, despite most of the members not having notable militaries or large economies. However, the plan seems to have backfired as tensions among the alliance have grown, especially since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Pashinyan's latest announcement is likely a huge blow to Putin. The prime minister told lawmakers: ""We will leave. We will decide when to leave. We won't come back. There is no other way."" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, said Thursday that Russia ""will continue to work with our Armenian friends"" to clarify their position, the state-controlled Russian news agency TASS reported. Peter Frankopan, an expert on Russian and Balkans history at Oxford University, told BI that while other CSTO countries would likely give a ""shrug of the shoulders,"" Moscow would ultimately have a stronger response. Moscow will likely see Armenia as trying ""to be too big for small boots — so no doubt there will be repercussions in order to show the downsides of daring to stand up to Russia,"" he said, adding: ""What those are, and when they play out, is a matter of guesswork."" In the immediate aftermath, Armenia's foreign minister denied Pashinyan said the country was withdrawing, in an apparent attempt to soften the diplomatic impact, the AP reported. Tensions have heightened between Russia and Armenia since Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which Pashinyan has refused to endorse on multiple occasions. Pashinyan said in June 2023 that his country was ""not Russia's ally in the war with Ukraine"" and that it felt trapped between Russia and the West. Relations between Russia and other CSTO members have also become more strained since the invasion, with countries seeing how caught up Russia is in Ukraine — leaving some worried about how protected they are if attacked, experts previously told BI. Pashinyan was also irked when Russian peacekeeping troops did not come to Armenia's aid last year when Azerbaijan attacked a separatist region that had been largely under the control of ethnic Armenians. He had previously called the CSTO response to the conflict ""depressing"" and ""hugely damaging to the CSTO's image both in our country and abroad."" Pashinyan raised that issue again on Wednesday, accusing unspecified CSTO countries of conspiring against Armenia in the conflict. ""It turned out that its members failed to fulfill their obligations under the treaty and planned the war against us alongside Azerbaijan,"" Pashinyan said, per the AP. Frankopan said the latest development may not end with Armenia leaving the CSTO if negotiations take place. ""Talking about withdrawal can give a chance to course-correct for all sides, so it might be that we are seeing a round of shadowboxing, rather than something more definitive,"" he said. But he added that an Armenian withdrawal would be ""a long time coming,"" given the country's escalating complaints about Russia's leadership of the alliance. Other recent Armenian snubs to Russia include the country joining the International Criminal Court in February, even though it has issued an arrest warrant for Putin. Armenia froze its CSTO membership in February but until Wednesday had not clarified its position. In June, at a meeting of CSTO member states' foreign ministers, Armenia was asked to clarify its membership status, with its foreign minister later saying only that he had ""excellent personal relations"" with the bloc's secretary-general.

94,Megan duBois,"I was one of the first to ride the Splash Mountain replacement at Disney World. After years of controversy, it's a whole new ride.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tianas-bayou-adventure-ride-magic-kingdom-disney-world-worth-it-2024-6,"Tiana's Bayou Adventure, which took the place of Splash Mountain at Magic Kingdom, opens June 28, but I got to preview the new water ride.",2024-06-14T14:13:01Z,"In 2020, Disney announced it would close the popular but controversial Splash Mountain at both Disney World and Disneyland. There was plenty of upset and backlash from fans of the classic ride. But its story was based on the 1946 movie ""Songs of the South,"" which has been criticized for featuring a racist representation of the American Old South. In its place, Disney created a new ""Princess and the Frog""-themed water ride called Tiana's Bayou Adventure, with the company's first Black princess front and center. I got a chance to ride the new Magic Kingdom attraction early as part of a media preview event ahead of its official opening on June 28. Here's what it's like. Before loading into the log-style ride vehicles, a large outdoor queue area snakes around a concrete plaza. This largely unshaded outdoor area can get very hot, so I'd bring a handheld fan or an umbrella during the summer months to help keep cool. Just before heading inside, I spotted Tiana's delivery truck decorated in Mardi Gras colors. After walking through the outdoor line, I reached the covered indoor section of the queue, which was almost cuter than the actual attraction. I loved all of the hidden details. But one of the first things I saw was a newspaper folded up on a wooden table. The headline read, ""Princess Tiana throws a Mardi Gras Party for all of New Orleans."" This was my first big clue for what to expect from the ride itself. Just past the table, on the shelf above the desk, there's a little Easter egg paying tribute to Splash Mountain: fox, bear, and bunny tchotchkes placed together as a nod to Brer Fox, Brer Bear, and Brer Rabbit. If you've ever watched ""The Princess and the Frog,"" you'll know that gumbo, a stew-like dish that's famous in New Orleans, is a big part of the story. I loved seeing a framed copy of Tiana's dad's famous recipe on the wall of the queue. I snapped a picture just to try out the recipe myself. Just past the gumbo recipe, I peeked into Tiana's kitchen, where a plate of beignets was covered in powdered sugar on the table.  It even smelled like powdered sugar inside the kitchen. The log-style ride vehicles for Tiana's Bayou Adventure looked very similar to the ones from Splash Mountain — I wouldn't be surprised if they just recycled the old ones. They each have four rows that can comfortably fit two adults each. I got a seat in the back row of the log. After the first lift hill, I got my first look at the impressive new animatronics that Disney created for the attraction, which is set a year after ""The Princess and the Frog"" ends. Princess Tiana welcomed us to the bayou and let us know what to bring to the party. The ride continued down into the bayou past Louis and Mama Odie from the movie. Throughout the ride, there were familiar songs from the movie. But there was also an all-new song called ""Special Spice,"" sung by Anika Noni Rose, who voiced Tiana. The most famous part of Splash Mountain was probably the big drop into the briar patch, and that track remained the same for the reimagined water ride. Luckily, in the back of the log, I didn't get very wet throughout the ride, including the big drop. My favorite part of the ride was the final scene, where all the characters gather for a big celebration.  Each of the critters we passed during the ride is now playing music for the party. One of my favorite details was seeing Gritty, the rabbit, playing the washboard, which is actually the license plate from Tiana's truck outside.  I only ended up riding Tiana's Bayou Adventure once during the preview event. Although it's not my favorite ride at Disney World (that spot belongs to Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind), it's great to have something new. I also loved everything the Disney creatives did to make the attraction feel like it was plucked right out of New Orleans. When Tiana's Bayou Adventure officially opens at the end of the month, Magic Kingdom will only offer a virtual queue, as has been the case for other recent rides. But you can also purchase Genie+ or an Individual Lighting Lane to ride. The minimum height requirement is 40 inches. The ride doesn't have scary story elements, but some parts are dark, and the big drop could be too much for younger kids.

95,Lakshmi Varanasi,McKinsey exec tells summer interns that learning to ask AI the right questions is the key to success,https://www.businessinsider.com/mckinsey-prompt-engineer-ai-right-questions-key-to-success-interns-2024-6,"If you want to be a star intern this summer, learn to use generative AI, a McKinsey executive says.",2024-06-14T13:11:01Z,"Standing out in a summer internship these days boils down to one thing — learning to talk to AI. At least, that's the advice McKinsey's chief client officer, Liz Hilton Segel, gave one eager intern at the firm. ""My advice to her was to be an outstanding prompt engineer,"" Hilton Segel told The Wall Street Journal.  McKinsey is among a handful of top consulting firms capitalizing on the generative AI frenzy. Its record $16 billion in revenue last year came, in part, from new work relating to the technology. The firm has also launched its own in-house generative AI tools, including Lilli, named after Lillian Dombrowski, the first woman employed by McKinsey in professional services.  Lilli's purpose is to aggregate the firm's knowledge and capabilities so that employees can spend more time engaging with clients, Erik Roth, a senior partner at McKinsey who oversaw Lili's development, said last year in a press release announcing the tool. Tools like Lilli allow employees to cut down on busy work if they learn to prompt — the process of eliciting information from these tools — and focus their skills on higher-value tasks. Roth said at the firm's media day last month that 72% of consultants now use Lilli. ""We've answered over 3 million prompts and add about 120,000 prompts per week,"" he said. ""We are saving on average up to 30% of a consultants' time that they can reallocate to spend more time with their clients instead of spending more time analyzing things.""

It cited the SpaceX employee's account to friends and family and emails she showed the outlet. Shotwell, SpaceX's chief operating officer, reportedly became suspicious of the woman after her husband enlisted her help to plan his wife's surprise 50th birthday party. The employee rang Robert Shotwell to arrange for him to collect boxes for the party from her house, which led to Gwynne Shotwell suspecting the pair of having an affair, the report said. Robert Shotwell sent the woman an email in November 2013 with the subject line ""Trouble,"" adding: ""She accused us of having an affair …Be prepared when she gets in."" The employee reportedly told a human resources executive about Shotwell's accusation, which later got back to the COO. The report said that Shotwell appeared to retaliate against the employee. Musk is the CEO of SpaceX. The woman told people close to her that she ended up in a tug-of-war between Shotwell and Musk. While Shotwell tried to push her out, Musk appeared to be trying to pull her in. The woman no longer works for SpaceX. SpaceX representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider made outside normal working hours. In response to the Journal's report, Musk's lawyers sent a sworn declaration from SpaceX's HR vice president stating he could not locate an HR complaint from the woman. Shotwell told the Journal in a statement that its report did not reflect SpaceX's culture. She did not respond to its questions about the employee's claims. The Journal's story also mentioned that a SpaceX employee who first met Musk when she was a summer intern had sex with him. Shotwell is regarded by some as the secret to the company's success. According to an org chart reported by The Information, the executive leads operations and oversees most teams and projects. Shotwell has 21 direct reports compared to Musk's four, and she oversees most of SpaceX's central business, including the teams working on Starlink, Falcon, and Starship.

However, some are better than others. Travel website The Points Guy published its annual list of the 10 best airlines in the US on Wednesday. It used 2023 data from airlines and the federal government to analyze four broad categories: reliability, experience, cost and reach, and loyalty. Delta Air Lines took the top spot for the sixth year in a row, followed by Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. This year, Delta carrier also earned titles from The Wall Street Journal, JD Power, and Cirium. While Delta ranked first overall for its consistency across the four categories, TPG noted it lost points for affordability and loyalty — the latter likely resulted from its unpopular SkyMiles program changes. Further, Delta only won in one area: timeliness. This was one of five factors under the reliability umbrella. Interestingly, ultra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Air won for reliability thanks to its low rate of cancellations and mishandled baggage and wheelchairs. It also tied with Delta for zero involuntary bumps. Allegiant ranked seven out of 10 in the overall rankings due to its no-frills business model and poor delay rate. Still, it beat ULCC competitors Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which ranked last and second-to-last, respectively. To their credit, the ULCCs have recently moved in a more premium direction, with Frontier offering ""business"" class-like seats and Spirit dropping all change and cancel fees. Sitting in the middle of the pack are American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and Hawaiian Airlines, which didn't see much movement to their rank from 2022. ""Overall, 2023 was a year of relative stability and continued recovery from the last of the post-coronavirus lockdown hiccups,"" TPG said. Here's a closer look at TPG's airline rankings for 2024. It noted customer satisfaction data only reflects the first five months of the year due to reporting delays from the Department of Transportation. 2022 Rank: 10 Best areas: Affordability Worst areas: Timeliness, cancellations, involuntary bumps, customer satisfaction, and bag and change fees 2022 Rank: 8 Best areas: Affordability Worst areas: Mishandled baggage and mobility devices, family travel, and route network 2022 Rank: 8 Best areas: Involuntary bumps and mishandled baggage and mobility devices Worst areas: Timeliness, cabin features, and family travel 2022 Rank: 6 Best areas: Involuntary bumps Worst areas: Route network 2022 Rank: 7 Best areas: Cabin features Worst areas: Timeliness, cancellations 2022 Rank: 5 Best areas: Bags and change fees Worst areas: Lounges 2022 Rank: 4 Best areas: Route network, award availability (flights that can be booked with points or miles) Worst areas: Mishandled baggage and affordability 2022 Rank: 2 Best areas: Frequent flyer program, route network, involuntary bumps Worst areas: Cancellations, affordability 2022 Rank: 3 Best areas: Timeliness, cancellations, lounges, family travel, customer satisfaction Worst areas: Mishandled baggage and mobility devices 2022 Rank: 1 Best areas: Timeliness and involuntary bumps Worst areas: Affordability Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said it's a ""significant possibility"" that people use their iPhones less with Apple Intelligence, according to an interview with tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee released Wednesday. The CEO said as Apple Intelligence continues to get smarter, previously time-consuming tasks may take less time. The tech giant announced it will integrate AI into its systems at Apple's WWDC event on Monday. The CEO and other executives detailed a number of AI features that will be available on Apple devices with its latest software. Some of the updates include a new and improved Siri with better language understanding and text capabilities, integration across apps, systemwide Writing Tools, and a revamped Photos app that organizes photos into different categories. Apple also announced its partnership with OpenAI, which will allow users to opt into a ChatGPT-powered Siri. The AI chatbot is known to help people be more productive and get tasks done quicker. Cook added that Apple has never been motivated to have people spend their lives on their devices. The CEO has made similar comments before, saying that people need to focus more on the people in the room with them. ""Our model is not one that needs engagement to succeed,"" Cook said in the interview. ""Our model is one that where we want to empower you to be able to do things that you couldn't do otherwise."" Apple has added several features to the iPhone that raise awareness of how much time consumers spend on their devices and which help make their usage more intentional. Features like Screen Time track how much time you spend on your iPhone and put it ""a bit in your face,"" Cook said. The CEO said last year in an interview with GQ that he monitors his Screen Time ""religiously."" The CEO also mentioned Focus settings, which allow consumers to silence their phones or only receive specific notifications. Cook said Apple is homed in on giving consumers tools to do ""incredible things"" that they couldn't do otherwise. ""That's what motivates us,"" Cook said.

99,Theron Mohamed,"South Africa's cash giveaway plan is not universal basic income, experts say",https://www.businessinsider.com/south-africa-ubi-universal-basic-income-poverty-cash-giveaway-anc-2024-6,"A South African program would pay too little money to too few people to qualify as universal basic income, experts say.",2024-06-13T10:24:08Z,"South Africa's top political party has proposed a social safety net that's been called the first national universal basic income (UBI) program. Experts say that's a gross exaggeration. The African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela in the 1990s, recently outlined its plan to expand South Africa's Social Relief of Distress program. The temporary grants were rolled out during the pandemic to help struggling citizens meet basic needs. The ANC, now in coalition talks after winning just 40% of the vote in recent national elections, said it would boost the value of payouts and expand the program to more vulnerable people including caregivers, the unemployed, and the precariously employed. It promised to finalize the policy within two years of being elected. The party also suggested it could fund the program by introducing progressive taxes such as a social security tax, and emphasized it wouldn't replace existing welfare programs or public services. It also signaled it would increase payments and expand eligibility over time. Cleo Goodman, the basic income lead at think tank Autonomy, told Business Insider that the ANC's proposal followed years of basic income advocates making their case through ""pilots, research and widespread campaigning."" South Africa's civil society is also eager to expand the Social Relief of Distress grants to redistribute wealth, reduce poverty, stimulate the job market, and help people cover the costs of finding work, she said. Goodman said that what began as an emergency pandemic response has ""instigated a serious move towards providing genuine economic security, through an unconditional cash transfer system that approaches universality."" Yet the ANC's plan doesn't truly qualify as a UBI program, which usually provides recurring cash payments to all adults in a population regardless of their wealth or employment status, and with no restrictions on how the money is spent. ""Despite the name, this proposal falls far short of a basic income,"" Karl Widerquist, a philosophy professor at Georgetown University-Qatar and the author of several books about UBI, told BI. ""The payments are too small; they are means-tested; and they are means-tested in a way that makes it hard for some of the neediest, eligible people to get the funds they are entitled to,"" he continued. Widerquist also flagged the potential for a ""poverty trap"" where people could lose the entire grant once their income rises above a certain threshold, discouraging them from earning too much and knocking them back when their earnings improve. The writer and academic said the ANC's plans to extend the program are promising, but the initial proposal is only a ""small step in the right direction.""  He added that the timing ""could be good or bad,"" as the ANC's coalition partners could hold it accountable for passing the policy if they support it, but if they oppose it then it ""could easily fall by the wayside over the next few years."" It's not surprising to see the ANC propose a targeted poverty-alleviation program instead of a full UBI scheme. The former is cheaper, less radical, and likely to be more palatable to voters than handing cash to the wealthy — even if new taxes would make them net contributors. But UBI proponents say that giving too little money to too few people doesn't effectively combat poverty, and can stigmatize the grants as welfare checks. A compromise scheme also fails to provide a safety net that allows people to take time to find the right job if they get laid off, and may not fully recognize the value of domestic labor such as child and elderly care either.
