0,Margaret Hartmann,All the Details on Trump & Biden’s Weirdly Early 2024 Debate,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-biden-first-2024-debate-details.html,"Here are all the details on Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s weirdly early 2024 debate, including when the debate will take place, how to watch, who the moderators are, and whether Robert F. Kennedy and other non-major party candidates have qualified.",2024-06-08T09:00:36Z,"The 2024 election is odd in multiple ways. Joe Biden and Donald Trump both clinched their party’s nomination way earlier than usual. They’re the oldest major-party presidential candidates ever. This is the first rematch between two presidents in more than 100 years. Oh, and one of the candidates is now a convicted felon. The two candidates turned up the weird factor even more in May when Biden publicly dared Trump to debate him (using the phrase “Well, make my day, pal.”) Within hours, the two were set to debate in June and September. We’ve never seen a debate process quite like this — and yet, we also watched these two guys face off just four years ago. Here’s what you need to know heading into the unprecedented-yet-very-precedented first presidential debate of 2024. . The first presidential debate of 2024 will be on June 27, 2024 at 9 p.m. ET. The debate will be hosted by CNN, and will be filmed at the network’s studios in Atlanta, Georgia. . The 90-minute debate will air on various CNN properties, and be simulcast on other networks that have yet to be announced. Per the CNN press release: The CNN Presidential Debate will air live on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Español, CNN Max and stream without a cable login on CNN.com. CNN will make the debate available to simulcast on additional broadcast and cable news networks in the United States. . All previous televised presidential debates took place in late September or October. But the Biden team wanted to remind tuned-out Americans that there’s a presidential election this year, and that it could put Trump back in the White House. Per the New York Times: The move was meant to jolt Americans to attention sooner than later about their consequential choice in 2024. Mr. Biden’s advisers have long believed that the dawning realization of a Trump-Biden rematch will be a balm for the president’s droopy approval ratings. The earlier date also gives the two elderly, gaffe-prone candidates more time to recover from any debate missteps. . CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. . According to CNN: • The candidates will not be able to interact with their campaign staff during the debate, which will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks. There will be no studio audience. • The network says moderators “will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.” • The candidates’ microphones will only be turned on when it is their turn to speak; and remain muted at other times. •  They will not be allowed to bring pre-written notes or props to the podium, but will be given a pad of paper and a pen (and a bottle of water). • Which (identical) podium each candidate stands at will be decided by a coin toss. . Only Biden and Trump are definitely in — which may be part of the reason both campaigns agreed to go around the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted presidential debates since 1988. Biden’s public challenge was somewhat for show; the Times reported that the Democratic and Republican campaigns had hammered out debate terms beforehand, as they wanted to “face off directly, without Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or other independent or third-party candidates.” . Yes, there’s still a chance that he could qualify. CNN’s rules state that participants must qualify for the presidency under the Constitution and have filed a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. Five candidates have done so: Biden, Trump, Kennedy, Cornel West, and Jill Stein. The part where things get tricky for the Kennedy, West, and Stein is the requirement that their names appear on enough state ballots to potentially reach 270 electoral votes, and that they receive at least 15 percent in four national polls selected by CNN. West and Stein have been averaging less than two percent in the polls, so they’re out. Kennedy’s RealClearPolitics polling average is just over 9 percent in a five-way race or 10 percent in a three-way race. So there’s a slim chance that he could hit the 15 percent polling threshold. But RFK Jr. has still only qualified for the ballot in eight states, according to his campaign (which says he also has enough signatures to qualify in another nine states). Here’s CNN’s full criteria: To qualify for participation, candidates must fulfill the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution of the United States; file a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission; a candidate’s name must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency prior to the eligibility deadline; agree to accept the rules and format of the debate; and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN’s standards for reporting.  Polls that meet CNN editorial standards and will be considered qualifying polls include those sponsored by: CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, the New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post.  The polling window to determine eligibility for the debate opened March 13, 2024, and closes seven days before the date of the debate. . Probably not, but he’s giving it a try. On May 28 he filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing Biden and Trump of illegally colluding with CNN to keep him off the debate stage. In the complaint RFK Jr. claims CNN’s debate violates the Federal Election Campaign Act. As New York’s Ed Kilgore explained, Kennedy’s effort probably won’t work: …. there’s no legal principle whereby CNN can’t set whatever rules it wants. Team Kennedy is likely working the refs and counting on public pressure to convince CNN to relax its ballot-access criteria on grounds that it creates a double standard benefiting major-party candidates who won’t officially qualify for a single ballot before July (when Republicans formally nominate Trump) and August (when Biden will become the Democratic nominee).  Even if Kennedy gets his way with CNN, there’s a decent chance the Biden campaign could withdraw its own pledge to participate since it didn’t bargain for a three-cornered event (the Trump campaign has not objected to Kennedy’s participation, which may be an indication as to whose candidacy he is more likely to hurt or help in the end). . Biden hasn’t publicly commented on debating Kennedy. Trump has offered contradictory remarks on the subject. In a June 7 Fox News interview Trump claimed he’d “love” to debate Kennedy, but suggested he doesn’t want the polling threshold lowered to let him in. Per the Daily Beast: “And I’d love to have Kennedy in the debate, too,” he then said. “I think it’s important to have him. The problem is, his poll numbers are terrible.”  “So there should be a threshold for him?” Hannity asked.  “Yeah, sure,” Trump replied. “It should be, probably I think they have it at like 20 or 25 percent or something. But his numbers are lousy and they seem to be getting worse. But I don’t mind having him in the debate. I think it would be good.” . They aren’t, at the moment. On June 13 Axios reported that neither Biden nor Trump had started their prep sessions: • “The president will have less time for debate prep than four years ago given his day job, so prep will largely be confined to immediately prior,” a Biden campaign official said. • The message from Trump’s campaign: Debate rehearsals are beneath us. We have nothing to worry about. . The second debate is scheduled for September 10 and will be hosted by ABC News. This post has been updated.

1,Jonathan Chait,Trump Praises J6 Insurrectionists As ‘Warriors’,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-j6-insurrectionists-warriors-las-vegas.html,"Donald Trump used his Las Vegas rally to praise insurrectionists as ‘warriors.’ “Those J6 warriors — they were warriors — but they were really, more than anything else, they’re victims of what happened,” he said.",2024-06-10T13:32:13Z,"Donald Trump has long promised to pardon the members of the mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, to overturn the 2020 election results. He routinely describes them as martyrs (“hostages” is his preferred term) and opens rallies with a version of the national anthem performed by insurrectionists who assaulted police officers with weapons. At his rally in Las Vegas over the weekend, Trump’s description of those criminals changed in an important way. He called them “warriors.” “Those J6 warriors — they were warriors — but they were, really, more than anything else, they’re victims of what happened,” Trump said. “All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That’s what they were doing.” Portraying the insurrectionists as innocent victims is an obvious lie. Portraying them as warriors is more honest, but the candor reveals a confidence that is quite chilling. Trump has inspired the development of a paramilitary wing to his movement. He has goaded their aggressive impulses and rewarded their loyalty. In a second Trump term, they would be unleashed to commit violence on his behalf, understanding they would enjoy the benefit of his legal protection. This was the idea he was promising in broad daylight. Until this weekend, Trump’s pact with his paramilitary supporters was cloaked in the pretense that they weren’t really violent insurrectionists. This was all nonsense. The criminals he praised were among the most violent goons at his coup attempt. The J6 choir, which plays his campaign anthem, is composed of hardened cop-beaters. Trump is increasingly disinclined to conceal the authoritarian nature of his second term. While friendly reporters have tried in vain to coax him into disavowing his threats of revenge, he continues to reissue them. “Well, revenge does take time, I will say that,” Trump said last week, brushing aside Dr. Phil’s attempt to get him on message. “And sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest. Sometimes it can.” The pretense has served its purpose, and Trump apparently now thinks he can stop treating his militarized wing as mere victims. Trump detests victimhood. He adores winners. The ambition he has for the insurrectionists, like all of his movement, is not to be victimized but to dominate. The Justice Department is one instrument of revenge Trump wishes to use on his enemies. His paramilitaries are another. This does not mean Trump will necessarily end democracy or unleash mass bloodshed. But those risks are all too high, and the probability he will damage the system, or set the United States into a cycle of violence and retribution, are scary enough to dwarf every other issue in the campaign. Taxes, immigration, or abortion simply don’t count when the issue on the table is whether the election will hand supreme executive authority to a vengeance-seeking authoritarian.

2,Ed Kilgore,Why Kennedy’s Best Polls May Overstate His Support,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-kennedys-best-polls-may-overstate-his-support.html,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s best polls may overstate his support, in part because non-major party candidates almost always fade by Election Day, and also because Kennedy may specifically be getting inflated poll numbers thanks to question order.",2024-06-11T21:09:52Z,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needs just one more really strong poll showing to meet part of CNN’s criteria for participation in its June 27 presidential debate. The network stipulates that participants secure at least 15 percent in four national surveys no later than June 20 from a specific list of approved pollsters, and Kennedy has three (a Quinnipiac poll and a CNN poll in April, and a Marquette Law School poll in May). He may still fail to make the stage because CNN also requires that participants be on the ballot in states representing at least 270 electoral votes, and the Kennedy campaign is in a fight it may not win over how ballot access is confirmed. But still, the idea that Kennedy is polling as well as any non-major-party candidate since Ross Perot is a good advertisement for his viability. There are, however, two reasons Kennedy’s standing in the race may be significantly overstated by the best of his polls. The first is a matter of history and, well, common sense: as Election Day nears, voters begin to focus on the most viable options and become less likely to “waste their votes” on candidates with slim odds of actually winning. So even the strongest of non-major-party presidential candidates in living memory — Perot in 1992 and 1996, John Anderson in 1980, and George Wallace in 1968 — all lost ground by late summer of the election year and finished well below their peak in polls. It’s one key reason RFK Jr. is frantic to get into a debate with the Democratic and Republican nominees (as Perot, the strongest indie candidate ever, did in 1992); he needs a game-changing development to forestall the otherwise inevitable late-cycle swoon. But there’s another reason that polls showing Kennedy in the mid-to-high teens could overstate his actual support: They are counterbalanced by other polls showing him performing much more poorly. Indeed, all three June polls testing five major- and minor-party candidates (Biden, Trump, Kennedy, Cornel West, and Jill Stein) place RFK Jr. a lot lower: 6 percent at Emerson, 4 percent at Yahoo News, and 3 percent at Economist/YouGov. Why are there such wild gyrations in Kennedy’s standing in the polls? There’s no infallible answer, but the New York Times’ Ruth Igielnik offered a persuasive explanation last month: Question order in presidential polls has a big effect on non-major-party candidates: [M]any reputable pollsters ask both versions of the question: one that poses a simple head-to-head contest between major-party candidates, and one that includes third-party candidates who may be on the ballot.  And which question gets asked first is where the difference comes in. …  Our experiment worked like this: All respondents were shown both the long and short questions, but half were shown the full list first, and the other half were first shown the two-way race.  Among those who saw the long list first, Mr. Kennedy garnered 7 percent of the vote.  But among those respondents who encountered the head-to-head contest before seeing the full list, Mr. Kennedy’s support shot up six percentage points to 13 percent. That’s a very big difference. What explains it?  [I]t is at least partly related to a phenomenon that pollsters call expressive responding. This is when people might use a survey response to show their frustration or express a particular feeling that’s not exactly what is being asked.  In this case, many respondents seem to be using the second question to convey frustration with the choices for president in the first question, whether or not their answers reflect their full views.  Frustration “with the choices for president” is famously high this year. Igielnik goes on to show that most of the recent polls showing Kennedy with double-digit support are those that ask first about the head-to-head Biden-Trump contest before including the other candidates in a second question, while those that present the full list of candidates right off the bat tend to show much lower support for the conspiracy theorist with the famous name. When voters actually vote, of course, they are going to see the full list of candidates without first encountering some frustrating presentation of the major-party choices alone. So the odds are good that Kennedy will underperform his best polls. Indeed, putting together the two factors we’ve discussed, it’s not surprising to learn that RFK Jr.’s standing in the RealClearPolitics polling averages has steadily drifted downward from nearly 17 percent last November to 13 percent as recently as March to 8.6 percent today. Defying history by making a serious run at Biden and Trump will take a lot of doing for Kennedy and isn’t a very good bet.

3,John Herrman,How Siri Made Apple Cautious About AI,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/how-siri-made-apple-cautious-about-ai.html,"The company is still trying to make good on a vision of a personal assistant offered in 2011, writes technology columnist John Herrman.",2024-06-11T18:15:07Z,"At an Apple event on October 4, 2011, the day before Steve Jobs died, Apple VP Scott Forstall took the stage to share details about Siri, Apple’s new voice assistant. “The exact words I say aren’t important,” he said as he asked Siri about the weather in multiple different ways. He asked it about stocks and “great Greek restaurants in Palo Alto.” He asked it to set a timer, give him driving directions, and create calendar events. He emphasized how it could “follow along in a conversation, just like a human does,” remembering what you’ve told it as it moves on to the next task. When it didn’t know answers, he said, it could search Wikipedia or tap into answer engines like Wolfram Alpha. “I’ve been in the AI field for a long time, and this still blows me away,” he said at one point during the presentation. At the time, the demo was incredibly slick, suggesting wild and fantastic futures in which devices listened to us, understood what we were saying, and could handle a wide range of tasks on our behalf; earlier demos, released when Siri was still a DARPA-funded start-up, were even more optimistic, promising to make dinner reservations and call cars for drunk users. Upon wide release with the iPhone 4s, though, Siri was kind of a flop, and Forstall left the company within two years. Its interface and voice suggested human-style assistance, but what it delivered in practice was rigid, limited, and error-prone. Interactions beyond the first step tended to fall apart. Thirteen years later, the most notable thing about Apple’s early Siri demos is how little progress beyond them the company made over the next decade. It got a bit better in a wide range of quantifiable ways, but the company’s first ads for Siri remain basically accurate today. In 2024, for many users, Siri is still a kitchen timer, a weather app, and a tool for narration and transcription. Even the Siri parodies are the same. On Monday, at its big yearly software event, Apple showed off the next generation of Siri, powered by a new AI technology. The presentation was strikingly familiar. “Even if I stumble over my words, Siri will understand me,” the presenter said, echoing the original Siri pitch. She asked about the weather for an upcoming hike and talked about how the app could maintain “conversational context” to schedule it on her calendar. She asked it to bring up an article about cicadas from her reading list; she asked it to show her photos of a specific child in New York City wearing her pink coat. In 2011, Forstall asked Siri to pull up a stock index price; in 2024, Apple’s Siri presentation promised that users would be able to command Siri to, for example, “Show me the price of AAPL.” The presentation felt a bit like an apology. Apple’s new pitch was “Siri, but this time it works.” After Apple’s event, AAPL briefly dipped — in part, perhaps, because Apple’s rumored big push into AI seemed relatively insignificant compared to some of its peers, feeding the industry perception that the new generation of AI tools exemplified by ChatGPT had taken Apple by surprise and that it was struggling to catch up. In truth, as Apple revealed to developers later that day, iOS 18’s integration of tools that might be described as “AI” — a loose and decreasingly useful marketing term — is fairly extensive and reflects intensive investment in a different vision of the technology under the banner of “Apple Intelligence.” Systemwide writing tools will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in most contexts; emails and notifications will be sorted and summarized; calls can be recorded, transcribed, and outlined; photos will be processed in such a way that they can be searched with plain-language requests; and users can remove entire people from photos with a few motions. There were some constrained features for generating media, including an “Image Playground” text-to-image generator and a “Genmoji” tool. Apple’s rumored partnership with OpenAI turned out to be constrained as well: In some contexts, users will be able to ask ChatGPT to generate text; when Siri is unable to answer certain sorts of questions, users will be asked if they want to pass the request along to OpenAI through a system that Apple says will be open to other models as well, keeping the leading AI firm of the current generation at arm’s length. i thought this pic was a shitpost at first pic.twitter.com/dRjbw3tfbu In the superheated corners of the internet where AGI is imminent — or, in an increasingly common rhetorical shift, already here — this was underwhelming. OpenAI leadership is talking about the end of human labor and emerging superhuman intelligence, countless AI start-ups are promising “agentic” super-Siri assistants, and Google’s CEO is comparing AI to the discovery of fire. Meanwhile, Apple is relegating ChatGPT to a plug-in and giving its users a bunch of little utilities and widgets. Another view is that Apple is merely being cautious, and with good reason. In 2011, it was easy to get excited about AI as it was defined and known then. Voice recognition alone felt magical, and Siri’s ability to parse a small range of spoken questions made extrapolation tempting and intuitive: If it can understand some things now, it will be able to understand many things soon; if it can usefully talk to some parts of my phone, which can interact with some real things in the world, soon it really will be a personal assistant. The fact that it had a voice, communicated in a conversational format, and told occasional jokes encouraged this line of thinking — a truly versatile Siri was just a short matter of time. In 2011, Apple was in a position not entirely unlike Microsoft is today, hitching the future of one of its most important products to a dazzling AI tool created by another company. There have been legitimate and huge advances in the field in recent years, and the range of tasks that software can assist with or accomplish on its own is expanding in every direction. But for those who were paying attention at the time, it’s worth remembering how magical it felt to talk naturally to a smartphone for the first time, the wild possibilities that it evoked — and what actually happened next. Many of the largest companies in technology are indicating that they’re all in on AI, whatever they mean by the term, for which they’re being rewarded by investors. In the context of actual advances in the state of the art, Apple’s rhetoric is getting cooler. Its 2024 Siri presentation was, in context, far less ambitious than its 2011 debut. The closest the company has come to talking about AI like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are today was all the way back in 1987, in a marketing video about a theoretical “Knowledge Navigator.” It’s worth watching this video in full for a few reasons. When it comes to hardware, it was fairly prescient: The video is set in 2007, the same year Apple ultimately introduced the touchscreen iPhone, soon followed by the iPad. It was likewise correct, directionally, about networked computers and the web. The virtual assistant promised here, however, is still struggling into existence. In the video, a bow-tied avatar helps deal with a busy schedule, reading the professor’s calendar and parsing his messages. This part is uncannily familiar — it’s how Siri was marketed the first time around. (In this scenario, as in 2011 demos, as in Monday’s demo, the assistant is helping to deal with a scheduled trip to the airport.) What happens next is familiar, too: The professor asks for an increasingly specific trove of information to plan a lecture about deforestation, drawing from the latest literature, narrowing down his data to specific regions, visualizing data, combining data in collaboration with another scholar, and summarizing a missed call from Mom. Avoiding calls from Mom is another recurring theme, here. In 2024, Siri is still saving us from talking to her: This is the best example of Apple’s new AI in everyday life. This could honestly be a gamechanger.#wwdc24 pic.twitter.com/txhxMcb9pM The pitch for Knowledge Navigator is, and was, generic but enticingly intuitive. This is how personified computers had been represented in fiction for decades, as synthetic people, but at the time, the rapid pace of development in computing and networking encouraged forward extrapolation. AI, of a sort, had been a buzzy technology for years. After a period of massive government and private investment in promising AI technology, 1987 also marked the beginning of a long “AI winter,” a period of slowed investment and disillusionment that often follows periods of rapid development and heightened expectations in the field. Knowledge Navigator still doesn’t exist, but its fictional presentation matches, almost beat for beat, the marketing pitches for scores of LLM-powered tools that tech giants and start-ups are promising to bring to market soon. The ability of current AI chatbots to carry on something like conversations, and to generate a wide range of humanlike outputs, makes true personal assistants feel closer than ever — but then again, so did technology that allowed us to speak to software and for it to speak back. Maybe Apple really is just lagging behind, and what we saw on Monday is the best the company can do. Or maybe there’s some institutional memory there about the last time such things seemed closer and more inevitable than they actually were. Apple Intelligence isn’t Knowledge Navigator, and Apple was relatively cautious about promising that it ever would be. For now, the company is leaving that dream to other companies, which are working on products that Apple customers can use through their phones, tablets, watches, and headsets. In another decade, perhaps these firms will have realized one of the tech industry’s oldest visions, bringing about societal transformation and untold riches. Or maybe, they’ll make a great deal of progress before their AI agents and personal assistants collide, once again, with the vexing messiness of reality. It’s a cautious approach by Apple, in the context of companies like Microsoft and Google. But it’s also a reminder that these companies are competitors but not quite peers. Whether AI development keeps accelerating or it slows down and fails to deliver, Apple can still expect to sell a lot of hardware.

4,Ed Kilgore,Trump Doubles Down on Plan for Huge Spending Power Grab,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-doubles-down-on-plan-for-huge-spending-power-grab.html,"If Trump returns to the White House, his radical advisor Russell Vought plans to revive a Nixonian scheme called impoundment to override congressional spending decisions and gut domestic programs, warns Ed Kilgore.",2024-06-08T17:01:19Z,"When people tell horror stories about Donald Trump’s second-term agenda, they usually focus on his plans to seek vengeance against his political enemies via the Justice Department or perhaps special prosecutors. Others may fear the reactionary social policies he is likely to impose, or the sweeping destruction of climate change or workplace regulations. And the whole country may be shaken by the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants that Trump henchman Stephen Miller is planning. But arguably some of the most important second-term plans involve Team Trump’s dark designs on the so-called swamp of the federal bureaucracy. Their interest in tearing down the civil service system is well-known, along with a scheme to fill vacant positions created by mass firings of non-partisan professional employees and their replacement via a so-called Schedule F of political appointees chosen for all the top policy-making jobs in the executive branch. The purpose of placing these MAGA loyalists throughout the bureaucracy isn’t just to ride herd on such bureaucrats as remain in federal departments and agencies. These new commissars would also serve as Trojan Horses charged with advising the Trump high command on how to eliminate or disable executive branch functions the new order dislikes or can do without. A second Trump administration, you see, will be under a lot of pressure from Republicans in Congress and conservative ideologues to decimate non-defense discretionary programs, i.e., most of what the federal government does outside defense (which the GOP will definitely wish to expand) and the big middle-class entitlements like Social Security and Medicare (which Trump has repeatedly pledged to leave alone). Preserving or extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts will force major additional cuts. Non-defense discretionary programs are also where most of the social engineering and income redistribution that MAGA folk hate takes place, in areas ranging from education and environmental protection to health and human services functions. If Trump gets lucky and gets a workable Republican trifecta, perhaps he can go for deep cuts in all these disfavored areas via a vast budget reconciliation bill that Congress will be expected to approve on an up-or-down vote. Otherwise Team Trump plans to excavate a highly controversial device popularized by Richard M. Nixon called “presidential impoundment.” Impoundment involves a claim by the president of the power to override the spending authority consigned to Congress by Article I of the U.S. Constitution. In minor matters and in consultation with congressional appropriators, impoundment was used by most presidents to nip and tuck undesirable spending. But its aggressive deployment by Nixon was very much a leading feature of his “imperial presidency” that eventually led to his impeachment and resignation from office. Subsequently Congress enacted the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which governs the federal budget process even now, and that makes impoundment claims illegal (presidents do retain a limited power to propose “rescissions and deferrals” of some appropriations, but they are subject to approval by Congress). While presidents have invariably complained about the spending decisions of Congress, particularly when their party did not control it, Trump was the first president since Nixon to talk about impoundment as an inherent executive power that had been unconstitutionally usurped. And indeed, his effort to impound $400 million in money appropriated for aid to Ukraine is what led to his own impeachment in late 2019. Indeed, Trump’s budget director Russell Vought was complaining about limits on impoundment literally the day before he left office. That’s significant now because Vought, founder of the Center for Renewing America, is heavily involved in preparations for a second Trump administration, and is generally thought to be the front-runner to become White House Chief of Staff. As the Washington Post reports, the Trump team is planning to make an assertion of impoundment powers central to the MAGA takeover of the federal government, beginning on Day One: Trump and his advisers have prepared an attack on the limits on presidential spending authority. On his campaign website, Trump has said he will push Congress to repeal parts of the 1974 law that restricts the president’s authority to spend federal dollars without congressional approval. Trump has also said he will unilaterally challenge that law by cutting off funding for certain programs, promising on his first day in office to order every agency to identify “large chunks” of their budgets that would be halted by presidential edict. So in order to reassert impoundment powers Trump and his advisors will push their new set of MAGA appointees in the federal departments and agencies to tell them exactly where to make the draconian cuts they will need. It could all hit Washington like a jack-hammer. That impoundment has an unsavory association with Nixon does not bother Trump and his minions; there’s already a revisionist Nixon fan club among MAGA thinkers and writers, focused precisely on the 37th president’s efforts to expand presidential powers to the breaking point. And Vought, the likely architect and engineer of this quick 2025 Trump power grab, has few inhibitions, as the Washington Post explains: A battle-tested D.C. bureaucrat and self-described Christian nationalist is drawing up detailed plans for a sweeping expansion of presidential power in a second Trump administration. Russ Vought, who served as the former president’s budget chief, calls his political strategy for razing long-standing guardrails “radical constitutionalism….”  [Steve] Bannon, the former Trump strategist ordered this week to serve a four-month prison term for contempt of Congress, touted Vought and his colleagues as “madmen” ready to upend the U.S. government at a recent Center for Renewing America event.  “No institution set up within its first two years [has] had the impact of this organization,” Bannon said. “We’re going to rip and shred the federal government apart, and if you don’t like it, you can lump it.” That’s not a threat but a promise.

5,Matt Stieb,Alex Jones Is Finally Screwed,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/alex-jones-to-liquidate-assets-in-sandy-hook-settlement.html,Infowars founder Alex Jones has just filed to liquidate his company after stalling for years on the payments in the billion-dollar Sandy Hook settlement.,2024-06-07T16:09:31Z,"For a while there, it seemed as if Infowars founder Alex Jones was successfully stalling the payments to the Sandy Hook families, to whom he owes close to $1.5 billion in damages for defamation and emotional distress for lying about the murder of their loved ones. Nearly a year after the judgment came down in 2022, he was still spending lavishly on housekeepers and keeping up his boat, even as the families he defamed did not see a penny. In the midst of his personal bankruptcy, he was fighting to keep his control of Infowars, in part to retain his $1.5 million salary there. But late on Thursday, Jones finally buckled when he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate his assets — meaning that he is going to sell his ownership stake in the parent company behind Infowars, the conspiracy site that brought him fame and millions as he peddled misinformation and dietary supplements. The move is a major win for the Sandy Hook families, who filed an emergency motion in federal bankruptcy court on Sunday claiming that Jones and his company had “failed to demonstrate any hope of beginning to satisfy” their claims.

6,Margaret Hartmann,Trump Can’t Accept That Taylor Swift Hates Him,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-taylor-swift-hates-him.html,"Donald Trump can’t accept that Taylor Swift hates him. He wondered if she’s ‘legitimately liberal’ or it’s ‘just an act,’ though the Eras Tour artist accused him of ‘stoking the fires of white supremacy’ and endorsed Biden in 2020.",2024-06-10T20:33:55Z,"Over the years, Donald Trump has repeatedly embarrassed himself by picking fights with musicians who are much cooler than he is, from John Legend to Rihanna. Now it seems Trump has learned his lesson a little too well. Rather than lashing out at Taylor Swift, Trump has taken the opposite approach: He keeps complimenting her publicly and suggesting she might endorse him in the 2024 election. This just makes Trump look pathetic, as it’s quite clear that she won’t. The latest proof that Trump is in deep denial about his status as a Swift foe comes from the forthcoming book Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass. In a November 2023 interview with the author, Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh, Trump was asked to share his thoughts on the Eras Tour artist. He could have said something noncommittal. Instead, according to a book excerpt released by Variety, Trump gushed about how “beautiful” Swift is, which is the highest compliment he can think of for a woman: Trump, usually one to punch back at critics, is smart enough to know Swift’s fame is on another level. “She’s got a great star quality,” Trump says. “She really does.” Trump is effusive as he uses one of his favorite adjectives to describe women — “beautiful” — several times in a row.  “I think she’s beautiful — very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she’s liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump. I hear she’s very talented. I think she’s very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!” It’s her fame, not her songcraft, that fascinates Trump. When asked about Swift’s music, played so frequently on the radio that it’s inescapable in daily life, he says, “Don’t know it well.” This is somewhat plausible. While there’s video of Trump driving around a listening to “Blank Space,” it doesn’t seem that Swift songs get much play when the former president is DJing at Mar-a-Lago. But Trump strained credulity when he suggested that as a “country star,” Swift might secretly be MAGA: Beyond Swift’s looks, what intrigues Trump the most is the idea — frequently bandied about online before she endorsed the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee in 2018 — that she could secretly be supporting him. “But she is liberal, or is that just an act?” he asks me. “She’s legitimately liberal? It’s not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.”  I tell Trump that Swift is no longer a country star; she’s been making pop music for years. He doesn’t seem aware of this, but he reaches for a different name. “Garth Brooks is liberal. Explain that! How does it happen? But he’s liberal.” Trump trails off. “It’s one of those things …”  No one should expect a 77-year-old show-tune lover to have his finger on the pulse of American pop music. But you’d think that Trump would remember how Swift repeatedly criticized him on Twitter in the lead up to the 2020 election and endorsed his opponent, Joe Biden, several months later: After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? ‘When the looting starts the shooting starts’??? We will vote you out in November. @realdonaldtrump Donald Trump’s ineffective leadership gravely worsened the crisis that we are in and he is now taking advantage of it to subvert and destroy our right to vote and vote safely. Request a ballot early. Vote early. The Swifties were not buying the idea that the star might secretly like Trump; the phrase “STAY AWAY FROM HER” trended on X on Monday, according to Newsweek. And Swift has given no signs that she might lean to the right. She released a whole documentary about her decision to speak out against GOP Tennessee Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn in the 2018 midterms, she’s continually spoken out in favor of LGBTQ rights, and the Eras Tour opens with the anti-Trump song “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince.” Whether Trump was actually ignorant of Swift’s political views or just playing dumb, he got up to speed within a matter of months. By January 2024, he was reportedly fretting about whether Swift was more popular than him and what might happen if she backs Biden again. And on Super Bowl Sunday, he practically begged Swift not to endorse Joe in a post on Truth Social: Since Trump’s strategy for winning Swift over seems to entail calling her pretty, admitting he’s unfamiliar with her work, and taking credit for her financial success, Biden probably doesn’t have to worry about losing her endorsement.

7,Matt Stieb,Trump Tried Really Hard to Heatstroke His Rally Supporters This Weekend,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-is-trying-really-hard-to-heatstroke-his-rallygoers.html,It’s hot out there for a Trump supporter waiting on line at his rallies in the Southwest swing states.,2024-06-10T16:08:54Z,"It’s hot in the southwest United States in June — well north of 100 degrees in Phoenix and Las Vegas over the past few days. But this weather could not stop the Trump campaign in its effort to win Arizona and Nevada, states that could be crucial to the former president’s reelection. Nor would it stop the hundreds of Trump supporters keen on waiting outside to see the Republican candidate in his first rallies since he was convicted of a felony. At Donald Trump’s rally in Phoenix on Thursday, supporters held up pictures of his mugshot as they waited in 110-degree heat to be let into the Dream City Church. After some supporters stood on line for hours in the heat, event staff cut off the line shortly before Trump began speaking at 2 p.m. Onstage at the megachurch, he dreamed of a country in which drug dealers would be executed and the state of Arizona would stop being a “dumping ground for the dungeons of the third world.” Among those who waited on line but could not get in, 11 were hospitalized for heat-related illnesses, according to the Phoenix Fire Department. Here is another person getting an IV pic.twitter.com/QxwNuwEy7p His next rally was on Sunday, held outdoors in a Las Vegas park abutting the airport. Ahead of the speech, Nevada GOP chair Michael McDonald said he did not anticipate any problems; if there were, the cooling stations would take care of it. “This is a dry heat,” he told the Associated Press. “This ain’t nothing for Las Vegas people. But what it symbolizes for the rest of the United States — we will walk through hell” to elect Trump. By the time Trump arrived, it was right around 100 degrees. “I’m up here sweating like a dog,” Trump said. “They don’t think about me. This is hard work.” As he complained about the teleprompters not working well in the bright light, six people were sent to the hospital and two dozen more were treated on-site for heat-related illnesses. Trump, joking around, said the truth about the matter: Trump: Do you feel the breeze? I don't want anybody going on me. We need every voter. I don't care about you. I just want your vote. I don't care. pic.twitter.com/IirvQs123c The dynamic of the Trump campaign putting his most committed supporters at risk is not a new one. Hot weather in Trump-friendly southern states has sent rallygoers to the hospital in past election cycles. In 2020, a rally in Tulsa at the height of the pandemic led to a superspreader event in the area. Soon after attending, former GOP candidate Herman Cain was hospitalized with COVID and died. At least in the post-pandemic campaign, Trump’s team most likely won’t have to feel bad about potentially killing anyone this time around.

8,Kevin T. Dugan,Elon Musk (Kind of) Gets His F-You Money,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-kind-of-gets-his-f-you-money-in-shareholder-vote.html,"Elon Musk, the world’s third-richest man, got a vote of confidence from Tesla shareholders as his control over the company was called into question. The vote may not give him back his old money, but it does solidify his control into the future.",2024-06-13T21:16:06Z,"Elon Musk made about $5 billion today as Tesla shares rose today. Good for him. The reason: On Thursday, Tesla shareholders reiterated their support for a $46 billion pay package that was struck down by a Delaware court earlier this year. But the vote doesn’t just hand him money and Tesla shares — not yet, at least. In fact, he may never get them, if appellate judges in Delaware decide that this is a meaningless gesture. The real value of the vote is that it solidifies his control over Tesla now, during a chaotic period when the company has lost about 60 percent of its value and Musk tries to transform it from an electric-vehicle maker into some kind of AI-powered robotaxi service. In other words, it gives Musk another reason to tell his doubters to fuck off. Early results of the shareholder vote, at least when it came to Musk’s pay package, were made known on Wednesday night, about a full day before the actual close of voting. On X, he broadcast that Tesla shareholders, who tend to be extremely pro-Musk, had approved his 304 million shares in compensation — worth about $46 billion today — by a “wide margin.” By the time all the votes were tallied on Thursday, Musk had officially had his pay package approved — though by how much wasn’t initially revealed. (In 2017, it passed with 73 percent of shareholder votes). This is a real vote of confidence in the CEO, so much so that shareholders overcame concerns about a possible $25 billion tax bill and steeply declining sales to signal that they are still on Team Elon. (The other vote referenced is about incorporating the company in Texas, a move that was instigated by his unhappiness with the decision in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated.) Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!♥️♥️ Thanks for your support!! ♥️♥️ pic.twitter.com/udf56VGQdo The thing about this Musk is that, unless we collectively decide to abolish money and return to the barter system, he will always be insanely rich. He has even said before that this pay package really isn’t about money but about ownership of Tesla. Musk has 13 percent of the company, and he wants at least 25 percent. This package gets him more than halfway there. Musk believes he needs these additional shares in order to keep Tesla’s AI systems safe. The subtext here is that, without him acting as an AI bulwark, some outside investor could turn his systems against humanity or something. That’s certainly an argument. But it’s doubtful that any shareholders had that in mind as they cast their votes this week. If anyone knows anything about the power of signaling, it’s Musk. (After all, he was one of Twitter’s most important users for years before he bought the social-media company and rebranded it.) Musk also knows something about quixotic legal battles that go nowhere. (In fact, he dropped his most recent lawsuit against OpenAI over breach of contract, even though he apparently never had a contract during his brief stint with the company.) A more cautious CEO might have waited to show these results, since shareholders could theoretically reverse them. But if you take the vote as a more general vote of confidence in Musk’s vision of the future, then of course he would want to get it out as early as possible. In a way, it even goes beyond that by encouraging Musk to sidestep one of the most powerful and respected business judges in the country. “In many ways, this feels like a sort of stare-down contest with the Delaware courts,” Ann M. Lipton, a business-law professor at Tulane University School of Law, told me. So he may still lose an old pay package — but what he gains is the right to do whatever he pleases with Tesla for the foreseeable future.

9,Jonathan Chait,Wall Street Journal: Why Does This Mob Crook Keep Getting Charged With Crimes?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/wsj-why-does-mob-crook-donald-trump-keep-getting-charged.html,"‘The Wall Street Journal’ ran an editorial in 2015 headlined “Trump and the Goodfellas,” scolding his history of working with mobsters and continuing to praise them. Now the ‘Journal’ thinks Trump’s rap sheet is proof the system is unfair.",2024-06-13T16:56:12Z,"When Donald Trump first emerged on the political scene, one of the main arguments the Republican Establishment made against nominating him was that he was a crook, or at least constantly surrounded by crooks. The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial in 2015 headlined “Trump and the Goodfellas,” criticizing his history of working with and continuing to praise mobsters. When Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was sentenced in 2017, the Journal scolded his “poor judgment for hiring the notorious Beltway operator” who committed a “financial and lobbying scam, which is exactly what Mr. Trump risked in hiring a swamp denizen.” And, while it has taken some time, subsequent events have vindicated the original concerns about Trump’s sleazy ways. A huge number of his associates have been convicted of crimes, as has Trump himself. But as Trump took hold of the GOP, his Republican critics had to either swallow their criticisms of his crookedness (the Journal itself spiked a second editorial on Trump’s mob ties after he won the nomination) or leave the party. The new Republican view is that the reason Trump is facing a slew of criminal investigations and so many of his associates have gone to prison is that the criminal justice system is biased against Republicans. Matthew Hennessey, an editor at the Journal opinion page, has a column painting Trump and his associates as victims of Democratic “lawfare.” Hennessey’s argument is that the sheer length of the Trump-world rap sheet is proof the legal system is meting out disparate treatment against Mr. Trump. Here is Hennessey’s thesis: Justice is supposed to be blind. The legal jihad against anyone who ever did political business with Donald Trump has many wondering whether that’s still true. The list of Trump associates targeted by Justice Department special counsel investigations and Democratic prosecutors around the country is astonishingly long. It’s total lawfare. The first example Hennessey cites for this disparity is that Robert Mueller brought charges against Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and Michael Flynn, but that “anyone at the FBI who actually did meddle in the 2016 election” was “never prosecuted.” This does sound kind of unfair until you consider three points. First, Robert Mueller is a Republican, and while Trump prefers to handle the fact that many Republicans find him unfit for office and a criminal by defining them as Democrats, it does not make it so. Second, there absolutely was a special-counsel investigation into the FBI interfering in the 2016 election. Trump demanded, and received, a yearslong probe by John Durham, a famed prosecutor, who tried extremely hard to prove the theory that the FBI plotted against Trump. The trouble is that the theory failed to produce any convictions. Its only charges melted in court. Republicans spent most of the time Durham was at work rubbing their hands gleefully in anticipation of the gigantic scandal he was going to uncover. Now they sadly remember Durham’s face-plant as more proof that somehow there was a real conspiracy against Trump that was “never prosecuted.” And third, the fact that numerous Trump associates were found to have committed crimes is easily explained by the hypothesis once raised by the Journal: that Trump is a huge crook. “You can read the lamentably long list of Trump-world legal woes as evidence that no one is above the law, which is the view of most Democrats,” Hennessey argues, “Or you can read it the way half of Americans and 83% of Republicans do — as clear evidence that a politicized justice system went after Mr. Trump and his associates because of who they are.” None of this would have happened under President Ted Cruz or President Ron DeSantis. That was a big reason the Journal wanted those guys to be the nominee! Of course Trump’s various goons are being convicted of crimes at much higher rates than the Democrats. The “lamentably long list of Trump-world legal woes” is basically what you’d expect if you handed the most powerful office in the world to a mobbed-up professional swindler.

10,Kevin T. Dugan,Has Elon Musk Finally Lost Tesla Shareholders?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/has-elon-musk-finally-lost-tesla-shareholders.html,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing the prospect of a $56 billion rebuke not from the government or a judge, but from his own shareholders, as they attempt to reverse a Delaware Chancery court decision striking down his extraordinary pay package.",2024-06-12T15:24:20Z,"Elon Musk is perilously close to an embarrassing defeat — this time, not from a shadowy government regulator or a woke mob, but from his own biggest supporters: Tesla shareholders. On Thursday, shareholders will vote on whether to authorize a compensation package worth tens of billions of dollars after an earlier version was struck down in court early this year. If approved, Musk would go from earning about 13 percent of the company to more than 20 percent, an additional 304 million shares. But, with the value of the company down about 60 percent from its peak, and with Musk blowing his sales goals, Tesla’s shareholders are not lining up behind him with the kind of lockstep fanboy fervor you’d expect to see. Up until this year, Musk pretty much thought he had this deal done. Back in 2018, Tesla’s shareholders had okayed the largest-ever CEO compensation plan in corporate America, some $56 billion worth of shares at its height, a figure that, by itself, would have made him the 24th-richest person on earth in today’s ranking. (It’s worth about $47 billion now.) But in January, the Chancery Court in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, struck it down. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick called it “an unfathomable sum” but also found problems with how it all came about. The board, which includes Musk’s brother and close friend James Murdoch, apparently rubber-stamped the package and didn’t disclose that it was based on sales and stock-price metrics they figured Tesla would reach anyway. Now, he is trying to get a do-over. It isn’t going well. Norway’s public investment fund, which owns about one percent of the company, said it would vote against it. So did a giant California pension, as did the two most influential proxy-voting firms, Glass Lewis and ISS, who often have significant sway over how Wall Street votes on corporate proposals. At least one analyst thinks Musk doesn’t have the votes. Here’s everything we know about Musk’s pay package and what it means if he loses. What is the pay package all about? In March 2018, the board of Tesla set a dozen goals that tied Musk’s compensation to Tesla’s share price, as well as how much money the company generated. For instance, the most ambitious goal was getting Tesla to a market value of $650 billion — which he easily cleared, since the company’s peak value was about double that in November 2021. (At the time, it was worth less than a tenth of that.) Every milestone he reached, he got more stock options. At the time, the board tried to argue that it was a reasonable way to compensate Musk, since the pay was entirely based on his performance, and he wouldn’t take any salary. It was, essentially, an all-or-nothing deal to show how focused he was on making Tesla a giant. Why did Tesla need to pay him that much money? That depends on who you ask — and when. “None of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,” Musk told the New York Times in 2018. “I want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species” — a goal, he added, that “obviously requires a certain amount of capital.” Musk has apparently changed his mind since then, endorsing the view that a larger stake in the company is not “motivated primarily by the wish to protect humanity” and is more about controlling how Tesla uses artificial intelligence. The board’s reason — at least, its official stated reason — is that it was essentially a way to get Musk to focus on Tesla, since he split his time between so many companies. At first, it was “to build what is the world’s first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company, from generation to storage to consumption,” the company said in January 2021. After the pay package was challenged in court, the company conceded that it was trying to motivate Musk to spend more time on Tesla. “The Plan motivated Musk to focus his exceptional talents on Tesla when Musk’s future with Tesla was uncertain, especially given his other interests and opportunities,” the company reportedly said in court. (At the time, he had four companies; now, after buying Twitter and starting xAI, he has six.) A more recent letter from the Tesla chair says the package is explicitly “about retaining Elon’s attention and motivating him to focus on achieving astonishing growth for our company.” To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with that. “Any CEO compensation package is meant to motivate the CEO. That’s the whole point,” says Ann M. Lipton, a business-law professor at Tulane University Law School. “You design compensation packages that are supposed to align the CEO’s incentives with producing whatever results you want. So if what you want is profits, then you create a compensation package that will motivate profits.” But, wait, doesn’t Musk control Tesla’s board? Yes — in fact, that’s one of the main questions the Delaware lawsuit hinged on. Chancellor McCormick found that the pay package was not, in fact, some decision made by an independent board, but a plan dreamed up by Musk and rammed through a board that was beholden to him. “In the final analysis, Musk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,” McCormick wrote in her decision striking down the pay package. “The process arrived at an unfair price. And through this litigation, the plaintiff requests a recall.” Why is that judge’s name familiar? Chancellor McCormick and Musk have some history together. The judge in the business court also oversaw Musk’s sprawling, bungled attempt to get out of buying Twitter at $44 billion back in 2022. (Musk lost.) He didn’t endear himself to the court then, either. So Musk lost that entire pay package? For now, but he will have the chance to appeal the decision after Chancellor McCormick issues her final decision and wraps up other legal odds and ends. This shareholder vote is a redo, then? Essentially. Tesla has framed the vote as a chance to fix the problems that McCormick identified in her decision around fairness and transparency, which would then, in theory, eventually lead to Musk getting his reward. “We do not agree with what the Delaware Court decided, and we do not think that what the Delaware Court said is how corporate law should or does work,” Tesla’s board wrote in its proxy statement. “So we are coming to you now so you can help fix this issue — which is a matter of fundamental fairness and respect to our CEO. You have the chance to reinstate your vote and make it count. We are asking you to make your voice heard — once again — by voting to approve ratification of Elon’s 2018 compensation plan.” But even if it passes, it could end up being a waste of time. There is no precedent for this, Lipton says, and the vote may even muddy the waters about what Musk is ultimately trying to achieve. “The weird thing here is that this was a pay package that was designed to motivate him in 2018 with a specific set of goals in mind,” she says. “It is not clear what ratifying this post-hoc is motivating him to do.” What will happen if he loses the shareholder vote? Immediately, Musk’s net worth would fall by roughly 25 percent. (That would make him merely the 17th or so richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg.) It would also make his odds of prevailing against the Delaware courts more of a long shot, since he wouldn’t be able to argue that Chancellor McCormick was reversing the will of the shareholders. And maybe he’ll leave Tesla. The board is essentially arguing that, if they don’t pay him more, he’s going to leave and spend more time at SpaceX, or X, or xAI. It could happen, but Musk isn’t exactly well known for following through on promises that don’t benefit him. Maybe he’ll personally dedicate himself to increasing the world population, since he talks about it so much (although that is increasingly getting him in trouble). But some shareholders are more concerned with what will happen if he stays. Musk has said that he wants 25 percent of the company to effectively have oversight over its AI business, which is becoming increasingly important as its car sales drop off. “Stockholders cannot cast meaningful votes on Musk’s pay package while his threat hangs, like the sword of Damocles, over Tesla’s future, and thus their own,” according to an essay by Lucian Bebchuk, the director of Harvard’s school of corporate governance, and Robert Jackson, a former SEC commissioner who teaches at New York University’s law school. “He’s allowed to demand more money from Tesla, and he absolutely is,” Lipton says. “He can demand whatever he wants to from Tesla. But what he arguably can’t demand — and the implication keeps coming forward — is that if he doesn’t get paid he will continue to work at Tesla, but mismanage it. And that’s where it crosses over into potentially coercive to shareholders, and that’s one of the arguments shareholders are making right now.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
11,Matt Stieb,Elon Musk Is All of a Sudden Drowning in Misconduct Allegations,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-misconduct-allegations.html,"Elon Musk is suddenly drowning in misconduct allegations. Several fired employees sued the SpaceX founder for sexual harassment and retaliation, and he’s been accused of having inappropriate relationships at work.",2024-06-12T20:46:02Z,"Eight SpaceX employees who were fired in 2022 sued Elon Musk on Wednesday alleging that they were ousted for raising allegations about sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the company. The lawsuit, filed in California, alleges that Musk “knowingly and purposefully created an unwelcome hostile work environment based upon his conduct of interjecting into the workplace vile sexual photographs, memes, and commentary that demeaned women and/or the LGBTQ+ community.” The sexual-harassment and retaliation suit focuses on an incident in 2022 in which Musk posted jokes about the sexual-misconduct allegation levied against him by a SpaceX flight attendant. After Musk made these jokes, the defendants in the lawsuit wrote an open letter calling out his crude statements and the company culture — for which they allege they were fired. According to the suit, Musk himself made the decision to fire them after a human-resources member claimed that an investigation should be launched before letting the defendants go. “I don’t care, fire them,” Musk said, according to the complaint. Already, a majority of the defendants have raised their concerns with the National Labor Relations Board, which found in a filing last month that Musk illegally fired them. SpaceX — which has not responded to requests for comment — then sued the NLRB in response. Musk has faced allegations of sexual misconduct before, including an incident in 2016 in which he allegedly offered a horse to a flight attendant in exchange for an erotic massage; SpaceX then paid the woman $250,000 to stay quiet. But the timing could create significant problems for the world’s richest man. Late on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had sexual relationships with several female staffers at SpaceX — having sex with a former intern 20 years his junior, having sex with a direct report, and asking another employee to have his children. (Musk did not comment on the allegations.) With all this on the mind of Tesla shareholders, Musk is facing a vote over his pay package that could cost him tens of billions of dollars if he loses.

12,"Ed Kilgore,Jonathan Chait,Benjamin Hart",Do We Really Need National Political Conventions?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/should-we-get-rid-of-national-political-conventions.html,Ed Kilgore and Jonathan Chait debate whether national political conventions are a pointless waste of money or valuable messaging opportunities.,2024-06-13T18:57:29Z,"Today at the virtual office, the reports that Donald Trump had knocked Milwaukee — the host city of the upcoming Republican National Convention (which he might not even attend) — kicked off a quadrennial debate in the Intelligencer Slack channel: What’s the point of holding big national political conventions anymore? Below is the brief resulting chat that followed. Chas Danner: We’re fast approaching a time when these conventions are background non-events. Ed Kilgore: About damn time. Benjamin Hart: Why do they exist at all? Waste of time, money, attention … Ed: (a) Media interest, (b) free advertising, (c) great locus for fundraising events. Ben: Yeah, it was a rhetorical question — but it’s all so outdated and pointless. At least cut it in half. Ed: I’ve been advocating for the extinction of these events for many years and thought we had gotten there in 2020. Jonathan Chait: Disagree. I think conventions have a useful role in conveying party ideas to low-info voters. Ed: An exceptionally inefficient way to do so. Jon: Just basic things like which party wants to ban abortion, which party wants to spend more on poor people. That’s stuff people need to know. Ed: Same answer. Jon: I don’t know if ending the conventions will lead to a more efficient way to convey that. Ed: It could and should. Jon: What way is that? Ed: The “messaging” content of conventions is set weeks or even months before the convention. Just have a big event (paid or free) that broadcasts it. You don’t need 3,000 delegates and all the other trappings left over from deliberative conventions. Jon: Sure, the key is for all the networks to cover it. Ed: I think they’d cover an event of the type I am describing. And it would not require a four-day event. Jon: I don’t think having a few thousand people converge on a city for a few days is a giant social cost; groups hold big conventions all the time. Ed: At a huge cost to taxpayers, by the way, since business and professional convention expenses (even one a year outside the U.S.) are tax-deductible. I think the parties keep doing this strictly out of inertia. Is it the worst thing going on in U.S. politics? Of course not. Is it still a stupid thing to do? I’d say so, and I’m pretty sure I’ve been to more of these damn things than anyone else here. 2020 offered the perfect excuse to at least streamline conventions and make them largely virtual. The question is whether there’s any need to backslide now. Jon: I just don’t see the cost to taxpayers as amounting to anything in comparison to the educational value. Ed: We’re just going to have to disagree on this one, Jon. Paid party ads through multiple media channels could provide the same “educational value,” as would staged media events (like the debates).

13,Matt Stieb,The Scam at the Heart of the Mysterious Epoch Times,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-bill-guans-alleged-laundering-at-the-epoch-times.html,"‘Epoch Times’ CFO Bill Guan was charged by federal prosecutors with money laundering, opening huge questions about the health of the pro-Trump outlet with ties to the Falun Gong.",2024-06-07T09:00:39Z,"Five years ago, a niche newspaper called The Epoch Times made a big bet on Donald Trump. The outlet, associated with the exiled Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, never gained too many readers by handing out its free broadside condemning the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. But when Trump came into office, its editors found a hitmaker: pro-Trump stories and conspiracist clickbait. In 2019, as his reelection campaign warmed up, The Epoch Times increased its efforts to cover Trump favorably. It also extended its ad budget, spending more on pro-Trump advertising on Facebook than any group except the campaign itself. The paper was eventually banned from Facebook for trying to obscure its pro-Trump ad buys, but the bet paid off. The Epoch Times was scoring interviews with Cabinet members. Former Trump advisers such as Steve Bannon were teaming up with its parent media company for documentary projects. In one suspicious instance, an Epoch Times photographer got into a restricted area in the White House and handed Trump an unmarked folder; the matter was never fully explained by the administration except for a statement saying it had been “dealt with.” In 2020, Trump’s press secretary invited The Epoch Times into the White House press-briefing room. As the pandemic raged, the paper leaned into the opportunity to distribute viral misinformation, calling COVID the “CCP virus.” Today, it is entrenched in the conservative media landscape, particularly for its health coverage. Last week, a Republican senator published an Epoch Times op-ed on the pandemic response. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said last year that he is a daily reader. Tax records showed the expansion strategy was successful. The Epoch Times Association, the nonprofit behind the paper, pulled in $70 million in revenue in 2020 — tens of millions more than in the nine previous years combined. When banks asked about the surge in money coming in, the chief financial officer, Weidong “Bill” Guan, said the influx came from an increase in “online donations.” “I always assumed there was some type of underwritten donor, but the management never really let us into that side of it,” says Steven Klett, a politics reporter on the paper’s digital team for the 2016 election. “They were very cagey if we ever brought it up.” This week, the Justice Department suggested the growth in 2020 had been fueled by another source of revenue: On Monday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Guan with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering for allegedly running a yearslong scheme to launder at least $67 million in illegally acquired cryptocurrency through the company. Little is known about Guan, a 61-year-old executive living in a modest New Jersey duplex, who was arrested on Sunday morning and pleaded not guilty. (Through a federal public defender, he has declined requests for comment.) But prosecutors say Guan ran a money-laundering operation out of one of the newspaper’s foreign offices. He was direct with his goals, calling the alleged fraud the “Make Money Online” team. In early 2020, Guan and his team allegedly bought tens of thousands of prepaid debit cards that were loaded with illegal funds obtained “through various frauds,” according to the indictment. Prosecutors provided little detail on the origins of the ill-gotten cash but did allege that Guan had laundered fraudulently obtained “unemployment-insurance benefits” — suggesting a laundering connection to the rampant unemployment fraud in the first pandemic year. After obtaining the funds, Make Money Online allegedly cashed out on a crypto exchange for 70 to 80 cents on the dollar, then placed the clean funds in bank accounts associated with The Epoch Times. The plan was not complicated; prepaid cards are commonly used by crypto scammers. And soon enough, prosecutors say, banks were flagging the Make Money team’s transactions. In June 2020, one bank marked The Epoch Times’ surge in income as suspicious. This was when Guan replied that it was just “online donations” for which it happened not to have an invoice. In December 2020, a second bank flagged the increase in funds as suspicious; Guan replied by email that the company was simply getting “more and more donations from our supporters because more and more people like our media.” That month, Guan was also warned outright by a prepaid-debit company that all their transfers had been made with “stolen/fraudulent funds, which leads us to believe these are all money-laundering attempts.” According to former Securities and Exchange Commission official John Reed Stark, these schemes inevitably attract federal attention. “Any time you’re using a prepaid debit card with other anonymizing techniques, you’re going to raise anti-money-laundering concerns,” he said. Prosecutors claim the scale of the alleged scam can be seen in The Epoch Times Association’s tax documents. After the banner year in 2020 — when Guan allegedly began his laundering operation — The Epoch Times raked in over $120 million for each of the next two years. Prosecutors say the alleged scam was ongoing until last month when Guan was indicted. Hours after the arrest was made public on Monday, The Epoch Times announced that Guan would be suspended “until the matter is resolved.” His next appearance in court is scheduled for June 21. During the trial, former employees like Klett hope more information will come out about the newspaper’s international operations and its connections to the secretive Falun Gong movement — and its dance company, Shen Yun — which are run out of a complex south of the Catskills. “It leaves more questions than answers somewhat,” Klett says. “I was expecting something more to do with human trafficking and labor exploitation, just based on my experience.” In previous interviews, Klett has claimed The Epoch Times employed Falun Gong followers on tourist visas; they then lived together in a complex in New Jersey and worked long hours, six days a week, without pay — allegations the paper has denied. Based on what he saw there eight years ago, Klett described the charges this week as “pedestrian.” “This is a really stupid scam,” he says. “It leaves a massive paper trail. And why you would think you would get away with that to begin with? I don’t quite get it.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
14,Jonathan Chait,What is the Sunrise Movement For?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sunrise-movement-climate-change-biden-endorse-election-trump-gaza.html,"Axios reports that the Sunrise Movement, a hub of youth-targetted left-wing activism, is currently withholding its presidential endorsement, and may not endorse President Biden at all. Sunrise has become more apocalyptic than climate focused.",2024-06-07T11:00:39Z,"This week, Axios reported that the Sunrise Movement, a hub of youth-targeted left-wing activism, is currently withholding its presidential endorsement and may not back President Biden at all. While Sunrise is primarily devoted to fighting climate change, the holdup seems to be Biden’s Middle East policy. “President Joe Biden’s attempt to lock down many of the young, climate-minded voters who supported him in the last election is running aground over the war between Israel and Hamas,” reported Politico earlier this year. The group is currently demanding the president “end the United States’ support for Israel’s continued genocidal assault on Gaza.” So despite having passed the largest public investment in green energy in history and signed numerous regulatory measures, Biden may well have to run without the support of, or possibly in the face of active opposition by, the youth wing of the climate movement. This raises the delicate question of what, exactly, this group is supposed to do. The Sunrise Movement’s signature concept is the belief that, since Republicans are unreachable, the way to advance the climate-change issue is to pressure Democrats with shame and unrelenting moralism. The crisis is immediate and totalistic, the solutions obvious, and compromise unthinkable. As Sara Blazevic, one of its co-founders, told Vogue in a laudatory profile, “Almost everybody in Sunrise has lived our entire lives in a world on the cusp of climate apocalypse.” Another founder, Varshini Prakash, located her motivation in depressive fantasies about social collapse. “I spent my college years imagining what kind of bunker we would all need to create to shield ourselves from a militarized band of bandits that were out because the government just collapsed and all of society was in ruin,” she said. This apocalypticism is designed both to motivate volunteers and to give them leverage to press their demands upon Democratic lawmakers. Anybody who opposes these demands, or fails to carry them out because they lack the power to do so, is a liar, a sellout, and a murderer. A key premise of their beliefs is that there is no legitimate disagreement about either the scope of the climate problem or the necessary solutions. They define the problem as “the greed and selfishness of wealthy men, of fossil-fuel billionaires who plunder our earth for profit,” from which it follows that only spinelessness or actual evil, rather than genuine disagreement, causes any Democrat to withhold support for any element of their program. The rationale for their activism is to confront Democratic politicians with the effects of their cowardice, forcing them either to give in or at least to confess their own evil. “We can’t allow him to get away with all of this obstruction and just get off scot-free,” one organizer explained of a confrontation at Senator Joe Manchin’s houseboat. “He needs to look us in the eyes and tell us that his actions will be responsible for millions more deaths around the world and like millions of people who will have asthma who wouldn’t have otherwise or millions of people drinking polluted water.” During the 2020 primaries, Sunrise gave Biden’s climate plan an F- grade. After Biden won, Sunrise targeted the White House with protests and hunger strikes. Members have carried signs with slogans like “BIDEN YOU COWARD FIGHT FOR US” and “BIDEN NO COMPROMISES NO EXCUSES.” Insisting that a given demand is ineffectual, or that Congress refuses to support a given policy, are the kinds of explanations Sunrise does not take well. It has the same impatience toward “excuses” as an old-time football coach. In one key respect, Sunrise is an undeniable success: It has generated an enormous amount of press coverage of its stunts, including many articles praising the organization’s strategy and discipline. “Sunrise has established itself as the dominant influence on the environmental policy of the Democratic Party’s young, progressive wing,” cooed The New Yorker in 2018. Progressive organs like Vox (“The new face of climate activism is young, angry — and effective”) and Mother Jones (“Climate Change Is Finally Having a Political Moment. That’s No Accident”), along with Vogue (“Inside the Sunrise Movement: Six Weeks With the Young Activists Defining the Climate Debate”), have unsurprisingly touted it. The mainstream media have likewise praised it with headlines like “The Sunrise Movement Actually Changed the Democratic Conversation. So What Do You Do for a Sequel?” and “The Sunrise Movement is an early winner in the Biden transition. Now comes the hard part”). But the degree to which these stories have translated into policy change is at best debatable. The Biden administration succeeded in passing climate legislation where the Obama administration had a mixed record (successfully passing what was then the largest green-energy investment in history but failing to enact a cap-and-trade program). The Sunrise Movement’s theory of the case presumes that public opinion is already behind dramatic policy change to fight global warming and that activists are needed to counteract the corrupting influence of fossil-fuel greed. “Majorities of Americans believe climate change is a problem and support clean energy solutions,” wrote Dave Roberts in a defense of Sunrise. In reality, public support for the green-energy transition is paper-thin. Americans may like green energy and oppose climate change in the abstract. But they don’t want to phase out fossil fuels, and they care far more about keeping energy cheap than they do about reducing emissions. Even young people place little importance on the issue. The Harvard Youth Poll found environmental concerns ranked 12th out of 16 issues. This lack of concern has even affected the Sunrise Movement itself. Its activists have repeatedly wandered away from climate and on to other issues. In 2020, the group attached itself to racial-justice protests. Now, its activists seem to care more about Gaza than climate change. In 2021, Sunrise political director Evan Weber claimed the movement represented a large “constituency of young people for whom the Green New Deal is something that they are dedicating their lives to realizing and making possible.” Alas, the cause to which they are dedicating their lives seems to change every couple of years. Today, the quasi-religious fervor that inspires the Sunrise movement’s members is focused on the war between Gaza and Israel. They have employed the same kind of apocalyptic rhetoric and disdain for moral nuance to the issue. The founders of the Sunrise Movement might have believed their innovation was in using apocalyptic rhetoric to raise the urgency of climate change. But this style of thought turned out to be more durable than the specific application. Sunrise has become a lobby for promoting a generalized conviction that the world’s problems are caused by pure evil, that only revolutionary change can avert imminent mass extinction, and that anything short of total salvation is a cause for despair and rage. That belief system has certainly gained support among the young. But it is difficult to find any evidence that it is connected to progress.

15,Kevin T. Dugan,GameStop Doesn’t Care About Its Apes,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/gamestop-doesnt-care-about-its-apes.html,The fatal flaw in meme stock trading is that companies like GameStop and AMC just want their biggest fans’ money.,2024-06-07T15:08:48Z,"You’d think that GameStop would love its biggest fans. So-called apes — the adrenaline-fueled traders who have been rallying around their meme-stock trading leader, Keith Gill — have sent the middling video-game retailer’s shares up more than fourfold since May to a market value peaking around $14 billion on little more than vibes and a sense of What the hell, why not? Last night, Gill (who goes by Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, depending on which social-media platform you follow him on) was all set to become a billionaire, which would be an incredible run up from the $53,000 he originally invested back in 2019. Gill was going to hold a livestream on YouTube, effectively his first public comments in years, which caused the hype to bubble up even higher. But on Friday, GameStop pulled a surprise. They announced dismal earnings in an unscheduled securities filing, which allowed the company to sell 75 million additional shares — diluting the market and sending the share price down as much as 21 percent but giving the company hundreds of millions in extra cash. Unless you were this guy, a Reddit poster who happened to sell his stake last night, chances are you got hosed. This keeps happening to the apes. Last month, just after Roaring Kitty reignited his meme-stock rally, AMC took advantage of the sudden doubling of its share price and sold $250 million worth of new shares. (AMC’s shares are down 20 percent since it hit its peak.) If you’re on the board of a company, of course you’re going to take advantage of a sudden and unexplainable rise in your share price. It is the definition of free money. This is especially true of GameStop. “The market price of our common stock has seen extreme price fluctuations that do not appear to be based on the underlying fundamentals of our business or results of operations” is how the company put it in its securities filings. The actual reality of the company — as opposed to the fantasy that is trotted out on ape forums — is that sales are down 29 percent and the future is looking worse. The sad thing is that the apes seem genuinely oblivious to this. It’s all part of some plan against short sellers or something. The reality is this was no accident. GameStop originally planned on releasing its earnings on Tuesday but clearly took advantage of the hype. Many of the apes genuinely seem unable to fathom that they got played. This is what happens when you identify too strongly with a corporation. GameStop’s only obligation is to make money, and an apes is an easy target, like an employee who’s surprised to learn that his co-workers aren’t really like his family. By the time Gill’s livestream started — 25 minutes late, with nearly half a million people waiting — GameStop was already down 20 percent from its high point of the day. Gill came on in costume, with a fake arm sling, bandages on his face and around his forehead. He pretended he died. Then, he proceeded to say — well, not much. After a half hour or so, the stock was down another 22 percent. “What can I say about GameStop?” Gill asked his followers. “The funny thing is, I have a lot of the same feelings about everything.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
16,Jonathan Chait,Why on Earth Is Chuck Schumer Inviting Netanyahu to Address Congress?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-is-chuck-schumer-inviting-netanyahu-to-address-congress.html,"If Chuck Schumer wants Benjamin Netanyahu gone, he probably shouldn’t have handed the flailing Israeli leader a lifeline, writes Jonathan Chait.",2024-06-08T10:00:36Z,"This post originally appeared in Jonathan Chait’s &c. newsletter, which you can sign up for here. Benjamin Netanyahu’s maneuvers always boil down to a combination of two motives. One is the prevention of a Palestinian state. The other is political survival. At times, the two motives tug against each other. More often, especially of late, they run in the same direction. That is the case now, when Netanyahu is the unpopular leader of a wartime government. His creaking political coalition includes far-right parties that will desert him if he makes even the slightest gesture toward Palestinian self-rule, and halting the war will trigger elections that will probably end his tenure. A CIA analysis predicts he will defy American pressure to commit to some kind of postwar plan for Gaza. If he can keep the fighting going past November, he can probably outlast the Biden administration, and a Trump presidency would give him the chance to reoccupy Gaza. He might even take the chance to undertake some horrific mass population transfer. All in all, his incentives are directly counter not only to American foreign policy, but also to the liberal Zionist project. In that light, Senator Charles Schumer’s decision to invite Netanyahu to address Congress is unfathomable. Schumer, who previously called on Netanyahu to resign, says he is inviting him anyway as a sign of America’s “ironclad” alliance with Israel. But Schumer had previously articulated why Netanyahu’s vision poses an existential threat to Israel’s long-term survival. “Israel moving closer to a single state entirely under its control would further rupture its relationship with the rest of the world, including the United States,” Schumer said. “Support for Israel has declined worldwide in the last few months, and this trend will only get worse if the Israeli government continues to follow its current path.” The same speech explained frankly why Netanyahu refuses to veer from this suicidal path. Schumer received harsh blowback for allegedly dictating to Israelis how they should choose their leaders, and maybe Schumer feels stung by that. But if the criticism is that he should put his thumb on the scale of Israeli elections against Netanyahu, the answer surely can’t be to put his thumb on the scale for Netanyahu. That’s what inviting him to Congress does: It gives Netanyahu the grandest possible world stage to posture as a statesman. While his Israeli critics charge him with isolating Israel, his speech to Congress will give him an apparent answer. There he will be, basking in bipartisan applause. It will undercut the domestic critique of his ineffective and extreme policy toward the Palestinians and make the hard task of correcting Israel’s course even harder. It is hard for me to think of an explanation for Schumer’s action other than sheer spinelessness.

17,Elie Honig,Hunter Biden Is Probably Guilty. But His Prosecution Doesn’t Make Sense.,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-hunter-bidens-prosecution-doesnt-make-sense.html,"His alleged violation of a federal gun law is not a crime that would normally be charged, writes legal columnist Elie Honig.",2024-06-07T10:00:39Z,"I’m trying to imagine how I would have reacted if, back when I was a supervisor at the Southern District of New York, another prosecutor had come to me with this pitch: We’ve got this case on a guy who had a gun almost five years ago. He was a drug addict at the time, and he lied about that when he filled out some forms to buy the gun. He had the gun for 11 days, nobody ever fired it or used it to do anything, and it wound up getting tossed in a trash can. The guy has had major drug issues and ugly familial problems, but no prior convictions.  I would have had two immediate questions. First: What’s the crime? Second: Don’t we have better things to do? I refer, of course, to the criminal trial of Hunter Biden, 54-year-old son of the 46th president of the United States, currently underway in federal court in Delaware. This is the first of two pending Hunter Biden cases brought by DOJ Special Counsel David Weiss (neither of which, it bears noting, has anything to do with the defendant’s father). The “other” case (for now, though it’ll become more prominent when it proceeds to trial this fall) alleges that Hunter Biden fraudulently evaded over $1.4 million in federal income taxes. That case, in federal court in California, appears to be reasonably well grounded in the evidence and is, in my view, a sound exercise of prosecutorial discretion. But the Delaware gun case: not so much. As to my first question above — yes, it is a federal crime for an addicted person to possess a gun. But in all honesty, I had never heard of this law throughout my 14 years as a prosecutor until the Hunter Biden case dropped last year.  The former federal and state prosecutor breaks down the headlines at the intersection of law and politics.  Federal law criminalizes possession of firearms by certain classes of “prohibited persons.” The most commonly charged of these categories, by far, applies to convicted felons. We churned out these cases in our first-year unit at the SDNY. Typically, an NYPD officer grabbed somebody on a drug rip or traffic stop, found a gun, ran the rap sheet, and saw that the guy had a prior conviction. Draft it up, “felon-in-possession,” Section 922(g)(1), done and done. (These cases often proved to be trickier than you might expect, especially if the cop found the gun near but not quite on the person — on the sidewalk nearby or in the center console of a car, for example. We’d lose a lot of these at trial.) After convicted felons, the list of prohibited categories gets narrower and, in some instances, fuzzier: fugitives from justice; anybody who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective” (I’m quoting the statutory language here); any “alien who is illegally or unlawfully in the United States”; anyone who has been dishonorably discharged from the military; and — our category of focus here — any person “who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.” It’s also a crime to lie on federal firearms forms, as Biden seemingly did when he claimed he was not an addict. By mechanical application of facts to law, Biden appears, quite plainly, to be guilty. There’s no question he was addicted to drugs back in 2018 during the relevant time frame. He’s written as much in his book, and there’s plentiful corroborative evidence of the same, including contemporaneous texts about his addiction and testimony from several of Biden’s romantic exes. Same goes for his possession of a firearm. It’s all but admitted, accepted as fact. It’s tough to tell at this moment what the defense will be. The defense team surely will encourage the jury to engage in a bit of nullification — essentially, voting to acquit as a matter of politics or protest, regardless of the evidence. That could resonate in Delaware, where the Biden family is Mid-Atlantic royalty. As for the evidence itself, defense counsel suggested in his opening statement that Biden might not have acted “knowingly,” but it’s unclear how he couldn’t have known he was an addict who had a gun. Perhaps the defense will argue that the term addict is vague or that Biden wasn’t an addict at the very moment he filled out the form and obtained the gun. It’s a tight squeeze. So you’re surely wondering, If he’s obviously guilty, why shouldn’t prosecutors bring charges? That brings us to the second question posed above, the why of it. The answer, in short, is that this is a penny-ante case that rests on a shaky legal foundation and a who-cares set of facts. Prosecutors do not, and should not, mechanically charge every case that meets the statutory definition of a crime. We’re not automatons. Rather, we need to ask a series of prudential questions. Is this case worth our valuable but limited time and resources? Do we need to bring these charges to protect the public? Is there some broader deterrent message or policy goal we need to promote here? When it comes to a gun that was never used and wound up in a garbage can five years ago, where the defendant has no prior criminal history and poses no present threat to public safety, and where the charge would invoke a semi-obscure crime, we can reasonably answer “no” on all of those. There’s evidence that Weiss himself recognizes that this particular case lacks heft. Last summer, DOJ prosecutors walked into a federal courtroom in Delaware and were minutes away from finalizing a deal that would have disposed of this very gun charge for … nothing, essentially. As part of a broader plea deal, DOJ had agreed to give Biden a deferred prosecution on the gun case (before the deal fell apart because of a separate misunderstanding between the parties). This means that Weiss was willing to allow Biden to resolve the gun charges by doing, essentially, nothing — not even a slap-on-the-wrist plea deal for probation. Rather, under the near-deal, the gun case would simply vanish if Biden kept himself clean. As to the legal foundation, the “addict in possession” law faces a questionable future. Conservative groups and individual defendants have recently challenged various federal firearms laws on constitutional grounds, with notable successes. One federal appeals court (not the one where Biden’s trial is occurring) ruled in 2023 that the same “addicted persons” prohibition charged in the Biden case is, in some circumstances, unconstitutional. Given the ideology and recent direction of the Supreme Court on the Second Amendment, it would shock nobody if, someday, they strike down the addict provision altogether. I have no particular personal sympathy or affection for Hunter Biden the individual. He’s a cash-hungry, influence-peddling opportunist. He has made over $11 million by hawking his family’s name in industries where he has zero experience or expertise. His foreign entanglements and family affairs are a mess. His history of addiction merits empathy, but it does not justify years worth of manipulative, self-enriching behavior by an intelligent, full-grown adult of extraordinary means and privilege. But none of that means ordinary prosecutorial judgment goes out the window. I wouldn’t go so far as to call this case an injustice; let’s save that label for the deepest outrages. But I do take issue with Weiss’s uneven, and at times internally contradictory, prosecutorial decision-making. Maybe Weiss notches a win here, but it’s not clear that a conviction vindicates any compelling law-enforcement priority. Or perhaps the defense catches a break and convinces the jury to toss out the charges more as a rebuke to prosecutors than an actual exoneration of Biden. Either way, this is the rare case that ultimately won’t do anyone any good. This article originally appeared in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.

18,Jonathan Chait,Conservatives Angry at Biden’s Anti-Nazi D-Day Speech,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/conservatives-angry-at-bidens-anti-nazi-d-day-speech.html,"President Biden spoke at Normany for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Some conservatives angrily denounced his attacks on dictators and defense of democracy as an attack on Donald Trump, which says something about Trump.",2024-06-07T20:01:15Z,"President Biden commemorated the 80th anniversary of D-Day with a traditional American speech about the civic values this country has taken from that event: Democracy is good, fascism is bad, allies are necessary, etc. Conservatives had two plausible options in response. The highbrow rejoinder would be to praise the speech and note that of course they, too, were rooting for Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. The lowbrow response would be to circulate misleading clips of Biden to make him look older than he actually is. (Many of them did this.) But some elite conservatives chose a third option: Angrily denounce the platitudes about democracy as an attack on their own values. Breitbart’s Joel Pollak complains that Biden’s speech was “a veiled attack on his domestic political opposition in the upcoming election.” Erick Erickson moans, “I don’t think it was appropriate for Biden to turn the remembrance of D-Day into a political attack on his opponent.” It is true that some media outlets interpreted Biden’s remarks as an attack on Trump. But the speech didn’t mention Trump. Nor did it refer to him obliquely. What it did was denounce a series of ideas that Trump does not claim to believe. Biden noted, “Ukraine has been invaded by a tyrant bent on domination.” He warned, “To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable.” He denounced “isolationism.” He praised democracy and warned about authoritarianism: Now, we have to ask ourselves: Will we stand against tyranny, against evil, against crushing brutality of the iron fist?   Will we stand for freedom? Will we defend democracy? What part of that do conservatives object to? Trump doesn’t claim to be an isolationist, a lover of dictators, or an opponent of democracy. They insist he doesn’t want to break up NATO and only wants to toughen up the allies. His supporters only take attacks on these things as an attack on Trump because they understand he actually loves dictators, believes in isolationism, and hates democracy. Pollak, hilariously, uses as evidence of Biden’s scrupulous criticism the following line: “[The D-Day heroes] fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ’40s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and Earth to vanquish [the] hateful ideologies of today?” Hearing the reference to “hateful ideologies,” Pollak’s response is “Hey, that’s us!” All Biden’s rhetoric is totally standard fare from postwar American presidents. This is a bit like how every gauzy Super Bowl commercial in the Trump era about how people should be nice to each other came across as a subtle attack on Trump. When the leader of your party opposes your country’s basic values and human decency, giving a speech touting those values without sounding partisan becomes impossible. Trump fans apparently think the solution is to stop presidents from giving overseas speeches touting American values. Maybe the solution is to nominate a Republican presidential candidate who’s not an authoritarian criminal?

19,Ed Kilgore,Trump Conviction Shows There’s No 2024 Game Changer Coming,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-conviction-game-changer.html,"Polls suggest the guilty verdicts failed to shake the race, so it’s time to give up on the idea that voters may suddenly turn on him.",2024-06-07T18:55:03Z,"For months now, many political observers have stared at polls that show Donald Trump with a modest lead over Joe Biden and have placed a mental thumb on the scales for the incumbent due to “Trump’s legal problems.” This was particularly common (and justifiable) back when it looked as though Trump could be on trial for multiple criminal charges in different cases before Election Day. And even when it turned out the (arguably) weakest case against him was the only one that would reach fruition before November, the available evidence and plain logic suggested that being officially branded as a “convicted criminal” could knock Trump’s candidacy off-balance in a serious way. Anyone holding their breath to see if a guilty verdict in the Trump hush-money trial would impact the election can now exhale. While it’s possible to look at the data and see a glass that is half-empty or half-full, the overall indication is that Trump’s conviction has not changed the race. And on balance, that’s good for the 45th president. Yes, the “story” that emerged from a Manhattan courtroom on May 30 has concluding chapters yet to come, particularly on July 11 when Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled a sentencing hearing for Trump. And we can anticipate hundreds of millions of dollars in paid messages from the Biden campaign reminding voters the president’s opponent is a felon. But in a way, that’s a partial victory for Trump since it reinforces his campaign’s argument that his indictment, trial, and conviction in the hush-money case were a piece of partisan jobbery and not a legitimate criminal proceeding at all. Ideally, the Biden campaign would have liked the conviction to speak for itself without any goosing from a White House that stands accused (without a bit of documentation) of orchestrating the entire prosecution. In other words, facts aside, Trump’s conviction and his overall status as a man perpetually on the wrong side of the law are being perceived through partisan lenses, which in turn will tend to encourage unaffiliated voters to discount them. It’s not fair and it’s not right, but it’s reality. What this means more broadly is that Trump may once again defy expectations based on the available precedents. This has happened an awful lot in the man’s relatively short but eventful career in elected politics, beginning with the moment when many of us were certain that career was about to abruptly end — when he blithely disrespected the very sacred cow of America’s favorite POW war hero: You can argue all day about why Trump seems to be “Teflon Don” or even conclude that it’s not about him but about his feckless opponents in both parties or about an atmosphere of partisan polarization (to which he has definitely and self-servingly contributed) that nothing can penetrate. But whatever it is, we’re in a presidential contest that appears to be all but impervious to the kinds of things that used to be called “game changers.” It’s time to accept at least as a rebuttable presumption that the game isn’t changing. And that has implications for future events like the presidential debates, the two major-party conventions, and the cut-and-thrust of the campaign competition as the November election grows nigh. That doesn’t mean Trump’s going to win, to be clear. “Convicted criminal” or not, he remains relatively very unpopular: He’s incapable of moderating his savage and vengeful message, and this year’s turnout dynamics could make Biden’s base of support more reliable. And Trump’s polling lead, even though it has induced regular panic in some Democratic ranks, has never been more than a few ticks away from vanishing altogether. But no one should expect Trump to self-destruct or persuadable voters to wake up some morning and realize what a terrible man he is. If, late on Election Night, Trump appears on TVs and computer screens as the president-elect of the United States, as he did to the horror of Blue America in 2016 — or worse yet, if he loses and claims victory anyway as he did in 2020 — no one should be that surprised.

But he sure is mad.",2024-06-10T09:00:25Z,"This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. On April 3, 2018, a 49-year-old furniture upholsterer and incorrigible Facebook shitposter named Mark Robinson set fire to North Carolina politics. It happened at a city-council meeting in Greensboro, where officials were soliciting public input about a proposal to cancel an upcoming gun show on city property. Robinson’s hometown, like the rest of America, at the time was reeling from the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people and drew more than 1 million protesters into the streets calling for stricter gun-control laws. “We didn’t want to sell guns,” Greensboro mayor Nancy Vaughan told me. Vaughan was minutes away from banging her gavel when the final speaker strode to the podium: a middle-aged Black man who looked like a retired bouncer, bald and heavyset with a salt-and-pepper goatee and eyebrows that, whenever he became agitated, furrowed in a cartoonish V. “I didn’t have time to write a fancy speech,” he began, shooting a disdainful look at the 12 speakers who came before him, only two of whom had delivered pro-gun statements. “What I want to know is, when are you all going to start standing up for the majority?” By “the majority” he meant people like himself, “a law-abiding citizen who’s never shot anybody,” he explained in a twanging baritone, jabbing his index finger at the ceiling for effect. “It seems like every time we have one of these shootings,” he went on, his voice growing louder, “nobody wants to put the blame where it goes, which is at the shooter’s feet. You want to put it at my feet.” This would ultimately spell death for lawful gun owners once they were disarmed by the government and left at the mercy of gun-toting Crips. “Guess who’s going to be the one that suffers?” he shouted. “It’s going to be me!” To Vaughan, the speech was a bracing, baffling four minutes that, for all the speaker’s boorish charisma, was wildly off-topic. Nobody had proposed confiscating guns — Vaughan was a gun owner herself — and canceling the show would hardly hurt firearm sales in a city that housed plenty of brick-and-mortar gun shops. But Vaughan didn’t realize that their debate and others like it had poked a hive of gun fanatics and culture warriors eager to turn Robinson’s grievance into a national rallying cry. Robinson likely had only a vague notion of this himself. He had spent the last decade building a Facebook following of 15,000 people by putting a Black spin on the ravings of a typical terminally online Gen-X conservative. His race gave him special license to ridicule the “soft headed negroes” who thought Alton Sterling’s killing in 2016 was motivated by racism and to taunt civil-rights legend John Lewis for getting beaten by state troopers. But none of it could have prepared him for what happened after his speech. If you kept tabs on conservative media in the spring of 2018, its impact was epochal, the political equivalent of watching the dinosaur-killing asteroid hurtle into the Yucatán Peninsula. There was life before Mark Robinson, a fiery detonation, and then life after him. Later that night, a clipped version of his speech exploded across conservative messaging apps and social-media feeds, catching even those who followed local politics closely off guard. “Before many of us knew that Robinson was from Greensboro and had spoken just up the street, he was in our inboxes, linked and headlined in screaming type,” wrote journalist Steven Doyle in a column for the Greensboro News and Record. Mark Walker, a Republican who represented Greensboro in Congress, shared the video on Facebook and racked up millions of views, which Robinson estimates helped his own following double overnight. Within the week, a private car was chauffeuring Robinson to Winston-Salem for an interview with Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade on Fox & Friends. “How can we follow you on social media,” asked Earhardt, “and will you ever run for office?” Robinson replied blushingly that he and his wife, Yolanda Hill, had discussed a bid for elected office, but for now he was focused on completing his bachelor’s degree in history from the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. That calculation began to shift after the National Rifle Association cast Robinson in a commercial featuring video from his speech. “Anyone who is concerned with holding onto the Second Amendment, I absolutely think they should join the NRA,” he said solemnly. The organization flew him to Dallas for its May convention, where President Donald Trump was a speaker. The commander-in-chief did not stop by Robinson’s green room, but Robinson flew home dazzled and started to parlay his underground celebrity into appearances where GOP voters might take notice. “I back what Mark Robinson said 100 percent,” a Hillsborough resident named Jeffrey Brenneman told the News and Record at a Second Amendment rally in July. Robinson was fêted by conservative media and gun groups so often — the World Forum on Shooting Activities flew him to Nuremberg, Germany, and gave him an award —  that he quit his job at Davis Furniture, a manufacturing plant in nearby High Point. The more Robinson spoke, the more people seemed to want him on their ballots. “Sometimes others see more in you than you see in yourself,” he wrote in his 2022 memoir, We Are the Majority! Soon, he and Yolanda were brainstorming which elected position made the most sense for a factory worker turned keyboard warrior and ended up with lieutenant governor. “Our lieutenant governor,” explained Chris Cooper, who runs the public policy institute at Western Carolina University, “has about as much power over legislation as the cashier at the local Family Dollar.” For Robinson, a person with no experience in politics and barely any experience in leadership of any kind, it was ideal — a mostly ceremonial position where he could learn the ins and outs of state politics while keeping the media on call. He used an online search engine to find a campaign consultant and hired the third guy listed — a 20-something up-and-comer named Conrad Pogorzelski III who agreed to get started working for free — then waded into a crowded 2020 Republican primary field. The previous year’s groundwork paid immediate dividends. Many of his opponents were more experienced, among them the superintendent of education and a state senator, but none could match the star power he had amassed through coverage from Breitbart, the Blaze, and Fox News. In March 2020, Robinson won the primary with a 32.5 percent plurality of the vote. It was around this time that reporters started digging into Robinson’s Facebook history and unearthed a trove of such vicious invective that it made Trump look restrained. Robinson blasted The View co-host Joy Behar as a “she-beast” and Congresswoman Maxine Waters as “Ol’ ‘Maxie Pad.’” “Note to homosexuals,” he wrote, “Your homosexuality is a FILTHY ABOMINATION, that satisfies your degenerate, un-natural lust.” He mocked what he considered poor refereeing in the NFL as “‘f@g uh-hum I mean, flag football.” “The goal” of transgender people, he wrote, “is to turn God’s creation backwards, and make it into a sickening image of rebellion to glorify Satan.” The Holocaust death toll had been used, he proclaimed, to distract from deaths caused by communism, while Marvel’s Black Panther was “created by an agnostic Jew” in order “to pull the shekels out of your Schvartze pockets.” Lesser offenses have killed bigger candidacies, but 2020 was an unusual cycle. There were several consequential elections in North Carolina that year: MAGA edgelord Madison Cawthorn was gunning for Congress, Cal Cunningham for Thom Tillis’s U.S. Senate seat and a possible Democratic majority, Governor Roy Cooper for reelection, and Joe Biden for the Oval Office. Robinson’s race for lieutenant governor barely cracked the top five, and he flew under the radar by play-acting as an average retail politician, spending hours a day phone-banking and gladhanding. “On the campaign trail,” recalled Blake Harp, Cawthorn’s old chief of staff, “I remember walking into dinners, coffee shops, and small businesses seeing everyone wanting to shake his hand.” There was only so much his Democratic opponent, former state senator Yvonne Holley, could do to sound the alarm about their relatively low-priority contest. “That was the one race,” said Dan McCorkle, a longtime Democratic strategist, “that we, honest to goodness, weren’t thinking enough about.” Robinson defeated Holley 52-48. While he pounded a gavel now and again in his new position, he never had to cast a tie-breaking vote in the legislature and the few meetings he took would be with much more powerful people who did not really need him. But the job had other benefits. In front of hundreds of people at a Right to Life rally in January 2021, Robinson cast his unlikely success as a biblical reckoning. “I would have been on the abortion table had it been up to them,” he bellowed. “I’m standing here as lieutenant governor today because God is that good.” In April, he announced in a Facebook video that he was considering a run for U.S. Senate in 2022 — only to delete the post an hour later without explanation. But the extent of his ambition had become clear. Robinson sallied forth into a series of crusades so trendy and trivial that their only true objective could be higher office. He set up a glorified hotline called the FACTS Task Force where people could complain about leftist “indoctrination” in schools, then submitted an 831-page writeup of its findings to a state-senate hearing. When Democrats shrugged it off as a nonissue driven by Fox News, Robinson stormed out of the room. “An absolute insult!” he exclaimed. He was invited to Capitol Hill to testify about voter ID laws. “How absolutely preposterous,” he snorted in response to the notion that such voting requirements were racist against Black people. He gave barnstorming sermons warning against gay content in schools. “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth,” he boomed at a church in the rural pottery town of Seagrove. “And yes, I called it ‘filth’!” His tirades apparently started to make it into the briefings of Governor Cooper and even President Biden. “The role of a leader is to bring people together,” said White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates about Robinson, “not to spread hate and undermine their own office.” Robinson was a natural showman. “There’s just no risk of Mark Robinson being too boring,” said Cooper, the Western Carolina professor. Each new outburst seemed specially designed to offend the prevailing sensibilities of the moment. In May 2022, just days after a gunman murdered 19 children at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Robinson spoke at an NRA convention a few hours away in Houston. Earlier that month, he had bragged of owning an AR-15 in case “the government gets too big for its britches.” He preached in June of that year  that “we are called to be led by men” rather than women, as an anxious public awaited the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. (“I am overjoyed,” he said when the decision to strip abortion rights came down.) After David DePape allegedly broke into Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco home and bludgeoned her 82-year-old husband, Paul, Robinson posted a photo of a Halloween costume on Facebook of a man brandishing a hammer. “I’m sorry Paul,” he captioned the image, “I don’t believe you or the press!!!!” When Robinson finally announced in April 2023 that he was running to succeed the term-limited Cooper this November, thus becoming the instant and prohibitive front-runner for the Republican nomination for governor, it had been the worst-kept secret in state politics for more than a year. The news thrilled the MAGA wing of the Republican Party, which saw Robinson’s viciousness as a marker of authenticity and adopted him as their Great Black Hope. “Watching the lieutenant governor come out of nowhere was nothing short of spectacular,” said Harp. But as soon as he started facing the heightened scrutiny that comes with a gubernatorial run, his inner circle started hiding him from it. His flak, Michael Lonergan, told me repeatedly that he would not be made available for an interview. “You could always read his book,” suggested his wife, Yolanda, when I reached her over the phone, while his best friend, political allies, and former workplace acquaintances did not respond to several requests to speak with me. This reduced exposure has not harmed him politically. Robinson refused to debate his opponents in the gubernatorial primary — “like boxing a shadow” is how one adversary, State Treasurer Dale Folwell, described the experience — yet handily defeated his more Establishment-friendly rivals by running as a proudly inexperienced folk hero of the unbought MAGA right. In March of this year, shortly before Robinson ran away with a dominant 64.8 percent of the primary vote, he snagged a gushing endorsement from Trump — “You’re better than Martin Luther King” — and will face Democratic attorney general Josh Stein in the general election on November 5. Thus, at the exact moment when Robinson’s personal views and political decisions are poised to have the most serious consequences for everyday people in North Carolina — a moment when he is vying to govern the one of the fastest-growing purple states on an increasingly red-or-blue electoral map — he is becoming less accessible and less transparent. Some things we know: He spawned from the same murky depths of social media where Fox News checks its pulse, making him the rare Facebook grandpa who made good. We know he is an exceptionally underqualified public servant, even by today’s standards, an emblem of the Republican Party’s desperation to recruit Black spokesmen. We know he is one of the legitimate would-be heirs to whatever Trumpism-after-Trump looks like, and at a time when Black male voters appear to be drifting rightward. We have heard he came out of nowhere in the proverbial sense, but “nowhere” is not a place. In America in 2024, it is where Trump draws much of his strength: a spiritual outpost of the aggrieved, the disaffected, the tear-it-all-down. Mark Keith Robinson was born on August 18, 1968, the second-youngest of his mother’s ten children and one of five she had with his father, an alcoholic carpenter. When Robinson was 1 year old, his father struck his mother with the butt of a gun, so she called the cops and ran away to her mother’s house for protection. Robinson’s father was thrown in jail while he and his siblings lived in foster homes for five months. Then his parents reconciled, and the beatings resumed inside their claustrophobic red house on Logan Street, on Greensboro’s Black east side. The abuse was routine and paralyzing — Robinson never felt like he could intervene because he was a child, and his dad’s authority was absolute. Their home was infested with rats, he wrote on Facebook, and he bought groceries using food stamps, which some of the richer kids taunted him for at school. The sting lasted into adulthood; one tormentor ended up working a concession stand at an event where he was campaigning. “I had to remind myself that this woman was now fully grown,” he wrote in his memoir. He ate frequently at the F.W. Woolworth’s on South Elm Street where, in 1960, four students from nearby North Carolina A&T State University, a historically Black institution, launched what became known as the sit-in movement by dining at the then-segregated lunch counter, enduring torrents of abuse until the proprietors agreed to integrate. Robinson has said he knew nothing about this fractious history in his youth. In 1979, he seems to only have been vaguely aware of another racial dustup that happened after an undercover federal agent caught wind that white supremacists were planning to attack communists at a planned anti-Klan march. The police did nothing to prevent the violence and five people died — a tragedy, Robinson later decided, because the most “amoral people in the American political arena” had tried to involve Black locals. He was talking about the communists. When Robinson was a preteen, his father died of what his family believes was cirrhosis. The upheaval was liberating, but also a little scary. Robinson’s father was so jealous he did not allow his wife to attend church for fear she would meet another man, so church is precisely where she started taking her children after his death. St. Stephen United Church of Christ abuts a sprawling lawn across from a public-housing project within walking distance from the family’s little red house. There, Robinson met some of his earliest role models: a former A&T professor who became like a surrogate father to him, a tall ex-Marine whom he idolized, and the austere-looking pastor with the black mustache, George Gay. His mother also had to work for the first time, and a friend hooked her up with a custodian gig at A&T across from the home on Dudley Street they were renting. As a teenager at Grimsley High School, Robinson looked up to Vietnam War veterans and TV cowboys and relished the shiny brass buttons on his JROTC uniform. But his seven-year stint in the U.S. Army Reserve, including training as a field medic, proved a debacle. “I don’t want to go,” he bluntly announced to his recruiting officer, when he was already set to join the Army. He soon enrolled at A&T, a move he did not feel ready for. “I could see great things around me,” he wrote years later on Facebook, “but they never seemed to be FOR me.” He dropped out of college after one semester, got a job at Sbarro, met Yolanda through a friend, and in 1989 she became pregnant. Like many struggling couples in the decades between Roe and Dobbs, they felt unprepared to become parents and were able to postpone that responsibility by having an abortion. They got married soon after, and by the early 1990s had two children, Dayson (named after Robinson’s father) and a daughter, Kim. Robinson bounced from job to job, often on the floor of local furniture-manufacturing plants, and settled into what seemed bound to be a life of fitfully employed anonymity. Robinson credits his political awakening to reading Rush Limbaugh’s 1992 book The Way Things Ought to Be, which made him realize that he had been a conservative “since I was a child,” he claimed in a Facebook remembrance video he made after Limbaugh died in 2021. He had assumed Limbaugh was racist because that is how pundits characterized him, but he realized that they in fact believed the same things. What attracted him most to conservatism was how it rejected “woe-is-me” accounts of Black history and instead insisted on seeing Black people as winners of the American lottery. (Look how far we have come!) This seems to have seeded within Robinson an abiding scorn for the welfare state and any talk of reparations. “Rise up and take hold of your freedom,” he wrote on Facebook, “not someone else’s money.” His own problems with money were exceptions to this rule. Around the time he read Limbaugh, Robinson’s job at a local furniture plant dried up and he switched to an $8-an-hour gig at Papa John’s. He made general manager, then left for an aviation company, but couldn’t avoid calamity: He went bankrupt in 1998 and 1999. Filing for bankruptcy offered him and Yolanda much-needed relief as they clawed toward a balanced checkbook — a fresh start on their finances sponsored by Uncle Sam. Yolanda seemed to rescue them for good when she opened a day care in 2000. But within three years, that company, which Robinson quit his aviation job to work for, also went bankrupt, and the bank foreclosed on their house. “I call this our ‘time in the wilderness,’” Robinson writes in his memoir. During times of stress, he coped by retreating into childhood comforts. Professional wrestling was an area of rare accord in his family growing up, and he still unwinds after long days at the General Assembly by watching old highlights on YouTube. But his greatest love was trains — not just model locomotives, which he collected avidly, but the real-life hunks of metal that barrel along America’s 140,000 miles of track. The vastness of this network gave Robinson plentiful opportunities to indulge a borderline-Freudian childhood obsession. In his memoir, he writes at length about lying on the tracks in front of oncoming trains as a child, surrounded by “oil and grease spatter,” and becoming enveloped in their “creosote-and-steel odor” as they screamed overhead. “I sighed in a long ‘ah,’ as adrenaline coursed through me.” One time in high school, Robinson was lagging behind some JROTC buddies as they crossed a series of tracks when he suddenly stopped in front of what he thought was an approaching freight train. His friends shouted for him to move, which by luck he did at the last second — it turned out to be an Amtrak passenger train, which, according to Robinson, at 70 miles per hour traveled much faster than freight. He heard his friends scream in horror and realized they thought he was dead, so he hid in a nearby drainage ditch, then jumped out as they rushed over to inspect what they assumed would be his mangled corpse. They did not think it was funny, but the anecdote illustrated what Robinson felt was a laudable trait in himself — ”the desire to take chances.” His relationship with trains is slightly less torrid nowadays. “I call trains ‘big dirties,’ because they are,” he writes. “They’re big, dirty pieces of equipment.” In his spare time, the lieutenant governor cruises around Guilford County looking for locomotives to follow, and when he spots one begins stalking and talking to it. “There he is right there,” he will say. “There’s a big dirty, and he’s trying to hide from me, but I see him.” His darker idiosyncrasies found a more natural home on Facebook, which he joined in 2007. His initial posts were about professional wrestling, but his political provocations got more attention. In 2009, he spoke at a Greensboro city-council meeting for the first time when officials were debating whether to apologize for the 1979 Greensboro massacre. Robinson argued that “the city is already healed,” because the mayor at the time was a Black woman. He started making memes, which often featured his own glowering visage engaging in imaginary arguments against politicians, and developed an ostentatious style that mixed evangelical moralizing with the insolence of a wrestling heel. “The problem is not our low unemployment numbers,” he wrote in a characteristic response to a statement by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the economy. “The problem is your low IQ.” His career stabilized after he successfully applied to Davis Furniture around 2015, and Facebook became a second home — in equal parts a testing ground for his conservative zingers and a steady drip of validation. Part of Robinson’s appeal was his knack for slaughtering sacred cows around race. He reserved particular ire for the civil-rights movement, despite the fact that his hometown of Greensboro — with its history of sit-ins, student protests, and visits from Martin Luther King Jr. — had served as the movement’s cradle. Near Robinson’s old neighborhood, its legacy is memorialized everywhere you look. The Woolworth’s lunch counter has been preserved as the main exhibit of the International Civil Rights Center & Museum. The likenesses of the four A&T students who led the sit-ins grace the mural outside the Windsor Community Recreation Center, where Robinson played as a child. By contrast, Robinson himself — the state’s first Black lieutenant governor — is regarded as an aberration from this history. “He is a tragic mistake,” said Reverend Nelson Johnson, a survivor of the Greensboro massacre of 1979. The feeling is mutual. On Facebook in 2017, Robinson characterized Black people who believe in collective struggle as suckers. “Maybe they should try God, family, and country,” he sneered. “So many freedoms were lost” to the “so-called civil-rights movement,” he claimed on a podcast in 2018, explaining that integration was a ploy to subvert the free market and arguing that if Woolworth’s refused to feed Black customers they should have simply taken their business elsewhere. He has come to believe instead that the greatest civil-rights issue of our time is abortion. “It is quite possible,” he wrote in 2019, “that the cure for cancer was in the mind of a child that was aborted.” Abortion looms large in Robinson’s self-conception in no small part because he regrets having paid for one. “No one is perfect,” he admitted in a self-exonerating video, “but no one is too far gone to be saved.” That belief in his own capacity for personal salvation is informed by Robinson’s faith, Evangelical Christianity, which he embraced even as he continued attending the church where his mother raised him. The relationship proved untenable — the denomination to which St. Stephen belongs, the United Church of Christ, was born out of a “social gospel” tradition that seeks to improve real world conditions like poverty and inequality. In the early 1960s, St. Stephen housed Freedom Riders on their journey through the South, while today the church is openly supportive of a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy. In the years after his pastor retired, Robinson pulled his family out of its longtime congregation, a move he glossed over in his memoir with an unceremonious parting shot. “The direction of the church started going sideways when the pastor I grew up with, Dr. George Gay, retired,” Robinson wrote of his decision to leave for “more spiritually nurturing pastures.” “They just stopped coming,” recalled Eric Griffin, the current pastor of St. Stephen. Short shrift though he may have given it in the book, Robinson’s departure from St. Stephen was a moment that crystallized one of the dominant themes of his life: loss. He had lost any semblance of a normal childhood to abuse, his father to alcoholism, a job to corporate downsizing, a house to foreclosure, financial independence to three bankruptcies. “Living in that house and in poverty,” he wrote, “I learned more than I ever could have in a private school or on a private jet going to Europe.” But this seems like a forced effort to squeeze his complicated, difficult life into a neat, Horatio Alger–like fable that validated his conservative worldview. In reality, his fuming, impulsive decision to clock out from work and drive to City Hall on April 3, 2018, saved Robinson from a lifetime of losing. Kristie Puckett, a Black progressive lobbyist who was working for the ACLU around the time that Robinson ascended to the lieutenant governorship, caught Robinson outside the Assembly one day and asked for his thoughts on education reform. “He is not smart,” she told me. “He can’t dig deeply into a subject.” She recalled him seeming shocked that she treated him like a normal politician instead of an enemy combatant. He was also disarmingly polite in his confusion, a far cry from the rabble-rouser people see on TV, but he was undoubtedly sincere. “He’s not shucking and jiving,” Puckett said. “He believes this stuff.” If Robinson has any hope with Black voters, with whom he is presumed to have unusual affinity for a Republican, it will probably come from Black apathy toward the alternatives they are being offered. Josh Stein, Robinson’s white Democratic opponent, is the state’s top law-enforcement official, not exactly an enticing prospect for voters who have become the focal point of this election: those who are politically disengaged, skeptical of the system as a whole, and on the fence between Biden and Trump. Puckett is bullish about Robinson’s odds. “I think he is going to win,” she said. “Hell, some of the stuff Mark Robinson say, Black people in my family say.” North Carolina is now a tantalizing test case for a post-2020 social order in which Black men are voting at higher rates for Trump than they had in 2016. The Republican strategy in the state seems straightforward: peel off enough Black male votes, or get enough of them to stay home, to nudge the race into Robinson’s column — far from unrealistic when facing a roughly 50-50 Democrat-Republican electorate and a 30 percent-plus plurality of “unaffiliated” voters who compose a persuadable middle. Early statewide polls show Robinson with a narrow advantage, though history is not on his side. It is a poorly understood reality outside North Carolina that even though Republicans control most statewide offices, and the state itself hasn’t elected a Democrat president since Obama in 2008, the GOP has won only a single governor’s race since 1988. A bipartisan chorus of naysayers see a brewing disaster for Robinson and the Republicans. “I think this year was the last opportunity to elect a Republican governor in my lifetime,” said Dale Folwell, the Republican state treasurer who lost to Robinson in the primary. Folwell recalled once trying to gauge his new colleague’s interest in actually governing. “Those are hours of the day I could never get back,” he said of his meeting with Robinson. “No notes, folds his arms. Occasionally he picks up his phones, probably bidding on model trains.” State Republicans are still haunted by the ghost of Pat McCrory, the lone GOP governor of the last three decades and the national face of HB2, the so-called “trans bathroom bill” in 2016 that restricted local anti-discrimination policies, and barred people from using restrooms in government buildings that did not correspond to the gender they were assigned at birth. Musicians canceled their shows in protest, the NBA relocated its All-Star Game, and NCAA basketball pulled almost two dozen championships, all causing acute suffering for North Carolina’s economy. And McCrory was a dove compared to Robinson, whom many fear will usher in a darker night of pariah statehood. “We just had the prime minister of Japan into North Carolina on a major business trip,” said Robert Orr, a former state Supreme Court justice. “You want Mark Robinson being his host?” Democratic strategists are licking their chops. “Robinson’s brand of extremism,” said Morgan Jackson, who is the chief political adviser for Josh Stein’s campaign, “is basically like spraying bug repellant on the swing voters in suburban North Carolina.” The most recent midterms confirmed that Black Americans still vote Democratic at higher rates than any other racial group. Some politicos even foresee him becoming a drag on Trump’s odds at a time when Biden’s approval ratings are underwater and North Carolina should be a lock for Republicans. “I’m of the firm opinion,” said Paul Shumaker, a longtime GOP strategist, “that Donald Trump will un-endorse Mark Robinson by the time we get to Labor Day.” On a Friday afternoon in April, I visited Robinson’s old church, St. Stephen, an aging structure shaded in earthy browns, and toured its empty, dimly lit halls with Pastor Griffin, George Gay’s successor who has led the congregation since 1997. Toward the end of Gay’s tenure, Griffin told me, the coalition of southern churches that St. Stephen belonged to was roiled by disagreement over whether to allow gay and lesbian people to marry or get ordained as ministers. “Dr. Gay lost some people he considered to be friends,” Griffin said of the late pastor’s support for their cause. St. Stephen was, in other words, a church like any other navigating this increasingly secular age — wrestling with how to balance tradition with modernity, biblical certitude with the ambiguities of real life. And walking its halls, it was evident that Robinson’s dramatic rise over the last six years was not simply that of an opportunist who had traded the sacred (the birthright of the civil-rights movement) for the profane (riding a wave of rancor to personal glory). It was the story of a man adrift who responded to a life of fear and loss with unyielding certainty. Nowhere is that more evident than in the communities he chose to forsake. A few months after Robinson was elected, a Greensboro-based faith leader named C.J. Brinson was attending his 5-year-old son’s soccer game when he spotted the lieutenant governor alongside the pitch. Brinson and Robinson had grown up on the same side of Greensboro and both had addicts for fathers, though Brinson is about 20 years younger. As a student at North Carolina A&T, Brinson had been tapped to train as a community organizer at the Beloved Community Center, a local activist hub led by survivors of the 1979 massacre, and he now organizes rural and working-class North Carolinians around progressive causes. Robinson’s grandson was on the same soccer team as Brinson’s son. “I just told him what I do,” Brinson said. “He said, ‘We should talk.’” It was an unexpectedly cordial exchange, given their opposing beliefs and Robinson’s firebrand reputation, and Brinson, realizing he was in the presence of Black history, snapped a selfie. “That was the extent of it,” Brinson told me, and they went back to watching the game. Not long after, Robinson visited Raleigh’s Upper Room Church of God in Christ, which Brinson described to me as the most radically conservative Black church in the state. “Ain’t but two genders!” Robinson bellowed from the pulpit. “If there’s a movement in this country that is demonic, and that is full of the spirit of Antichrist, it is the transgender movement!” It was the sort of moment that made Brinson think of the photo they had taken. “There’s no way I’ll ever post this,” he said."
21,Chas Danner,Can Will Lewis Survive the Big Mess at the Washington Post?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/can-will-lewis-survive-the-big-mess-at-the-washington-post.html,A guide to the ongoing drama that has rocked the Washington Post’s newsroom and left many wondering if new CEO and publisher Will Lewis can survive at the publication.,2024-06-10T16:37:13Z,"All is not well at the Washington Post, where multiple crises have rocked the newsroom and new CEO and publisher Will Lewis is at the center of all of them. The British media executive, who is the former CEO of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones and the former editor-in-chief of the Telegraph in London, began in January with a mandate from billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to address the Post’s declining readership and revenue. That transition had seemed to be going relatively smoothly until June 2, when editor Sally Buzbee suddenly resigned and Lewis said he was bringing in two of his former colleagues, Matt Murray and  Robert Winnett, to lead a restructured newsroom. Then a series of reports revealed alleged efforts by Lewis to meddle in coverage, at the Post and at NPR, regarding a British lawsuit implicating him in an old cover-up within Rupert Murdoch’s U.K. media empire. Since then, additional allegations have come to light regarding unethical journalism by Lewis and one of the former colleagues he’s hired, Robert Winnett. Below is a guide to the still-unfolding drama. . The New York Times reported Saturday that when Lewis was the business editor of the Sunday Times in 2004, he assigned an article based on fraudulently obtained phone records, according the reporter who wrote the article. The reporter, Peter Koenig, told the Times he believes Lewis gave him the records himself, and almost certainly edited the article: [Koenig recalled in an interview] that Mr. Lewis told him to look into conversations between two businessmen involved in the possible sale of a retail chain. Mr. Koenig said he was given copies of phone records — he believes by Mr. Lewis himself.  “My understanding at the time was that they had been hacked,” Mr. Koenig said.  Armed with the records, Mr. Koenig said, he persuaded one of the businessmen, Stuart Rose — who was then the chief executive of the retailer Marks & Spencer and is now a member of the House of Lords — to give him an interview to explain the calls. The June 2004 article by Mr. Koenig contains down-to-the minute details of Mr. Rose’s phone calls. The article did not say where the information had come from. …  Days later, Marks & Spencer announced that Mr. Rose’s phone records had been hacked. The Times notes that Lewis also authored two articles himself referencing details in the phone records on the same day Koenig’s article was published. Per the report, Koenig: “described Mr. Lewis as a talented editor — one of the best he had worked with. But as time went on, he said Mr. Lewis changed. ‘His ambition outran his ethics.’” The Times also reported that Robert Winnett — Lewis’s former colleague at the Sunday Times and Telegraph, who Lewis has hired to run the Washington Post’s core newsroom starting this fall — wrote a 2002 article for the Sunday Times based on the fraudulently obtained records of British politicians and business leaders, as well. This was before Lewis became the publication’s business editor. The records came from a private investigator, John Ford, who later admitted illicitly obtaining information while working for the Sunday Times, and at one point mentioned regretting his work for what appears to be the same 2002 article written by Winnett. Ford said in a 2018 interview that, “All senior editors and most reporters at The Sunday Times knew that I obtained illegal phone billing data and bank account transactions, almost every week, for stories.” . Late on Sunday, June 2, Will Lewis announced that Washington Post executive editor Sally Buzbee was stepping down and said that two of his former colleagues would be taking top editorial roles at the publication. Former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Matt Murray (who was appointed to that role in 2018 by Lewis) was replacing Buzbee as interim executive editor. And Robert Winnett, the deputy editor of the Telegraph Media Group, would join the Post in a newly created editor role following the 2024 presidential election. (Lewis and Winnett worked together in London at the Sunday Times, and Lewis later hired Winnett at the Daily Telegraph.) Lewis also announced a restructuring of the Post’s editorial operation to take effect later this year, at which point it would be expanded from two newsrooms, news and opinion, to three: “core” news coverage, to be led by Winnett; opinion, to be led by current editorial-page director David Shipley; and a new division, focused on service journalism, social media, and video storytelling aimed at nontraditional news consumers, to be led by Murray. (All three will report to Lewis.) Though Buzbee hasn’t spoken publicly about her departure, the New York Times reports that Lewis offered her the job of leading the new third newsroom, but she saw that as a demotion. The Post’s report on her departure said the same, adding that Buzbee had resisted the timing of the restructuring plan and “the two agreed she should depart, according to two people familiar with the conversation.” In a conference call after her departure was announced, Buzbee told colleagues, “I would have preferred to stay to help us get through this period, but it just got to the point where it wasn’t possible.” Vanity Fair’s Charlotte Klein, who has profiled Buzbee, reports that most people at the Post expected Lewis to eventually replace Buzbee — particularly since he had already been bringing in his own people for C-suite roles — but no one expected her to be replaced in the middle of an election year. . The June 2 shake-up came as a big shock at the Post, and things got tense the next day when Lewis met with staff to discuss the changes, per employee accounts and recorded audio of the 45-minute meeting shared with other news organizations (as well as the Post’s own report). According to NOTUS, employees described it as a “shit show” during which Lewis, repeatedly challenged by questions about the changes, became “extremely defensive,” at times seeming visibly annoyed or exasperated, and was increasingly combative as the meeting went on. A major point of contention from multiple staff members regarding the leadership changes was the lack of diversity. “The most cynical interpretation sort of feels like you chose two of your buddies to come in and help run the Post, and we now have four white men running three newsrooms,” a top reporter said to Lewis. The CEO admitted diversity “wasn’t great” and promised to improve it, but Post employees told NOTUS that he never directly answered whether or not he considered diverse candidates before making his decision. New executive editor Matt Murray, for his part, vowed that diversity would be a “constant commitment” and pointed to The Wall Street Journal’s having it’s most-diverse-ever masthead during his tenure as editor-in-chief. Staff members additionally questioned Lewis about the timing of Buzbee’s departure and his vision for the publication and grilled him for details about how, exactly, the new third newsroom would be staffed and run and what impact that would have on the Post’s other journalism. There were several instances in which Lewis defensively explained to the Post’s staff that the reason he had to make major changes was because the publication just wasn’t getting the job done, as reported in this exchange  by Vanity Fair: At one point Lewis was asked whether he was intentionally bringing in people who come from a different culture than the Post. “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore,” Lewis said. “So I’ve had to take decisive, urgent action to set us on a different path, sourcing talent that I have worked with that are the best of the best.” The Guardian talked to some Post staffers about the meeting as well: Journalists who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said it was seen as a “mask-off moment” in which Lewis, who had initially been welcomed and seen as a “cheerful and self-deprecating Brit” had suddenly turned hard-edged, in effect telling journalists “you guys have fucked up and I am here to save it”. . In the background of all this upheaval at the Post are old allegations that Lewis was involved in a cover-up of the notorious 2011 U.K. phone-hacking scandal that upended Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. The unproven allegations, which Lewis denies, are included in an ongoing lawsuit filed in the U.K. by Prince Harry and other hacking victims. At the time, Lewis worked for Murdoch’s News UK, the parent company of the now-shuttered News of the World, the British tabloid where, for years, journalists hacked the phones of celebrities, athletes, and politicians for exclusive scoops and committed other misdeeds like paying police for information. After the hacking came to light, Lewis was given the job of cleaning up the mess and restoring News Corp.’s reputation. He and a colleague formed the company’s management and standards committee, investigated the hacking and other misdeeds, then provided the names of those responsible to police. Lewis has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the matter and is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. “I did whatever I could to preserve journalistic integrity,” he told the Post in an interview after he was hired as the company’s CEO. Nonetheless, some still believe Lewis helped senior News Corp. executives shield their guilt, as the New York Times explains in a new recap of the old scandal: ﻿“He oversaw the throwing under the bus of journalists acting under standard procedure for decades,” said Dan Evans, a former News of The World reporter who was prosecuted, provided evidence to the authorities and has since called for press reform. “It’s the way things were done” …  In court documents, phone-hacking victims say that Mr. Lewis allowed the deletion of huge volumes of emails that could have implicated senior News Corp figures in the scandal. The lawsuit claims that, on his watch, eight filing cabinets full of potential evidence disappeared. The plaintiffs say that, rather than turning over everything to the authorities, he ignored information that could have implicated senior executives. They assert that he was part of a scheme to fabricate a security threat to justify deleting emails …  Mr. Lewis’s work on the Management and Standards Committee placed him within Mr. Murdoch’s inner circle … But his work on the committee infuriated many staff members at News Corp’s British newspapers. Some believed that low-level reporters had been sacrificed, as Mr. Evans describes it, “to keep his boss out of an orange jumpsuit.” . On June 5, the New York Times reported that in May, Lewis had objected to, but ultimately did not block, a Washington Post story on the hacking lawsuit when executive editor Sally Buzbee informed him about the article — and that the exchange “rattled” Buzbee: [Buzbee] informed Mr. Lewis that the newsroom planned to cover a judge’s scheduled ruling in a long-running British legal case brought by Prince Harry and others against some of Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids, the people said. As part of the ruling, the judge was expected to say whether the plaintiffs could add Mr. Lewis’s name to a list of executives who they argued were involved in a plan to conceal evidence of hacking at the newspapers. Mr. Lewis told Ms. Buzbee the case involving him did not merit coverage, the people said. When Ms. Buzbee said The Post would publish an article anyway, he said her decision represented a lapse in judgment and abruptly ended the conversation.  The interaction rattled Ms. Buzbee, who then consulted with confidants outside The Post about how she should handle the situation … Mr. Lewis did not prevent the article from publishing. But the incident continued to weigh on Ms. Buzbee just as she was considering her future at the paper, according to the two people with knowledge of her decision-making process. The Times also reported that the clash was not the primary reason Buzbee decided to resign. The Post itself subsequently confirmed the Times’ account “with two people familiar with the meeting” and additionally reported that it was the second time such a clash had happened, as “Buzbee had a similar exchange with Lewis in March over a previous story about the case, another person said.” Responding to a reporter at his own publication, Lewis denied trying to pressure Buzbee or that he had violated the traditional firewall separating CEOs and publishers from editorial decision-making: Lewis called the account “inaccurate” and said that he “did not pressure her in any way.” He acknowledged Buzbee had informed him of plans to publish a story but that he was “professional throughout.” He also said he doesn’t recall ever having used the phrase “serious lapse in judgment.” He described a process, which he said was common, of asking about a story and offering thoughts or input “if appropriate,” and making clear that the decision to publish ultimately rested with the editor. “I know how this works, I know the right thing to do, and what not to do. I know where the lines are, and I respect them,” he wrote, adding: “The Executive Editor is free to publish when, how, and what they want to. I am fully signed up to that.” . Semafor’s Max Tani reported on May 22 that shortly after the Post’s story about the phone-hacking lawsuit referencing Lewis was published, newsletter editors were told not to include the story in their newsletters: In an email to some staff Tuesday evening, newsletter chief Elana Zak issued a brief directive with the subject line “don’t distribute this story,” linking to Tuesday’s development. “Please do not put this Prince Harry story in any of your newsletters,” she wrote.  The email contained no additional information explaining why the paper did not want the story included in its newsletters. A Post employee familiar with the situation told Semafor after this story was published that Tuesday’s email was a result of some internal miscommunication between editors.  The Post declined to explain what happened but provided a statement from managing editor Matea Gold: “The Washington Post is committed to covering this topic — and all stories — independently, rigorously and fairly. We had routine discussions about the promotion of this piece across our platforms.” . One day after the Times report came out about Lewis’s meeting with Buzbee, veteran NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik dropped another bomb. He reported that late last year, Lewis had tried to kill his story about the same lawsuit: In December, I wrote the first comprehensive piece based on new documents cited in a London courtroom alleging that Lewis had helped cover up a scandal involving widespread criminal practices at media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloids … At that time, Lewis had just been named publisher and CEO by Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, but had not yet started. In several conversations, Lewis repeatedly — and heatedly —offered to give me an exclusive interview about the Post’s future, as long as I dropped the story about the allegations.  At that time, the same spokesperson, who works directly for Lewis from the U.K. and has advised him since his days at the Wall Street Journal, confirmed to me that an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview. In response to the report, Lewis told the Washington Post that Folkenflik was “an activist, not a journalist” and said that “I had an off the record conversation with him before I joined you at The Post and some six months later he has dusted it down, and made up some excuse to make a story of a non-story.” A Lewis spokesperson also told the New York Times that the conversation between Lewis and Folkenflik was off the record: “When he was a private citizen ahead of joining The Washington Post, he had off the record conversations with an employee of NPR about a story the employee then published.” The spokeswoman said any interview requests with Mr. Lewis after he joined The Post were “processed through the normal corporate communication channels.” Folkenflik denied that the quid pro quo part of their conversation was off the record, per the Post: Folkenflik told The Post late Thursday their off-the-record agreement related to the substance of the hacking case and the story he was reporting, but not “his efforts to induce me to kill my story.” He added that Lewis and a London-based press aide “subsequently confirmed” the nature of the offer in exchanges “that were not placed off the record.” Folkenflik noted that Lewis did not deny the offers. He also responded to Lewis’s claim that he was an activist rather than a journalist, noting to the Associated Press: Certainly journalists at The New York Times, CNN and inside his own newsroom have concluded that what I reported this week about him and previously has been newsworthy. I think that’s the verdict on our carefully reported journalism. He can say what he wants, but that doesn’t make this go away. Folkenflik later reported that Lewis additionally told Buzbee the Post shouldn’t follow the story: Immediately after [my December] article ran, Lewis told then-Executive Editor Sally Buzbee it was not newsworthy and that her teams should not follow it, according to a person with contemporaneous knowledge. … The Post did not run a story. . Per the Washington Post: The Post reported Monday that Lewis had offered Buzbee oversight of the new division of The Post’s newsroom — a position she declined — and that Buzbee had attempted to persuade Lewis to hold off on his reorganization until after the election. On Wednesday, when a reporter approached him to follow up on scheduling an interview, he expressed his disapproval with The Post’s recent reporting on its own leadership changes. When asked Thursday via email to identify inaccuracies in the piece, he replied: “Forgive me, there has been a lot written by various people. You may well have captured this accurately.” . CNN’s Oliver Darcy reported on June 7 that according to a half-dozen Post staffers, morale had “fallen off a cliff” since the leadership shake-up: “It’s as bad as I’ve ever seen it, truly,” one staffer said Thursday, noting that The Post has hit “rough patches” before, but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the Washington outlet is unprecedented.   Lewis’ uncouth dispatching of Buzbee poisoned much of the goodwill he had earned with his employees over the preceding six months … While staffers who spoke with CNN have praised Matt Murray, the former top editor at The Wall Street Journal who will lead the newsroom through the election, they have raised serious concerns about the appointment of Fleet Street veteran Robert Winnett, who will take the reins after the conclusion of the presidential contest. . Late on Friday, June 7, Lewis sent out a contrite memo to Post staffers regarding the tumultuous week that was. “I need to improve how well I listen and how well I communicate so that we call agree more clearly where urgent improvements are needed and why,” he wrote. More readable format of Will Lewis's memo to staff tonight here https://t.co/7ZaSJjHJit pic.twitter.com/UpPAytYgop “There was a lot for us to process at the Newsroom meeting on Monday, so we need more time together to listen and talk it through,” he added, asking staff to sign up for upcoming “Say It sessions” to ask him more questions about the new newsroom or other issues. He also said that, regarding the workforce-diversity concerns raised at the meeting, “I know I cannot just talk a good game, but need to show it. I assure you I will.” The only reference Lewis made to his alleged coverage meddling was to share the Post’s official statement denying he pressured Buzbee “from publishing any stories” and defending his track record as a publisher. But the statement only referenced the New York Times report on his clashes with Buzbee, not the Post’s own reporting on the meetings or the additional reported meddling about the NPR story last year. He did however acknowledge that “trust has been lost”: Here is what I ask of you. I know trust has been lost because of scars from the past and the back-and-forth from this week. Let’s leave those behind and start presuming the best of intent. If we do that, you will see where we are going in a different light. We don’t have to agree about everything but we all are dedicated to building the future of The Post, and mapping our way there together. . Winnett, the deputy editor at the Telegraph, where he once served as Will Lewis’s lieutenant, will take over as de facto executive editor of the Post’s “core” newsroom after the election. The Guardian reports that Winnett has been involved in some past scoops that would never pass muster at a publication like the Post: Winnett was involved in the reported payment of £110,000 ($140,000) for documents exposing British parliamentarians expenses. In the UK, the story led to a large number of resignations, several prosecutions and multiple journalism awards for Lewis and the Telegraph. But a payment of that kind would be seen as a violation of US journalistic ethical codes.  One episode that has received far less attention involves allegations that, while working as a senior reporter at the Sunday Times, Winnett was involved in a covert operation in 2004 involving the trainee reporter Claire Newell, now investigations editor at the Telegraph. According to an account in the book Flat Earth News by Nick Davies, the former Guardian investigative reporter who exposed the hacking scandal, Winnett and a colleague rented an office to manage Newell — then in her early 20s — who had signed up with a secretarial agency that supplied typists for government departments, and fed “secret documents” to the Sunday Times. Newell was arrested, according to a Guardian account at the time, but never prosecuted.  The New York Times reports that Winnett also wrote a 2002 Sunday Times article, based on information fraudulently obtained by a private investigator working for the publication, which Per the Guardian report, Winnett seems to be well respected by colleagues. Steve Bannon is a fan, too: Former colleagues of Winnett described him as a skillful operator, driven by the desire to dig up dirt, rather than a distinct ideology. “He’s a news person,” said one. “Someone you want in charge in a crisis.” A colleague said he was a major loss to the Telegraph, adding: “He’s a very nice guy, extremely sharp, understated and a very good journalist.” Several also noted the closeness between Lewis and Winnett, with one former colleague saying: “He’ll carry out whatever Will wants him to do.”  In an endorsement that would probably make Post journalists blanch, Winnett’s appointment was seen as a good thing by the rightwing nationalist and Trump ally Steve Bannon, who told the Guardian he was “a great pick to make the fucking thing more relevant and readable”. . One lingering issue is the difference between how newsrooms are run in the U.K. versus the U.S. Politico Playbook notes that Lewis’s Fleet Street attitude seems to be triggering some culture shock at the Post: A series of emerging revelations, stemming from his announcement Sunday that executive editor Sally Buzbee would be leaving, to replaced by two close Lewis associates, have left the Post newsroom “uniformly horrified,” in one reporter’s words.  More consequentially, they have revealed that the clash between Lewis’ rough-and-tumble sensibilities and the Post’s more high-minded culture is even more profound than previously suspected: He can’t seem to figure out where his Fleet Street smarts are necessary and refreshing, and where they are toxic and self-defeating.  Inside the Post, the conversation among reporters surveyed Thursday night centered on whether Lewis could continue leading the publication. The Financial Times pointed out that Lewis’s leadership style is quite normal in the U.K.: While Lewis’s words rattled the Post newsroom, the tone will be familiar to anyone who has worked at a British newspaper. Blunt words and savage autopsies over the day’s coverage in news meetings were common when Lewis and Winnett were forging their careers. Some executives compare Lewis’s actions with those of [Emma] Tucker, whose glass-walled office was last month covered with Post-it notes as Wall Street Journal staff protested against job cuts and restructurings. Both Tucker and Lewis previously worked for the Financial Times.   The other clash is about the Post’s general ethos, as former Post media reporter Paul Farhi explains at the Daily Beast: What I learned in [my 36 years at the Post] — what was reinforced on a near-daily basis — was the Post’s fidelity to basic journalistic principles, such as fairness and accuracy. High on this list was the necessity to avoid conflicts of interest, actual or perceived. Reporters weren’t supposed to march in political rallies, put up yard signs for candidates or contribute in any way to them, lest it suggest partisanship …  Buzbee was not always a popular figure among the Post’s rank and file, but her dedication and integrity were never questioned. The circumstances of her unceremonious departure made her an object of sympathy among many staffers, and surely will leave some lingering sore feelings.  But the suspicion and cynicism surrounding Lewis may linger longer. The events of the past few days have made staffers wonder: Does Lewis get the fundamental principles and codes the Post has tried to live by for decades? Does he want to remake the Post’s business fortunes at the price of its hard-won reputation? Longtime media columnist Jack Shafer notes at Politico that it has seemed as though Lewis somehow doesn’t understand how reporters think: Whether you believe the reporting from the Washington Post, the New York Times and NPR or you believe Lewis, he seems to know squat about how to talk to reporters — especially considering his long-tenure as a top reporter and editor in England before moving over to the business side.  Lewis had to know coming into the Post job that the phone-hacking subject could not be avoided, despite his blanket refusal to discuss it again. Now, he may be completely innocent of any misconduct in the phone-hacking, and all the reporters are being busybodies. But reporters rarely take no for an answer.  If he expects to lead an institution whose remit is accountability, he must expect reporters — both those who work for him and those who work for other publishers — to demand answers. Dropping the subject down the memory hole or deterring the Post from writing about it was never a serious option. Can he possibly be that dense? At the Guardian, former Post columnist Margaret Sullivan writes that Lewis has, for now, lost the newsroom: I worked at the Post as media columnist from 2016 to 2022. I know my former colleagues to be top-flight and much of their journalism to be essential. They are also nimble and, in general, not resistant to change. They fully understand that we’re in a challenging new era. But they also are tough-minded journalists who demand to be treated with transparency and honesty and respect.  Journalists don’t delude themselves that newsrooms are democracies; they know they don’t get a vote. But successful newsrooms aren’t dictatorships, either. If Lewis is going to be successful in his quest to make the Post soar again, he’ll need to have the journalists with him all the way. Right now, they’re not. And that means a course correction is in order. This post has been updated throughout.

22,Ed Kilgore,Polls Say Trump Is Just as Popular Post-Conviction,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/polls-trump-popular-post-conviction.html,Polls of the impact of Trump’s criminal conviction on his popularity indicate very little change. He’s a very unpopular candidate facing a very unpopular incumbent in Joe Biden.,2024-06-10T21:30:36Z,"Most of the scrutiny of the public-opinion reaction to Donald Trump’s criminal conviction has focused on two optics: What do voters say and think when asked about it (either before or after the jury’s guilty verdict was announced)? And how does it affect his standing against Joe Biden in general-election polls? These two angles on public opinion are valuable but hardly dispositive. Public understanding of the highly technical charges against Trump and their relevance to his fitness for the presidency is understandably limited. And at any given moment a thousand influences are affecting the Trump-Biden race. So it’s worth taking a separate look at the metric that you’d expect to most directly be affected by a criminal conviction: Trump’s own popularity. A decent number of pollsters regularly test the “favorability” of major public figures, which is the closest we can get to a “popularity” measure. (For those currently in office, a “job approval” rating offers additional data.) In the RealClearPolitics polling averages, Trump’s favorable/unfavorable ratio on May 30 was 43 percent favorable to 54 percent unfavorable. As of June 10 it is also 43 favorable to 54 percent unfavorable. Looking at specific pollsters, Yahoo News showed Trump’s favorability actually improving between mid-May (43 favorable to 56 percent unfavorable) and early June (46 favorable to 53 percent unfavorable. Economist/YouGov showed a very slight change between late May (44 percent favorable to 55 percent unfavorable) and early June (44 percent favorable to 55 percent unfavorable); the same is true of Morning Consult’s tracking poll (44 percent favorable to 53 percent unfavorable pre-conviction; 43 percent favorable to 53 percent unfavorable post-conviction). Data for Progress does show a lower post-conviction Trump favorability ratio (43 percent favorable to 56 percent unfavorable) than in its last such poll, but it was all the way back in March (45 percent favorable to 54 percent unfavorable). All in all, it’s pretty clear Trump is as popular (and unpopular) now as he was before he became a convicted criminal. You could also take a look at Biden’s favorability numbers to understand why this is a close presidential contest with Trump slightly ahead. Biden’s favorable/unfavorable ratio in the RCP polling averages is 41 percent favorable to 55 percent unfavorable. Reflecting the fact that Uncle Joe is more popular as a public figure than as a president, his favorability rating is regularly a bit higher than his job-approval rating (currently at 39.8 percent at RCP and 37.6 percent at FiveThirtyEight). It’s entirely possible that it will take a while for Trump’s conviction to sink in, and the Biden campaign will work hard to make sure not a single voter is unaware of it by November. But the more it’s Democrats alone who are talking about it, the more Republicans will believe (without actual evidence) Trump’s spin that the state trial in Manhattan was somehow engineered by the Biden administration. A fresh CBS poll shows an incredible 80 percent of Republicans already buying that conspiracy theory. While in a contest as close as this one almost any factor could contribute to a W or L for either candidate, it’s increasingly apparent that Trump’s criminal conviction is likely to matter only on the margins, if at all.

23,Margaret Hartmann,Rudy Giuliani Is Giving Batman Villain in His New Mug Shot,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/rudy-giuliani-new-mug-shot.html,Rudy Giuliani is giving Batman villain in his new mug shot. Trump’s former lawyer opted to smile and leer in his new booking photo from the Arizona fake electors case. He also dramatically declared that he’s ‘very proud’ of his alleged misdeeds.,2024-06-11T16:33:01Z,"“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain” is a Harvey Dent line from The Dark Knight. This doesn’t really apply to most people’s lives, but nerds like to quote it because its sounds cool as hell. However, there is one actual human who embodies this quote to an uncanny degree: America’s Mayor turned indicted co-conspirator Rudy Giuliani. It’s taken Giuliani some time to fully embrace his identity as a real-life Batman villain. Here’s his first mug shot from August 2023, when he was charged in Georgia along with Donald Trump and 17 other people for allegedly being part of a criminal enterprise aimed at overturning the 2020 election results. He looks like a normal guy who’s plastered a resolute look on his face, though his election lies are finally catching up with him. Now take a look at Giuliani’s second mug shot from Monday, when he was booked in the Arizona fake-electors case (he pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges last month): The smile! The downcast leer! The cartoonish star tie! It’s saying, “Wait’ll they get a load of me.” After posting a $10,000 bond and getting fingerprinted, Giuliani even capped off his Phoenix court appearance by declaring he has no remorse about his alleged misdeeds. “Do you have any regrets about what you did in Arizona after the election?” a reporter asked. “Oh my goodness, no,” Giuliani replied, chuckling. “I’m very, very proud of it!” Reporter: Do you have any regrets about what you did in Arizona after the election?Giuliani: No. I’m very very proud of it. pic.twitter.com/PFUZrDApPj They can try to lock Giuliani up, but I have a feeling it will only result in him breaking out of Arkham Asylum with a crew of supervillain buddies and finding new ways to terrorize Gotham.

However, Martha-Ann does not like flags if they are gay. On Monday, documentary filmmaker Lauren Windsor posted a recording she took at a black-tie event last week at the Supreme Court in which she complained about a neighbor’s Pride flag. “You know what I want?” Martha-Ann says on the recording. “I want a Sacred Heart of Jesus flag because I have to look across the lagoon at the Pride flag for the next month.” Instead of the religious banner, she proposed another idea — a sort of anti-Pride flag with a white background and yellow and orange flames that reads “shame” in Italian. Unaware that she was being recorded, Martha-Ann Alito said more. Windsor, pretending to be an ally, offered words of support to Alito, who said that if reporters come “back to me, I’ll get them. I’m gonna get liberated, and I’m going to be okay.” Windsor then said that the “whole Appeal to Heaven flag thing was bullshit” — referring to the flag with far-right associations the Alitos flew over their home. “Look at me; look at me,” Martha-Ann Alito said. “I’m German, from Germany. My heritage is German. You come after me, I’m going to give it back to you.” Alito already made it quite clear in a letter last month that he is not thrilled by his wife’s flag-flying behavior and the inconvenience it has created in his life. (He has also made it pretty clear that he will not defend his wife when a neighbor calls her “a cunt.”) In the recording, Alito’s makes his opinion clear again. “Oh, please don’t put up a flag,” he says in response to his wife’s plan to counterprogram the Pride flag. Later, Martha-Ann stands her ground. “He never controls me,” she says. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
25,Will Leitch,Caitlin Clark Shouldn’t Be on Team USA Just Because She’s Popular,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/team-usa-wont-add-caitlin-clark-just-because-shes-popular.html,"The WNBA’s enormously popular Caitlin Clark didn’t make Team USA’s roster for the Olympics, and some are arguing she should have been added to the team for marketing reasons. That’s not what sports are about.",2024-06-11T11:00:51Z,"Last week, when USA Basketball announced its roster for the upcoming Paris Olympics, there was one name conspicuously absent: Caitlin Clark. This led to the predictable, exhausting pseudo-debates that come up every time Clark is involved with anything. And it should be said once again that Clark herself has studiously and consciously excluded herself from all these debates, something that few of her most intense defenders seem to notice or care about (and of which I will confess having little desire to be dragged back into). But what was most telling about those lambasting USA Basketball for not choosing Clark was the rationale they often used. The argument was not that Clark was one of the 12 best women’s basketball players in the country — which she might be, or may soon be — but that USA Basketball was missing out on a vital marketing opportunity. The most succinct version of this argument, written by someone who has covered countless Olympics and is a longtime and deeply respected advocate for women’s basketball, came from sportswriting legend and Red Smith Award–winning USA Today columnist Christine Brennan: With Clark continuing to set records for TV ratings and attendance in her first eye-popping month in the WNBA as she did in NCAA basketball, it would have been inevitable: she would catapult U.S. women’s basketball to a place it so richly has deserved but has never attained — coverage from broadcasters and news organizations not just in the U.S. but around the world, headlines every day, and most important, vastly increased respect from a still male-dominated international sports media that has for decades focused almost exclusively on the U.S. men’s basketball team rather than the women, who are so good they haven’t lost since 1992. Brennan’s argument, as you’d expect, is well reasoned, thoughtful, and persuasive, from the perspective of someone who has seen women’s basketball ignored for decades and is justifiably excited to see the increased spotlight that Clark brings to a sport that she (and millions of others) love. But it is based on a premise that is anathema to the entire notion of sports — that major decisions, whether they be roster construction or playing-time management, should be driven by marketing factors more than competitive ones. For as long as sports competitions have existed, the goal has always been simple: to win. There are many other things to love about sports, but in the end, winning is what teams, players, and fans really care about. This is not to say that marketing has never been a part of sports. Michael Jordan ushered an entire generation of athlete–as–celebrity front man industry leaders, and there isn’t a team, league, or network that doesn’t consider marketing in its decisions. My baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals, is infamous for bringing in franchise legends like Albert Pujols and Matt Carpenter late in their career primarily for nostalgia purposes. But the understanding was always clear: They better hit, or they’re gone. Winning is the only thing that matters — it’s what makes sports sports. The notion that a team should revolve its roster decisions for the Olympics — the biggest event in women’s basketball — around who is the most marketable is very new. It seems to be driven by the attention economy of the world outside sports, other scoreboards where follower counts matter, or page views, or TV ratings. It’s part of the increasingly pervasive American view that what matters is not the quality of one’s work, but whether it can be sold. Why would Team USA not feel obliged to add Clark to the team? Well, maybe because it’s one of the best sports teams in the world. The U.S. women’s basketball team is 70-3 all-time in the Olympics and has won seven straight gold medals. It hasn’t lost a single game in any tournament since 2006. It is difficult to find any team playing any sport on the globe that has been more dominant over a two-decade span than the U.S. women’s team. They know what they’re doing. USA Basketball knows how to build a winning team, and picking an enormously popular player, who has only been in the WNBA for a couple of months, primarily because she’s enormously popular is not the way it has ever done it. They are trying to win a gold medal. That is supposed to be the point. Sports leagues are occasionally seduced by the outside world of marketing, particularly with today’s influencer culture: The NBA has hired “content creator” correspondents to “cover” this year’s NBA Finals. Mr. Beast even sponsored the Charlotte Hornets’ jersey this season. But these moves always feel more like gimmicks dreamed up by ambitious young marketing associates than anything that moves any sort of needle. These cheap tricks come and go, and the numbers used to gauge their success — whether they’re follower counts or overnight streaming ratings — are never as important or as real as the result on the actual scoreboard. Sports are real. The scoreboard is real, the games are real, the players are real, and all of these real things are judged in real time in front of millions of people. Unlike marketing, sports aren’t about vibes. The people who pick sports teams at the caliber of the Olympic Games aren’t thinking about marketing, nor should they. Because if you lose at the Olympics, most people will care a lot less about how well marketed you were than the fact that you lost.

26,Jen Wieczner,Are Democrats Pivoting on Crypto?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/are-democrats-pivoting-on-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto.html,"There are are signs that they are, with an eye toward the November election: “There are millions of voters who are going to vote against Biden on the basis of this issue.”",2024-06-11T10:00:09Z,"On a warm evening in late September 2023, Mike Novogratz, the billionaire hedge funder turned crypto investor, walked into a restaurant in Washington, D.C. In town from New York, the CEO of Galaxy Digital had spent the day on Capitol Hill visiting with Congress as part of a contingent of crypto entrepreneurs — most of them young people of color — organized by industry giant Coinbase to send a message to Democrats at a moment when crypto was increasingly seen as a Republican cause. Some key lawmakers hadn’t even shown up to the meetings. “I’m a Democrat, and it’s incredibly frustrating that they don’t see crypto as progressive,” Novogratz, an outspoken progressive who has donated millions of dollars to the party, including to Joe Biden in 2020, told me. One Democrat was causing more frustration than any other: Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He had spent the bulk of his tenure in the Biden administration attacking crypto, rejecting the need for new industry regulations, suing or threatening a wide swath of crypto companies, and blocking new products like crypto ETFs. And much of the party seemed to be taking their cues from him. “Gensler is becoming a real problem for our industry,” lamented Novogratz of his former Goldman Sachs colleague. “Part of me wants to take him by the neck and crack it. And I probably would, but I don’t want to get blood on my nice suit.” He gestured to his cream-colored attire. Now, nine months later, many elected Democrats have done a legislative version of what Novogratz had in mind and offered a meaningful (if partial and hardly unanimous) rebuke of Gensler and the faction of the party — led by Senator Elizabeth Warren — that has been fiercely anti-crypto. In May, the Senate voted 60-38, including 11 Democrats and independent Kyrsten Sinema, to roll back an SEC accounting rule for digital assets, defying a veto threat by President Biden. (The bill would have allowed financial institutions to hold crypto on behalf of customers without having to account for it on their balance sheets, treating it the same way as traditional assets.) Chuck Schumer voted for it, an unusual move by the Democrat and Senate majority leader in that he effectively bucked the will of his party’s leader. So did Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Ron Wyden. Then, a week later, 71 Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, helped pass the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, in the House, against the opposition of Gensler’s SEC and the White House — a historic event in that it was the first successful vote for a bill that sets out to regulate cryptocurrency at all. Both measures were actively supported by crypto-industry lobbying groups. Late in the evening on the last Friday in May, Biden followed through on vetoing the Senate measure, but the parallel actions by both houses of Congress on two separate pieces of legislation unmistakably signified the moment when the Democrats ceased to be a straightforwardly anti-crypto party. “In terms of the public policy, Gary Gensler is just wrong about this,” Congressman Wiley Nickel, a North Carolina Democrat who co-sponsored the House bill, told me. He hoped the vote (regardless of the bill’s fate in the Senate) would signal that many Democrats do not share the beliefs of Gensler and Warren. “If Biden allowed Gary Gensler to be the only voice on this, he definitely would lose a significant number of votes,” Nickel added. “If the Democratic Party were the party opposed to web3, to blockchain and crypto, we would only lose votes.” Then on May 23, another surprise twist complicated the picture even more. After initially signaling that it would block a slate of new financial products (called ETFs, or exchange-traded funds) that would allow average investors a much easier route to purchase ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, the SEC suddenly — and, to many observers, shockingly — flipped and approved eight of them, including one from Novogratz’s company. “The sense is that the tone from the SEC has just changed literally overnight,” Emilie Choi, the president and COO of Coinbase, said at a conference just before the approval. “Probably the administration sensing some panic, I guess.” There were signs that in the weeks leading up to these developments, Democrats had indeed begun to panic about the political implications of being pegged as hostile to crypto. Probably not coincidentally, this occurred after Donald Trump announced that his campaign would accept donations in crypto and that he would “build a crypto army moving the campaign to victory on November 5th!” At a campaign event for holders of Trump’s NFTs at Mar-a-Lago in May, the former president called up Ryan Selkis, an influential crypto entrepreneur who had previously voted for Biden, to speak at the podium, and Selkis threw his weight behind Trump. Well…I didn’t expect to share that I was in Mar-a-Lago tonight, but President Trump spoke very highly about crypto and then…invited me and @MihailoBjelic on stage to say a few words.Fight for crypto.Support President Trump. pic.twitter.com/bPAnvFlxMp “All of a sudden, the Democrats in crypto, the tenor of their conversation on the Hill and their friends in the White House, changed. It went from ‘Guys, you really should pay attention to this’ to ‘Oh my God, we’re going to lose,’” says a person close to the industry. “You’ve listened to Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren for so long, and now we’re backed into a corner.” Warren, of course, has been a chief enemy of crypto for years, making her belief that the industry is primarily a scam a core part of her platform. In a campaign ad last year, she included the Politico headline “Elizabeth Warren Is Building an Anti-Crypto Army.” Pressure had been building on Democrats to extend an olive branch to crypto supporters for months. A Coinbase-backed pro-crypto super-PAC called FairShake, which has raised nearly $100 million this election cycle, helped defeat Katie Porter in the California Senate primary in March, running attack ads against her for being an ally of Warren’s. Recent polls showed that 20 percent of registered voters have owned crypto, amounting to some 35 million Americans, disproportionately made up of young Black men — an important cohort to Democrats. “That’s a very sizable group, and a lot of them are single-issue voters,” says Nickel. “And they were being organized, and real money, material money, was going into it,” says a veteran Democratic strategist. “This is one of those issues that there’s no one really against it. You’re not going to pick up any new votes for being against crypto,” says the strategist. “There’s only upside politically and policywise to be for it, and only downside politically and policywise to be against it.” The crypto landscape has also changed recently. While many in Washington had believed — or hoped — crypto would simply die and disappear after the collapse of FTX and the incarceration of Sam Bankman-Fried, the opposite proved true: Bitcoin recently traded at all-time highs thanks in part to new bitcoin ETFs, approved by Gensler’s SEC in January, that made the cryptocurrency more accessible to regular Americans. Yet the SEC and Congress had yet to lay out a regulatory path for the industry to operate legally, nor had they enacted much in the way of practical protections for consumers. Frustration was growing among Democrats that they had fumbled the issue in a way that might even cost them a meaningful number of votes in 2024. “The approach that both Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren have advocated, refusing to regulate the technology on the grounds that that will be the best way to kill the technology, no longer makes any sense — it’s a failed policy,” says a person who has worked in prior Democratic administrations. “Based on our polling, there are millions of voters who are going to vote against Joe Biden on the basis of Gary Gensler’s approach on this issue. With democracy on the line, that’s just a phenomenally irresponsible approach to take.” While Congressional Democrats were reluctant to admit that Trump’s pivot from a not particularly crypto-friendly first term had played a role in how they got a higher-than-expected number of their peers to vote for legislation favored by the crypto industry, Washington lobbyists and crypto advocates said it seemed to break the dam. “The shift is due to a long-term engagement effort by industry with congressional Democrats. The landslide is due to one person: President Trump,” Selkis told me. “The president broke Elizabeth Warren’s evil spell over the Democrats in the Senate, House, and White House.” Whether the White House will adopt a friendlier crypto stance before the election is still something of a mystery. There are signs that a shift is in progress, though. Notably, Biden did not threaten to veto the House legislation the way he did the Senate measure, saying instead that while he opposed it, he was “eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets.” (Justin Slaughter, the policy director for Paradigm, a crypto VC firm that has been one of the most active industry players in Washington, called it “the most positive statement by this or any White House on crypto, ever.”) This is the most positive statement by this or any White House on crypto, ever.The key phrase is “The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets” & also states importance of developing them in US. https://t.co/zrG6X8Hzjy Biden’s late-Friday veto of the Senate bill followed a flurry of efforts by Democrats in Congress to talk him out of it, including coming up with alternative paths to give Biden an out without going back on his word. Nickel, for one, told me he hoped Gensler would just withdraw the rule altogether. There is significant skepticism within the party about whether Biden’s action was the right move. With its anti-crypto tenor, the veto amounts to “political malpractice,” says the Democratic strategist, using a term I heard from other Democrats about the White House’s crypto approach. “I do think the White House, sooner rather than later, is going to make the decision that they don’t want Gary Gensler to potentially impact their ability to win the election. And he has, full stop — he has. Millions of crypto voters are going to vote up or down on this.” Biden just lost the crypto vote. What a stupid, stupid mistake. pic.twitter.com/4pk6nTczTl Even for pro-crypto Democratic voters, though, flipping pro-Trump on this single issue is a huge leap. “There’s a lot of soul-searching happening in the industry, and it is quite complicated for a lot of folks who grew up voting Democrat to think on some level, Why does this guy that I voted for, and this party that I voted for, want to put my industry out of business?” says the person close to the crypto industry. “I’ve seen colleagues wrestle with this.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
27,Jeff Wise,"For a Billionaire, Trump Flies a Crappy Plane",http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/donald-trump-private-jet-boeing-757.html,"Donald Trump flies in a vintage Boeing 757 nicknamed Trump Force One. Not only is it a far cry from Air Force One, it’s a school bus compared to the private jets most other rich people own.",2024-06-11T09:00:21Z,"If Donald Trump gets reelected in November, he’ll win a bonanza of benefits, including freedom from prison, the ability to jail Joe Biden, a $400,000 salary, and kinglike powers. He’ll also get a massive upgrade in the quality of his air travel, from his ’90s vintage 757 dubbed Trump Force One to the real Air Force One, a pair of heavily modified 747s worth billions. To hear Trump tell it, that’s not much of an upgrade at all. He once told Rolling Stone that Air Force One is “a step down” from his 757 “in every way.” But that’s pure delusion. Sure, Trump’s plane is big, and it has a shiny new paint job, but from a true private-jet aficionado’s point of view, those are about its only virtues. “It’s like if you wanted to brag about having a massive yacht, so you bought the Staten Island Ferry and converted it,” says a private-jet broker who prefers not to be identified. “That’s not something that people who really know yachts would find impressive.” Trump Force One, you might say, is a poor man’s idea of a rich man’s plane — a big shiny bauble that behind the scenes is “a plane past its prime with decaying mechanics and exorbitant storage fees,” as CNN put it. Which raises the question: Why is a guy supposedly as rich as Trump is flying around in such a jalopy? According to Bloomberg, he’s worth $6.5 billion. People with this kind of wealth generally fly planes like the Gulfstream G650 or the Dassault Falcon 8X, the Porsches and Lamborghinis of the air. By comparison, Trump is flying a secondhand school bus. It’s not really that complicated, though. To understand the crappiness of Trump’s plane, it helps to know a bit more about planes and Trump. The former and maybe next president’s predilection for slapping his name on superannuated aircraft goes way back. In 1988, he paid $365 million for Eastern Air Shuttle, a division of Eastern Airlines that ran short hops between New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., on a fleet of 17 obsolescent Boeing 727s. Renaming the operation Trump Shuttle, he tried to turn the bargain carrier into a luxury brand, with maple-veneer interiors and free in-flight telephone calls, but the venture defaulted on its debts in 1992 and was repossessed by the banks. Five years later, Trump repurchased one of the 727s for his own personal use and had the interior redecorated in mahogany and silk. It was aboard this plane that his future wife Melania Knauss was photographed lounging in the nude for GQ. Trump kept the plane until 2010, when the earnings he received from The Apprentice allowed him to acquire a much larger plane, a Boeing 757. While a video on Trump’s website called the plane a “luxurious new 757,” it was already decades old when Trump bought it, having first flown in 1991, the year “Marky” Mark Wahlberg released “Good Vibrations.” Already out of production for years by the time Trump bought his, the 757 is an aircraft of a different era. Unlike modern planes, which use computers to control flight surfaces on the wings and tail, the 757 used cables and pushrods. During the first part of its life, N757AF (as it’s known by its tail number) was a workhorse flying for a couple of small discount airlines — Sterling Airlines in Denmark and TAESA Airlines in Mexico — that have since gone out of business. The plane was eventually bought by Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, who turned around and sold it to Trump. If he really did pay $100 million for the plane, as has been widely reported, he overpaid for it even more than he did for the Plaza Hotel. When it was new, Trump’s plane would have cost around $50 million, or $115 million in today’s dollars. But like most vehicles, a plane steadily decreases in value. Based on current used-aircraft listings, a 757-200 of Trump Force One vintage is today worth about $5 to $8 million. After the purchase, Trump hired Long Island’s International Jet Interiors to reupholster the chairs and couches and add mahogany trim and suede paneling. The $250,000 project took six months and involved liberal use of the Trump family crest (which was allegedly plagiarized from Joseph Edward Davies, husband of Marjorie Merriweather Post, the original owner of Mar-a-Lago). Back in the day, Trump’s jet hosted such luminaries as Gary Busey and Dennis Rodman. But after Trump entered the White House in 2017 and started flying Air Force One, N757AF was sidelined and wound up sitting at an airport in the Hudson Valley with one engine missing and the other wrapped in plastic. “The choice to leave it outside at a northeastern airport, exposed to the elements, has baffled aviation experts,” CNN reported at the time. “They note that it’s just a few hours’ flight to warmer, more arid climes. Snow, rain, and moisture can lead to metal corrosion of the airframe and the engines — hard to detect, and, in severe cases, catastrophic.” After Trump left office in 2021, his 757 came out of storage and was flown down to Louisiana, where it received a new exterior paint job that replaced the giant “T” on the plane’s tail with an American flag. “It has been completely modernized and renovated, and looks GREAT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social with a link to a video showing workers at LandLocked Aviation Services of Lake Charles scrubbing, masking, painting, and polishing the exterior to a dramatic orchestral score. Although Trump makes a big deal about the plane’s interior — a TV documentary about the plane from 2013 describes it as having “enough gold that if melted down could gold-plate the outside of a Greyhound bus” — it’s been a long time since it’s had an update. “A 14-year-old interior is probably going to be showing signs of wear and tear,” says the aircraft broker. “Carpets get worn down, leather gets old, veneer gets dinged and scratched and dented.” If Trump were trying to sell it, he says, “most new owners would want to redo it. Redo the leather, redo the wood, redo the carpet. Just bring it into a more contemporary feel.” Its age and decrepitude aren’t the only things working against Trump Force One. Commercial airliners like the 757 are impressive pieces of engineering, but they are optimized for a particular goal (flying a lot of people together economically from point A to point B) that is quite different from that of a private jet (delivering a small number of wealthy people around in a high degree of comfort). As a result, they offer a very different kind of performance. Compared to a top-end private jet like the Gulfstream G650, which cruises at Mach 0.9 at altitudes of up to 51,000 feet, the 757 flies both lower and slower, with a cruise speed of Mach 0.8 and a maximum altitude of 42,000 feet. As a result, it takes longer to get where it’s going and is more susceptible to turbulence from stormy weather. The Gulfstream can also take you farther, with a range of more than 8,000 miles compared to 4,500 miles for a 757-200 like Trump’s. That means that, while the Boeing can cross the Atlantic in a single hop, the Gulfstream can cross the Pacific. Another problem is that Trump’s plane can’t go to many of the places rich people like: Weighing more than 100,000 pounds, it’s barred from landing at the kind of small, conveniently located airports that private jets prefer, like Aspen, Gstaad, and Teterboro. Another feature that private-jet owners care about is the “cabin altitude.” Basically, the lower the cabin altitude, the thicker the air, the easier it is to breathe, and the less likely you are to get a headache. When it’s flying at its maximum altitude, the 757 is able to pressurize its cabin to 8,000 feet, roughly what you’d experience at the base of a Colorado ski resort. When flying at 51,000 feet, the Gulfstream G650 is able to pressure its cabin to 4,850 feet, which is like being in Denver. For a private jet, bigger can still be better if you really need a lot of space. Previous owner Allen reportedly used the jet to fly around sports teams, for instance. And Middle Eastern sheikhs are said to be fond of traveling with large entourages. For Trump, the main virtue of size is that he can use the plane as a billboard, parking it behind himself at rallies as a synecdoche for his wealth. “Buying a 25-year-old 757 is like buying a bag of Cheetos,” an aviation consultant told the New York Times in 2016. “It’s a lot of food for a low price.” As a frequently bankrupt man whose main asset is the carefully nurtured perception that he is a skilled and successful businessman, Trump has mastered the art of flaunting his status symbols even when their shortcomings are evident. Just as he has managed to frame his bankruptcies as displays of business savvy (“We’ll have the company. We’ll throw it into a chapter. We’ll negotiate with the banks. We’ll make a fantastic deal,” he once bragged), he has framed the low-end nature of his aircraft as a reflection of his crafty deal-making. In an interview with the Times in 2016, he said that he liked older planes “because they had been ‘tested’ and had ‘been around.’” Until recently, Trump also owned a much smaller Cessna 750 Citation X, a proper business jet, and two Sikorsky helicopters. His website describes the eight-passenger Citation as a “magnificent aircraft,” adding that “the signature Trump Crest is featured prominently on the exterior adding an even higher level of luxury and beauty to this magnificent aircraft.” In reality, the Citation X is on the small end for a private jet, and Trump’s 27-year-old aircraft was the oldest of its kind in the air. In 2016, the FAA grounded it temporarily after the Times reported that its registration expired. Last year, Trump put it up for sale. Though the plane was widely described in the media as being worth $8.5 to $10 million, Citation Xs of that vintage typically sell for a third as much, and Trump’s was finally purchased last month for just $2.5 million by an Iranian American real-estate developer who had previously given some $250,000 to a Trump-allied political committee. Trump’s helicopters are also long in the tooth. His two Sikorsky S-76B helicopters, built in 1989 and 1992, would be worth about $7.5 million new but are valued at about $800,000 now. Of course, however dilapidated Trump’s fleet of aircraft may be, the mere fact that he owns private jets and helicopters is a clear sign that he remains wealthy. But if he fails to retake the White House, all that could be in jeopardy. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in legal judgments he must pay for fraud and defamation. Depending on how Trump’s various legal and political battles play out, it’s easy to imagine his finances imploding in a way he’s never yet experienced. And if his assets wind up getting repossessed, his aircraft will probably be among the first to go.

28,Ed Kilgore,Is Economic Populism Biden’s Best Hope for Beating Trump?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/economic-populism-biden-best-hope-beating-trump.html,"There’s a strong ‘populist’ bias among Democrats in favor of making economic, as opposed to cultural, arguments. But the country is actually more liberal on social issues, and abortion and democracy are as salient as class warfare against Trump.",2024-06-11T17:42:21Z,"There is an ancient yet still vibrant school of thought in center-left politics that is known as economic populism. It tends to hold that unstinting, class-warfare-style attacks on the wealthy and on corporations are the keys to the kingdom for Democratic politicians and typically envisions a return to the “New Deal coalition” — based on working-class voters who made Democrats the majority party from the Great Depression into the 1980s — as its goal. To some observers, it is an especially tempting option right now, at a time when the Democratic president of the United States is in danger of losing office over economic concerns to a wealthy Republican rival aligned with the interests of his fellow plutocrats. So it’s not surprising to see New Republic editor Mike Tomasky (a shrewd and experienced political observer who also happens to be an old friend of mine) argue that President Biden needs to revive the economic messaging of the 1930s: Biden needs to run a class warfare campaign against Trump and his Mar-a-Lago cronies and make the economic contrast crystal clear, because the differences in economic philosophy between these two candidates is probably greater than any since FDR faced Alf Landon in 1936. Somewhat ironically, Tomasky admits that taking a page from the Democratic messaging of the distant past is essential because Biden can’t run on the economic record he compiled in the immediate past: Biden can’t win an economic argument about the past. In reality, his economic record is strong, and the inflation wasn’t his doing. But very few people know or believe that. Meanwhile, people do believe, preposterous as it seems, that Trump is a successful businessman and was a good economic steward. If swing voters walk into the voting booth thinking about the candidates’ economic records, they’ll vote for Trump. It’s the two candidates’ economic agendas for the next four years, and particularly Trump’s support for more tax cuts for the rich, that Tomasky recommends as Biden’s priority in the last few months of the 2024 presidential contest. He does not, to be clear, recommend shelving Biden’s other arguments about abortion policy and the threat Trump poses to democracy. But he appears (like many other Democrats) to share the populist premise that economic issues matter most and offer the strongest ground for any winning Democrat: The voters who will decide this election care mostly about their bank accounts, and their future. The way to win a majority of them is to make Trump defend a position they strongly oppose. I would challenge both of these premises. First of all, a vote is a vote, and in what is clearly going to be a very close Trump-Biden contest, the “voters who will decide this election” could just as easily be middle-class former Republicans upset about lost abortion rights or January 6 as it could be the legendary white working-class voters who have been sold a bill of goods by Trump. And while Biden and other Democrats should do everything within their power to identify Trump with the deeply unpopular economic-policy views of his Republican allies (and, indeed, of his presidency, once you look at what he actually advocated), it’s important to acknowledge the man is a master of evasion when it comes to confessing to unpopular views. It’s unlikely that Biden will be able to carry with him to a debate podium a copy of the Heritage Foundation’s 1,000-page Mandate for Leadership book laying out a radical agenda for a second Trump administration and hold the 45th president’s feet to the fire on its particulars. The incumbent and his advisers will need to skillfully distill the economic and cultural and constitutional challenges a second Trump term would create in a manner that makes and keeps them front of mind for persuadable voters. Some Democrats are reluctant to focus on noneconomic issues because they, not necessarily voters, find them most compelling. Dating back to the classic populist analysis of Democratic futility — Thomas Frank’s brilliantly written 2004 book, What’s the Matter With Kansas? — you often see a prejudice that “class warfare” issues are the only real issues and working-class voters the only legitimate target for progressive politicians. Compounding that prejudice is the stereotype of the American electorate as progressive on economic issues and more conservative on cultural issues. Indeed, the New York Times’ David Leonhardt asserted this very thing last year: [It’s] arguably the most important fact about U.S. politics: Americans tend to be more progressive on economic issues than they are on social issues. If you can remember that, you will be able to make better sense of the 2024 campaign. As it happens, Gallup has been asking Americans to describe their ideology on economic and on social issues for a very long time, and its latest findings contradict the economic-populist premise: Gallup’s May 1-23 Values and Beliefs survey finds that Americans are currently about equally likely to say their views are conservative (32%), moderate (32%) or liberal (33%) on social issues. Though annual figures have fluctuated, the ideological parity in the latest measure is also reflected in a five-year average of figures from 2020 to 2024 …  Americans are currently most likely to describe their views on economic issues as conservative (39%) or moderate (35%), while about a quarter describe their economic views as liberal (23%).  Like Gallup’s trend on social issues, Americans have become more likely to describe their views as liberal, though this increase has not led to ideological parity as it has on social issues. The peak in liberal economic identification was recorded in 2021, at 25%; it has exceeded 20% for each of the past five years. If, as most progressive folks believe, the fight to keep Trump from returning to the White House is a transcendent cause, then Democrats should go with whatever works, not with any preferred emphasis on economic issues as inherently more salient (or, as some believe, more legitimate). Abortion and constitutional governance are as likely to decide the Biden-Trump competition as the two candidates’ positions on taxes and economic inequality and vice versa. But it’s absolutely true that Biden needs to define his closing argument very soon and stick with it. Trump has no such problems since his candidacy has long since focused on marrying nostalgia for the price levels of the pre-pandemic Trump administration with a future filled with vengeance.

Sign up here to get it nightly. One evening last July, a convoy of SWAT vehicles and police vans pulled to a stop in front of a single-story tan stucco home in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada. To the area’s residents it was an undoubtedly curious scene; Henderson is considered one of the safest communities in America. At the target house, an officer pulled out a bullhorn and began shouting to the people inside. “This is the Las Vegas Metro police department. We have a search warrant for the residence. Come out with your hands up.” Eventually, the garage door rose, revealing Duane “Keefe D” Davis, a 60-year-old Black man with a bald head and a graying beard. Davis was instructed to put his hands over his head and walk backwards down the driveway, where he was detained while officers searched the house. According to court records, the police confiscated everything from 11 .40-caliber cartridges to a Pokémon-themed flash drive. Not long after, Davis was arrested and charged with one the 20th century’s most infamous unsolved crimes: the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. Even for those closest to the case, the news came as a shock. Twenty-five hundred miles away, a former LAPD detective named Greg Kading was in a hotel room in Boca Raton, Florida, when his phone chimed with an incoming text. Keefe’s been arrested, it said. Kading, like Keefe, was 60, and his age had started to show. His brushed-back hair was thinning, his goatee had gone gray, and gravity pulled at the sides of his eyes, softening the hardest features of his face. Until his retirement in 2010, Kading had been a hotshot cop working some of the LAPD’s most complicated cases: racketeering, extortion, murder. He earned a Medal of Valor from the Department of Justice, and reached the LAPD’s highest ranking as an investigator. And yet, for all his experience, he had never expected a text like this to come. Fifteen years earlier, Kading had secured a secret confession from Davis in Tupac’s killing. But at the time, a legal arrangement had barred prosecutors from using the confession in court. Davis had walked free. For years, Kading had lost hope. “I had publicly said, ‘I don’t think that there will ever be an arrest in this,’” he recalled. Now, it appeared that something had changed. “I feel that it’s part of divine intervention,” he told me recently. “Most other people would call it karmic justice.” Alone in his hotel room, Kading pumped his fist into the air, overcome by a heady combination of excitement and relief. The private moment didn’t last long. Within minutes, his phone started ringing and didn’t stop for the rest of the day. National news and niche podcasts alike wanted his expert opinion. Ever since retiring, Kading had spun his experience on the case into a profitable second act that included self-publishing a book, producing a documentary and TV series, and dozens, perhaps hundreds, of podcast and YouTube-channel appearances. His claims to have solved the murders of both Tupac and rival Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G., had made him something of a celebrity in the niche world of hip-hop-related true crime. But with celebrity had also come controversy. As Kading’s profile grew, so did the criticisms from former colleagues who described his police work as sloppy at best and dangerously reckless at worst. Until recently, those squabbles had largely remained the fodder of podcast fanatics and Biggie-Tupac truthers. But Davis’s arrest has changed all that. Kading’s LAPD history is facing renewed scrutiny and legal questions surrounding how the confession he secured from Davis could potentially upend the prosecution’s case. Which presents the question: Could the cop who cracked one of the most notorious cold cases in history also have a hand in its undoing? In December, I visited Kading at his home in Rancho Cucamonga, California, where he had agreed to walk me through his role in the tangled investigation that led to Davis’s arrest. In interviews, Kading can come off as combative; he has a habit of calling his critics “fucking stupid.” But in person, I found him breezily self-possessed. He greeted me warmly in a Hawaiian shirt and set us up to talk around a large felt poker table in a room he’s been converting into a podcast studio. When I asked what he did with his free time, his answer was immediate: golf. It was a far cry from what Kading described as his “wayward youth.” Born in Reno, Nevada, to a pair of casino workers, he was arrested as a teenager for brandishing nunchucks and claims to have taken his first hit of acid at the age of 10. A possible career in law enforcement didn’t emerge until his early 20s after his best friend suffered a spinal-cord injury and Kading returned home to care for him. The friend’s father, a lieutenant with the local sheriff’s department, offered to help Kading get hired as a deputy. “It was never a lifelong dream,” he told me. “It was just a good job.” In 1988, after a ride-along with some cops in Los Angeles, however, he saw the light. “God, this city’s badass,” he remembers thinking. “There’s so much action.” He applied to join the LAPD soon after. It was the height of the city’s gang era. “Today’s victim is tomorrow’s suspect,” was how one L.A. County sheriff’s deputy described his tenure during those years. “It was all hell breaking loose.” At the time, L.A. was averaging a thousand or so homicides a year. Kading thrived in the high-adrenaline world of foot chases and drug busts. “I wanted to be tough or at least feel tough,” he said. Before long, he was recruited into the LAPD’s controversial CRASH anti-gang unit, where he admitted to “manhandling” gang members in a similar manner as the officers who beat Rodney King into submission in 1991. “I loved being a good guy,” he would later write in his memoir, Murder Rap. “And I loved it when the good guys won.” In 1996, when Tupac Shakur was killed after leaving a casino in Las Vegas, Kading barely noticed. He had by then been promoted to the federal task forces investigating L.A.’s biggest and most complicated cases: organized gang activity and drug trafficking, among them. Similarly, the killing of Biggie Smalls in a drive-by shooting outside L.A.’s Petersen Automotive Museum six months later, also failed to register. “It was just like, whatever,” Kading told me. “Some celebrity rapper got killed in L.A.” It wasn’t until nine years later that Kading finally got involved. By then, the Tupac and Biggie murders were already among the most controversial cold cases in American history. The inability of police to crack either case had transformed the pair into symbols of the kinds of institutional failures that could allow two of the world’s most famous Black artists to be struck down in their primes, with no one to answer for it. Las Vegas police would later say that they had a bead on Tupac’s killer within days of the shooting, but that their efforts were stymied by a code of silence among the gang members involved. What they are less likely to admit is that the lead investigators showed up in Compton in clunky cowboy boots and were all but laughed out of the interrogation room by the hardened gangsters they had arrived to question. “They didn’t have a clue,” said Bob Ladd, a former Compton police officer who aided in the Shakur investigation. The investigation into Biggie’s killing was equally inept. Infighting, egos, and conspiracy theories derailed it from almost the beginning, resulting in Voletta Wallace, Biggie’s mother, filing a $400 million wrongful death lawsuit against the LAPD in 2002. She had been inspired by an article in Rolling Stone featuring Russell Poole, one of the lead detectives on the case, who came to believe that rogue cops were responsible for her son’s murder. The lawsuit threatened to bankrupt the police department. “It has nothing to do with dollars and cents,” Wallace said at the time. It had to do with “honesty, integrity, and coverup.” (Wallace declined to speak for this story.) After four years of courtroom battles with Wallace’s attorneys, the LAPD’s top brass eventually concluded that the best way to prove the police hadn’t killed Biggie was to figure out who did. In the spring of 2006, Kading got a call from an LAPD detective named Brian Tyndall asking him to join a resurrected investigation into the superstar’s death. “There’s this big lawsuit going on,” he remembers being told. “We want some outsiders looking at this.” Kading recommended partnering with the feds. Not only could the FBI bring experience and funding, there were also the optics to consider. If the task force found that LAPD officers were not involved, it would undercut Wallace’s case — and with the feds’ imprimatur, it would be harder for critics to write them off. Eventually, a host of other federal agencies also got involved, including the ATF, DEA, and IRS. “There were two different objectives,” Kading explained as we sat around his poker table. “But they could intermingle.” For the next few months, Kading set about collecting all the material from the Biggie investigation into a massive new case file. It was well over 100,000 pages. An entire wall of the task-force offices was devoted to a “murder map” connecting the players, witnesses, and evidence. Suspects and hypotheses abounded. “Our approach was like, everything is true,” said Kading. “All of these theories are potentially true until they’re disproven.” The first avenue of inquiry to examine was Detective Poole’s. In his theory of the case, Biggie’s murder had been orchestrated by Suge Knight, the fearsome head of Tupac’s label, Death Row Records, in retaliation for Tupac’s death. Poole believed that Knight had hired a corrupt LAPD cop and his triggerman friend to do the killing. Kading called Poole’s explanation “simple and elegant.” The fact that Poole was a veteran detective who had dedicated his life and career to the department only added to the seriousness of his claims. “For many involved in the case, he became the ultimate whistleblower,” Kading wrote in Murder Rap. But as he began looking back at the details of Poole’s investigation, what Kading found simply didn’t add up. Despite all the speculation and publicity, no direct evidence was ever discovered connecting corrupt LAPD cops to Biggie’s death. Instead, Kading and his colleagues turned their focus to the other prevailing theory of the case — that Biggie’s murder was a gang hit. In the ’90s, informants had come forward claiming that the Southside Crips had killed Biggie because Bad Boy Records, his label in New York, owed them money for security work on the West Coast. Others claimed Knight had hired his fellow Blood gang members to kill Biggie in retaliation for Tupac’s murder. Untangling the web of gang affiliations and street vendettas that appeared to connect both cases proved particularly challenging. Kading spent weeks combing through old witness statements in an effort to establish a list of targets to re-interview, only to discover that nearly all of the people he identified turned out to be dead: Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson, a Southside Crip suspected of multiple murders, had been shot to death outside of a car wash in May 1998; Alton “Buntry” McDonald, one of Suge Knight’s closest Blood allies, was shot in the chest at a gas station in 2002. “Hen Dog” Smith, “Poochie” Fouse, “Heron” Palmer, the list goes on — all murdered in drive-by shootings. “Just about every investigative lead had been exhausted,” Kading said. The informants that remained seemed intent on throwing the investigation into turmoil. A former Crip named Michael “Owl” Dorrough claimed to know who had shot both Tupac and Biggie, but when members of the task force visited him in Pelican Bay prison he said he would only speak to Tim “Blondie” Brennan, an L.A. County Sheriff’s deputy detailed to the task force. Brennan’s former partner, Bob Ladd, says the insult caused a rift between the other officers that resulted in Brennan leaving the group. “They said they didn’t trust him,” said Ladd. (Brennan died in 2021. Kading said that Brennan’s departure was the result of a promotion, not the task-force dynamics.) Another informant, Robert “Stutterbox” Ross, sent agents across Southern California tracking down a drug runner he claimed was involved in Biggie’s murder, until Kading caught Ross on a wiretap bragging to friends that he had “a cop in his pocket” and was simultaneously running a bizarre scam to extort money from Shaquille O’Neal. By that point, more than a year had passed and the task force had almost nothing to show for it. Cracks were beginning to form among the group. Kading wasn’t technically in charge, but he had essentially commandeered the task force, which frustrated some of the other members, who complained that he had refused requests to interrogate witnesses if he had already decided they were cooperative. Others said he compartmentalized the group, seemingly in order to maintain control. (Kading denies this, saying, “Everyone knew what everyone else was doing. If they didn’t, it was only because they had their head up their own asses.”) Mike Caouette, another former L.A. County Sheriff’s deputy, said that Kading’s management style could be infuriating. “I mean, we laughed, we had a good time, but in hindsight, several things happened and it really, really left a bad taste in your mouth.” Caouette told me that Kading was so obsessed with the notion that “Stutterbox” Ross was Biggie’s killer that he offered Ross immunity if he was willing to admit to the crime. According to Caouette, Ross’s lawyer was a friend of one of his partners and called him after a meeting between Kading and client to ask if a detective, not a prosecutor, making that kind of offer was “standard procedure.” Kading vehemently denies making the offer, and provided the minutes of his meetings with Ross to refute Caouette’s claims. He called them “ridiculous fucking bullshit.” Caouette called him “a pathological liar.” Still, Kading and his colleagues did come to an agreement on the one target that was left to pursue: Duane “Keefe D” Davis. One of the few high-ranking gang members who had managed to escape the bloodshed of the ’90s alive and well, Davis’s name was all over the case file, from chatting up Biggie backstage at the Petersen museum on the night of his death, to his presence in Las Vegas on the night Tupac was killed. And against all odds, Davis was living prosperously in Southern California. Getting him to talk to law enforcement, however, wouldn’t be easy. For that, they would need leverage. From his earliest days growing up in Compton, Davis had reveled in street life. “He was a little punk running around selling dope, trying to make some money like everybody else,” said Ladd, who patrolled the city for nearly 20 years. But after prison stints in the late ’80s and early ’90s, Davis returned to his old neighborhood with supercharged ambition, moving quickly up in the ranks of the Southside Crips, his neighborhood gang, until he was a shot-caller, one of the highest ranking members. According to Ladd, by the mid-nineties Davis was raking in millions of dollars a year running a drug trafficking network that was directly supplied by Colombian cartels. When Kading punched Davis’s name into a DEA database more than a decade later, there was an immediate hit. Narcotics investigators in Richmond, Virginia, had already identified Davis as part of a cocaine-trafficking conspiracy that stretched across the country. Kading offered to work the West Coast half of the investigation with a simple goal in mind: Develop a strong enough drug case against Davis that he would be willing to divulge whatever he knew about Biggie’s murder in exchange for a deal. Things moved quickly after that. Because the Biggie task force had been federalized, piggybacking on the DEA investigation in Virginia was relatively easy. Kading and his colleagues had access to wiretaps and informants, as well as funding for drug buys. They started buying kilos of coke from Davis through a South Side Crip informant who had done deals with Davis before. After a wiretap caught Davis boasting to a drug trafficker in Texas that he also sold “water,” drug slang for PCP, they started buying that too. Getting caught selling a single gallon jug was probably enough to put Davis away for the rest of his life, and, according to Kading, Davis had told the Texan, “Man, I can fill your swimming pool.” We got everything we need on him, Kading remembers thinking. In late 2008, Kading and Daryn Dupree, another LAPD detective on the task force, confronted Davis at his home in Southern California and explained the situation. Sitting in his garage so curious neighbors wouldn’t be alarmed, they told him he was looking at 20-plus years in prison on drug charges, not to mention harsh sentences for the numerous family members and friends who had been swept up in the sting. That is, unless he wanted to talk. About what? Davis asked. “Put it this way,” Kading told him. “We’re homicide investigators.” Within the hour, Davis’s lawyer called looking to discuss a deal. For the first time in more than a decade, a leading figure in one of the gangs rumored to be involved in Biggie’s murder was willing to sit down for an interview. But the question remained: How much did Davis actually know? In an effort to extract the truth, the U.S. Attorney handling the case offered what’s known as a proffer agreement: Whatever Davis told them that day wouldn’t be used against him. In short, he was able to speak freely. In exchange, Davis could get potential leniency for the drug charges looming over him. Faced with spending the rest of his life in prison, there was little for Davis to do except agree. There was only one problem. He claimed he didn’t know anything about Biggie’s murder. “That one wasn’t us,” he kept saying. But meetings kept getting scheduled and Davis kept showing up, so Kading figured he must have something else worthy of the proffer. A few weeks later, in early 2009, his suspicions were confirmed when he ran into Davis in the hallway outside of his lawyer’s office. “I don’t know nothing about what you want to talk to me for,” Kading remembers Davis whispering as they stepped inside. “But what I do know is gonna blow your fuckin’ mind.” Back in 1991, Davis began telling Kading and his colleagues, he was introduced to a famed East Coast drug dealer and club owner named Eric “Von Zip” Martin during a pickup baseball game in Compton. Zip was a hustler extraordinaire who, according to Mike Tyson, once stole $600,000 of cash from boxing promoter Don King through sweet-talking alone. (Zip died in 2012.) Zip and Davis quickly struck up a relationship built mostly on cross-country drug deals, which eventually led to an introduction to another of Zip’s alleged associates, Bad Boy Records founder, Sean “Puffy” Combs. With Biggie’s profile rising, Combs and his star artist were spending an increasing amount of time on the West Coast just as the rivalry between Bad Boy and Suge Knight’s Death Row Records was heating up. At the 1995 Source Awards in New York, Suge Knight had openly mocked Combs in front of a packed audience. A year later, Biggie and Tupac had come face to face in a standoff outside of the Soul Train Awards in Los Angeles, during which Tupac had implored Reggie Wright, Jr., the head of Death Row security, to “Shoot him, Reg! Shoot him!” Davis claimed he offered Combs his Crip soldiers as security during West Coast tours. “Come on, we got your back,” he told Combs over the phone. “Just give me about 45, 50 tickets.” But according to Davis, Combs took the relationship one step further. During a stop on the 1995 Summer Jam tour in Anaheim, Combs allegedly told a hotel room full of Crip gangsters — Davis included — that he wanted “them dudes’ heads,” as Davis put it; i.e. for someone to kill Tupac and Knight. Combs may have simply been caught up in the moment; tensions were running high and he was by all accounts legitimately concerned for his safety. But later, Davis said, over lunch in L.A., Combs offered him a million dollars to get the hit done. According to Davis, he had agreed to the hit, telling Combs, “Man, we’ll wipe their ass out quick.” (Davis later told Kading he would have done it for $50,000.) Kading and his colleagues were astonished. Had they heard that right? Tupac’s killing was a murder for hire? No, Davis replied. The trip to Vegas was meant to be a purely social one. Mike Tyson was fighting for the heavyweight championship that night and Davis had traveled there along with his nephew, Orlando Anderson, and a handful of other Crip associates to take in the spectacle. After arriving, they partied and drank champagne before heading to the MGM Grand arena where they watched Tyson dismantle his opponent, Bruce Seldon, in under two minutes. It was then that the outing took a perilous turn. After the fight, Anderson briefly found himself alone in the lobby of the adjacent casino when Trevon Lane, a Blood gangster known for his connections to Knight, recognized Anderson as the Crip who had tried to steal his diamond-studded Death Row necklace during a scuffle at a mall a few months earlier. Rumors had been swirling on the street ever since that Combs was offering a bounty to anyone who could bring him one of the chains. Lane pointed Anderson out to Tupac, who was in town with Knight to watch the Tyson fight. Tupac rushed across the floor and asked Anderson, “You from the South?,” a reference to Anderson’s Southside Crip allegiance, then punched him in the face, dropping Anderson to the floor where he was set upon by a crew of Bloods. Davis was sitting in a nearby restaurant when word got back that his nephew had been attacked. “The shit became ominously personal,” he would later write in his 2019 memoir, Compton Street Legend. Street code demanded that Anderson retaliate for the public beating, but because the visit to Vegas had been strictly social, Davis and his crew hadn’t brought any guns. That was where Zip came in. He had also arrived in Vegas for the fight and, according to Davis, offered up a .40-caliber Glock he had hidden in a secret compartment in his Mercedes-Benz. “He said it’s perfect timing,’” Davis recalled Zip telling him. For the next hour and a half, two cars’ worth of Crips staked out Club 662, a Knight-owned venue where Tupac was meant to perform, but the rapper never showed. Nearly giving up on the hit altogether, one of the cars headed home, leaving four in a white Cadillac that the entourage had rented for the occasion: Terrence “Bubble Up” Brown, the driver; Davis in the front passenger seat; and an associate named DeAndrae “Big Dre” Smith alongside Anderson in the back. When Tupac didn’t show, they drove back toward the Strip on East Flamingo Road. Just after 11 p.m., Davis spotted Tupac up the street, near the intersection with Koval Lane, leaning out of the passenger side window of a black BMW that was being driven by Knight. As Tupac chatted up some girls in a passing car, Bubble Up hit the gas, sliding the car into the far-right lane, while Davis handed the Glock to Anderson in the back. As both cars slowed at the corner, Anderson reached across Big Dre and fired out the open window, hitting Tupac four times — two in the chest, one in the arm, and one in the thigh. He died in the hospital six days later. Knight, in the driver’s seat, was hit in the head by bullet fragments. Kading instantly recognized how incendiary Davis’s story really was. Not only had he detailed the events behind Tupac’s shooting and confessed to his own involvement in the crime, he also laid at least part of the blame for the murder at the feet of Sean Combs. Davis claimed that soon after the shooting, Combs called Zip to ask, “Was that us?” Davis confirmed that it was and that, despite the personal nature of the killing, he still wanted his million-dollar bounty. He told Zip to handle the money on his behalf, but the payment never came. (Combs has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement in Tupac’s murder and has since called Davis’s claims “nonsense.” He did not respond to repeated requests for comment.) But any real sense of accomplishment was short-lived. Davis’s statements had already enticed Kading’s cop brain toward a new target: Combs. If what Davis was telling them was true, Combs was at the heart of a murder-conspiracy plot that had resulted in Tupac’s death. Just because they couldn’t use Davis’s statements against him in court didn’t mean they couldn’t use them to go after Combs. A few months later, in June 2009, Kading, Dupree, and a DEA agent escorted Davis on a flight to New York City. The plan was for Davis to casually approach Zip Martin and rekindle their drug-trafficking relationship. “If we could catch Zip in the act of buying drugs,” Kading explained. “We could put the squeeze on him.” Perhaps then Zip would be willing to corroborate Davis’s story about the million-dollar bounty that Combs had allegedly put on Tupac and Suge Knight. Over the next few days, Davis made multiple visits to Zip’s Harlem nightclub and, according to Kading, eventually made contact. He offered to cut Zip into a bogus drug deal he was working on, but Zip demurred, telling Davis he was sick and didn’t have the energy for “such a high-risk enterprise.” Zip did offer, however, to put Davis in touch with one of his associates, an introduction that would have tied Zip into a conspiracy charge if things got that far. Kading was pleased, he told me, and immediately began plotting the next phase of the operation. As it turned out, however, there would be no need. Kading’s past was about to come back to haunt him. Earlier that year, a grocery-store owner named Georges Torres, whom Kading had investigated on and off for years before joining the Biggie task force, was found guilty of 55 felony counts, including racketeering, bribery, and solicitation of murder. But rather than validating the efforts of the prosecutors and investigators who put the case together, the conviction quickly turned into a debacle. Within weeks, Torres’s defense attorneys appealed to the judge, claiming that there were fatal flaws in both the prosecution and Kading’s work on the investigation. Namely, that he had misquoted wiretaps and made improper deals for sentencing considerations and cash with at least two witnesses in exchange for their testimony, a similar criticism to the one allegedly levied against him by “Stutterbox” Ross’s lawyer. The judge agreed. In a blistering, 147-page ruling, he wrote that “Detective Kading, had acted, at the least, reckless disregard for the truth” and dismissed the bulk of the charges against Torres. Kading was later exonerated by an LAPD internal-affairs investigation, but the stain left behind by the allegations was difficult to erase. A month after Torres was let out of prison, Kading was called into a meeting with an LAPD commander and told he was being taken off the Biggie task force. “This is being done to protect you,” Kading remembers the commander saying. It was a precipitous fall and one that left Kading embittered. He feared that without him, the task force would “wither and die,” a prediction that turned out to be correct. With Kading gone, his plan for Davis to ensnare Zip and Puffy fizzled out. Higher-ups in the LAPD decided to turn over the evidence Kading had developed to the Las Vegas Metro PD who rushed out to L.A. without understanding the context of the proffer. “They think they’re coming out to potentially arrest Keefe D who has confessed to the murder,” Kading explained. Despite having already been transferred to another division, he was dragged back into the task force offices to explain the situation. “They were a little chagrined,” he said of the Vegas officers. Likewise, the hunt for Biggie’s killer, the task force’s actual assignment, also floundered. Around the same time that Davis was giving his confession, Kading and his colleagues had identified a woman named Tammie Hawkins as a potential conspirator in Biggie’s murder. Hawkins, who was the mother of one of Suge Knight’s children, had been involved in a number of criminal fronts on Knight’s behalf, and Kading believed she might know more than she was letting on. Faced with jail time and the threat of losing custody of her child, Hawkins told the task force that in 1997 Knight had enlisted her to act as a go-between in arranging a hit on Biggie in retaliation for Tupac’s murder. According to Hawkins, the shooter was Wardell “Poochie” Fouse, a Blood gang member who had died in 2003 after being shot ten times in the back while riding his motorcycle in Compton. “He had the mentality to do it,” said Ladd, who had once investigated Poochie for unloading a pistol on the car of a family driving past his house. But without further corroboration, there would always be doubt. Kading was in the middle of requesting a wiretap on Knight when the Torres ruling came down. After he was pulled off the task force, one of his supervisors was asked by a reporter if the LAPD was close to catching the killer in Biggie’s case. “Probably not,” the supervisor replied. Soon after, the task force was officially closed. In 2010, Kading retired. In a different world, the story might have ended there. Davis’s confession was protected by the proffer agreement, and Hawkins’s statements proved to be the death knell for the Wallace lawsuit, which was soon dismissed. With the task force shut down, neither investigation was moving forward. However, on his way out the door, Kading made a decision that would again rile his colleagues. He copied nearly the entire Biggie case file, dozens of boxes containing tens of thousands of documents. Like Russell Poole before him, he had decided to go public. “I couldn’t stand the idea of all our work going to waste,” he told me, though after some prodding he confided that the money he got from his book and media appearances hasn’t hurt either. Kading wasn’t alone in publicizing the case. Since the early 2000s, a cottage industry of podcasts, documentaries, and YouTube shows has developed, each one promising to untangle the conspiracies surrounding the killings of Tupac and Biggie. The hosts and guests, many of whom are paid for their appearances, engage in constant squabbles and name-calling. When I asked Reggie Wright Jr., a frequent guest, whether he found the in-fighting tedious, he laughed. “I find it profitable if you want to keep it real,” he told me. It may explain why Davis began making similar appearances around 2018. Perhaps he saw Kading and others profiting from the story he had told them and wanted a cut. He had also been diagnosed with cancer and may have seen his involvement as a way to shore up his finances. (Davis declined to comment through his lawyer.) Regardless, once he started talking, he held nothing back. In an interview for the BET series Death Row Chronicles, Davis publicly admitted to his involvement in Tupac’s murder for the first time. A year later, he described the killing in detail in his own memoir, Compton Street Legend. Whether or not Davis understood that the terms of the proffer only protected him for the 2009 interview remains unclear. Either way, he continued publicly confessing to the crime right up until the cops arrived at his house last summer. Davis’s arraignment was delayed for weeks while he attempted to find a lawyer, eventually hiring a veteran Nevada defense attorney named Carl Arnold who devised a deceptively simple legal strategy: “He’s a liar,” said Arnold. Davis contends that he lied not only during the proffer agreement to Kading, but also in a follow up interview undertaken by Las Vegas police when they had arrived in L.A. to arrest him. He also lied during his appearances on the Death Row Chronicles TV show and in his own memoir. According to Arnold, prosecutors can’t even definitively place his client in Las Vegas on the night of Tupac’s murder. “Basically their whole case right now, from what I’ve seen, is just Keefe’s statements,” he told reporters. “If that evidence is all it is, we can walk into trial today. We’re walking back out. Not guilty.” Most defense attorneys struggle to demonstrate their client’s reliability; Arnold is hoping to do the opposite. The bigger liar a jury believes Davis to be, the stronger his chance of an acquittal. But if Davis was merely fabricating a tall tale for the ages, then the statements he made to the task force in 2009 would necessarily be untrue, voiding the terms of the proffer agreement. The prosecutors trying the case could then enter it as evidence. When I asked Arnold if he plans to argue that Davis’s once-secret statement made to state and federal authorities a decade ago was also for entertainment purposes only, he laughed. “Keefe told them what they wanted to hear, so he wouldn’t have to go to prison,” he said. Moreover, Arnold welcomed the possibility. It would allow him to exploit what he considered an unexpected asset: Kading. “The idea was brilliant,” Arnold said of the drug case gambit that Kading engineered to ensnare Davis. “But the guy has no credibility whatsoever.” If prosecutors enter the proffer, Arnold would consider calling Kading to the stand. “He’s my Mark Fuhrman,” he said, equating Kading to the racist cop who undermined the case against O.J. Simpson. The legal complications swirling around the case likely won’t be settled until the trial itself gets underway in November, but there’s also another question hounding Las Vegas authorities: Why now? Davis may have been the first person to offer a confession in Shakur’s murder, but similar stories of the killing have been circulating for years. A short time after Las Vegas detectives showed up in Compton wearing cowboy boots, they received an affidavit from Tim Brennan, laying out what he was hearing on the street about who was responsible. With a few minor exceptions, the story repeats almost exactly what Davis would tell authorities decades later. “The streets know before we know,” said Ladd, Brennan’s former partner. Why didn’t Las Vegas cops put more pressure on Davis and Anderson 27 years ago, especially if they had credible information that both were involved? Based on Davis’s statements, the authorities in Las Vegas could also have pursued a case against Terrence Brown, the driver, before his death in a shooting in 2015, but failed to do so. And even after picking the case back up in 2018, they waited five years to indict Davis. It could be that, as Kading believes, prosecutors in Las Vegas were simply “feeding Davis the rope that he used to hang himself with.” The more confessions he offered, the more convincing the case against him would eventually be. In hindsight, it appears that the singular chain of events resulting in Davis’s arrest unfolded in spite of the efforts of law enforcement, not because of them. Russell Poole’s hubris led to the doomed Wallace lawsuit, which led to a task force created to exonerate the LAPD for Biggie’s killing, which led to an unexpected confession in Tupac’s. And even having arrived at such a fortuitous destination, it was Kading’s ego and ethical breaches that brought the task force to an abrupt conclusion before he could pursue Davis’s allegations about Combs’s involvement. Still, the end of the saga appears to be nearing. Arnold thinks the November trial date will stick. “They’re stuck with murder,” he told me. “They couldn’t give us any offer that we would accept.” Kading isn’t so sure. He thinks Davis will strike a deal with prosecutors before the trial. “They’ll give him a sweet offer just to put this thing to rest,” he said. “The whole thing will be anticlimactic.” I wondered whether Kading, after dedicating years of his life to unraveling the killings of Tupac and Biggie, would find such a resolution deflating, but he didn’t think so. He believed that despite all the controversy and convolutions, his efforts had revealed a decidedly uncomplicated truth: Tupac’s murder was an act of gang retaliation; Biggie’s, an act of revenge. “It’s the strangest paradox,” he told me. “Tupac Shakur’s case, and really Biggie’s too, at the very base of it, they’re just so simple.”"
30,Nia Prater,"Without Congestion Pricing, Will the Subway Go Broke?",http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/without-congestion-pricing-will-the-subway-go-broke.html,"State Senator Liz Krueger on what’s next after Governor Kathy Hochul’s decision to pause the program and, with it, billions of dollars in revenue for the MTA.",2024-06-12T10:00:11Z,"When Governor Kathy Hochul effectively killed congestion pricing last week, she also blew a hole in the budget of the MTA, leaving the State Legislature to scramble in the last hours of its session last week to find a new source of revenue for the transit agency. The congestion-pricing program, which was slated to go into effect on June 30, was expected to bring in $1 billion annually for the MTA and back $15 billion worth of capital projects such as the extension of the Second Avenue Subway. Among Hochul’s ideas to replace the revenue were a payroll tax on city businesses and a thinly detailed IOU proposal, neither of which were popular among lawmakers. The session ended without finding a new source of funding for the MTA. Liz Krueger, the Democratic chair of the finance committee who represents Manhattan in the State Senate, denounced Hochul’s move as “reckless” and said Hochul disrupted years of careful planning and negotiations on a “political whim.” We spoke Tuesday about where things now stand with the governor, the legislature, and the future of mass transit in the city. Governor Hochul caught everyone off guard last week with her pause of the congestion-pricing program, forcing you and your colleagues to quickly consider a few possible proposals to potentially fund the MTA including a tax on city businesses and what essentially amounted to an IOU. What were those discussions like? What was the mood like in Albany? Last week was our last week of session, so the mood already was on hyperdrive because we were trying to pass, frankly, hundreds of bills between the two houses. So, it wasn’t exactly the best time for any surprises to come out of the woodwork from the governor. Not that there isn’t often some kind of end-of-session surprise, but this one was, you know, to be quite blunt, totally shocking. You could have pushed us all over with a leaf when we’re learning this. I’d been hearing rumors for a couple of days from reporters, saying, “Have you heard about a delay of congestion pricing?” And I was like, “No.” And then, I even reached out to the MTA and they said, “No, we don’t know what you’re talking about.” I was like, “Good, just a rumor, no problem.” And then boom. So it was like, I don’t know, a bad movie script. What impact did the governor’s decision have on the Legislature’s ability to do its job last week? Well frankly, it’s very disturbing because I think a number of really important bills didn’t get through at the end of session because everybody got thrown off and shifted into this issue, including, by the way, the governor’s people, who were in three-way negotiations on a bunch of these bills and then suddenly weren’t available for anything cause it was all congestion pricing. I have a bill called the NY Heat Act. We literally were in three-way negotiations for several weeks and we were so close. And then the governor’s people weren’t responding to calls or requests for that very last meeting. I didn’t want to pass a bill that would be vetoed. I really wanted a bill that actually did what I needed to do and wouldn’t be vetoed. So, then they stopped reaching out and NY Heat did not pass because we never got to the three-way agreement that we were sure we would. I think if you ask some other members, they would tell you the same thing on other crucial bills that they’ve been working on, in some cases for years. It really threw things off. The Legislature ended its session without designating a new source of funding for the MTA. Where do things stand right now? Is it likely that lawmakers will return for a special session to figure this out? I have no idea. We won’t return unless there’s an answer. That was what was appalling about the governor’s proposal. It wasn’t a proposal to replace the money or to replace the incredibly negative impact on congestion and the environment, particularly in Manhattan. She just decided to pause seemingly without talking to any experts, since I feel like I’ve talked to everyone in transportation, the environment, business, and none of them were consulted. And, as far as I can tell, everyone, if they were consulted, would have said, “Don’t be ridiculous, don’t do this.” And what you learn quickly was of her two proposals, the first one was just a new tax on the quote-unquote businesses — but really the workers only in New York City because the payroll tax is actually a tax on employees. (It was the tax we used last year and increased just on the operating costs of the MTA.) And we’re going to walk away from a model where New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, tourists, the 12 counties would all share the cost because they’re all using the mass-transit system and the streets of New York City. So, we go from a less regressive, more distributive model for paying for the MTA capital plan to a regressive, only-on–New York City–workers plan. Again, why would we do that? So, then they came up with this sort of odd, three-sentence IOU. In fact, the bond markets, they’re gonna lower the MTA bond rating because of this debacle. Meaning when we borrow money for the MTA — which, by the way, we do every day of the week for different projects — we’re gonna have to pay more. So, no one could actually prove to us how that was gonna work and why anyone would actually lend the MTA $15 billion on an IOU. So, we also were like, that’s not a legitimate model. We also had no idea whether any of this was legal because, speaking for myself, I didn’t think canceling this on a whim was legal. There’s public-authority law, there’s fiduciary responsibilities of the board-member law, there’s environmental law. There were agreements with the federal government, settlements on previous lawsuits. Just endless legal questions that no one in the governor’s shop was prepared to even pretend to answer. At a press conference, Hochul seemed to suggest that the funds to fund the MTA’s capital projects do exist elsewhere and that those that think congestion pricing is the only possible source show “a lack of imagination.” Yeah, I heard that too. Maybe I do lack imagination. I’m pretty boring. I’m just a legislator. I read bills. I talk to lawyers. I try to review statutes. So, maybe she’s right. I lack imagination. And did she offer what her imagination offered us as real? I don’t think she offered any specifics, no.See, that’s the problem with all this, right? Of course, the government can always tax. Of course, the government can borrow. It’s how much and at what cost. I think what really gets lost in this storyline, this $15 billion was for projects we’ve already started and committed to and are even in the middle of from a capital plan that is four out of five years in, right? We’re going to do a new capital plan for the next five years. I haven’t seen a final document yet, but I’m going to project that’s already another $50 billion we’re going to have to figure out how to pay for through a combination of state funds, taxes, bonds, etc. She keeps saying this was unpopular. Yes, taxes are unpopular by definition. And yet, in the absence of revenue for government, I believe you collapse into chaos and you certainly don’t have a state that people actually want to live in or can successfully live in. So yeah, I get it was unpopular. Research around previous cities that moved to congestion pricing was that it’s at its highest level of unpopularity right before it started and then quickly gets absorbed into the Zeitgeist of “Oh, yeah, now we do this. Oh, look, there’s a lot less traffic. Hurray.” I’m not challenging that public-opinion polls showed it was unpopular. I just don’t think government has the privilege of not doing things that are unpopular. I think that we are responsible and obligated to do the best we can on behalf of the people of the State of New York even when that means taking unpopular action. There’s been speculation that Hochul’s motivations could be political, an attempt to take a divisive issue off the board before the 2024 election out of concerns that it could hurt Democrats on the ballot. If true, what do you make of that argument? Well, the Republicans are having a ball with this. I think they’re playing it to their advantage incredibly well. So, I do not think it’s particularly helpful to Democrats running in November. I’m old enough to remember the 1999 commuter-tax debacle where the same exact argument was made that it would be popular for elections in Long Island and the Hudson Valley if we did away with the commuter tax. And again, it was Democrats then that also just came up with this great idea to end the commuter tax and that was going to help us win elections in those specific two areas, the same areas they’re talking about now. And we lost all the seats we were hoping to win and we never got the commuter tax back. I just feel like I’m living through some strange déjà vu of an absolutely wrong political analysis that is not going to accomplish any of its, not stated, but hypothetical reasons for being the right thing to do. No one’s saying she canceled congestion pricing specifically to help candidates. I mean, that’s implied, but I don’t think she’s ever said that. But I just see the Republicans already doing TV commercials. “I’m Mike Lawler, and I got you out of congestion pricing.” I think it’s a bad economic decision and it’s a bad political decision and it’s a bad environmental decision.

31,Sarah Jones,"Fetterman, Torres, Jones Chose to Leave Progressives",http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/fetterman-torres-jones-progressives.html,Sarah Jones writes that politicians who still side with Israel in its bloody war on Gaza have made a choice to leave the progressive movement.,2024-06-14T11:00:16Z,"“I didn’t leave the progressive movement; the progressive movement left me,” Representative Ritchie Torres of the Bronx recently told City & State New York. He was referring to the conflict within the left over Israel. Describing himself as a Zionist for the past decade, about “half of his posts, retweets or interactions” since October 7 have been supportive of Israel, City & State reported. Torres is not a hypocrite. If we take him at his word, he’s been a Zionist for a long time. But he’s not being entirely truthful about the progressive movement or his place within it either. The movement didn’t leave him: He left it, if indeed he was ever fully part of it, by making a series of deliberate choices. One such choice is to support Israel despite the unbelievable brutality it has inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza. Support for Israel isn’t the only reason Torres might find himself outside the progressive movement. During his time on the City Council, Torres angered progressive supporters by agreeing “to water down the Right to Know Act, which would have forced officers to provide a business card in every encounter with the public,” City & State reported. In 2017, ahead of the vote, he said, “I stand by what I have chosen to do, even if it means standing alone … even if it means I am no longer beloved in progressive circles.” He carried that attitude with him to Congress, where he discovered allies within the Democratic Party, such as Senator John Fetterman. The Pennsylvania senator also holds a stringent pro-Israel position and told comedian Bill Maher this month that progressivism “left” him after October 7. “I didn’t leave the label, it left me on that,” he said. Mondaire Jones, who’s running to return to Congress, struck a similar note in an interview with Politico. After he endorsed the AIPAC-backed George Latimer over progressive incumbent Jamaal Bowman, he came under significant fire from the left. The political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus even rescinded its endorsement of him. “These people were never my actual friends,” he claimed, saying that he would do nothing differently if given the chance. “The appreciation that people have in these actual communities in the Hudson Valley is what matters to me,” he said. “That as well as my own sense of morality compelled me to intervene, given how god-awful Mr. Bowman’s conduct has been.” Torres, Fetterman, and Jones are free to say that the progressive movement has left them behind. Perhaps they think they’re even being honest. The term “progressive” can be vague, even meaningless. Various Democrats and their supporters interpret it in wildly divergent ways. It’s possible, then, for Torres to think of himself as a progressive, though he was never as far left as some may have hoped. But that exercise is difficult to sustain now, as Israel carries out a genocidal campaign in Gaza. Torres and pro-Israel politicians like him have sided with power over the powerless. In doing so, they’ve cast themselves out of the progressive movement. The label didn’t leave Fetterman; he merely discarded it. He was happy to call himself progressive in social-media posts, to court the left as a candidate, and to accept a Sanders endorsement during his successful run for lieutenant governor. Now, when it truly counts, Fetterman is likelier to taunt the left than he is to embrace it. The left must employ litmus tests if terms like progressive are going to mean anything at all, and Fetterman would fail. So too would Torres and Jones. If they feel uncomfortable with the progressive movement now, it’s likely a sign they never belonged in the first place. Their values were always in conflict with the left, and Gaza merely brought that reality into sharper focus. It’s convenient, though, for pro-Israel Democrats to shift blame onto the left. Doing so gives them a chance to present themselves as brave truth tellers: See Jones, speaking of his personal sense of morality. But the left is not as powerful as I want it to be, and no courage is necessary to attack it. Critics instead exaggerate its influence in order to score points. It’s a cheap way to look principled. Jones must invent straw men — “​​trust fund socialists in Williamsburg,” as he put it to Politico — in order to sound somewhat reasonable, let alone courageous. Courage is not in the eye of the beholder. It means something. (So should the word progressive.) There’s nothing brave about rejecting the left in a moment of great moral consequence. Nor is there anything particularly courageous about standing with Israel, a longtime U.S. ally, as it pummels Gaza into dust. Courage in politics looks more like Bowman, who faces a formidable challenge from AIPAC as he defends his seat in Congress. A recent poll showed Bowman trailing Latimer, who is running to his right, but Bowman has refused to compromise his beliefs. “They’ve got money, we’ve got people,” he posted on X. The U.S. needs a viable left: a counterweight to politicians who turn their backs to ongoing mass murder. Without it, we’re doomed not to ambivalence but something worse, an embrace of brutality and vengeance and horror. Torres, Fetterman, and Jones have made their choices. Progressive may be a mostly toothless label, but if it’s still too much, the movement is better off without them in it.

32,Nia Prater,Why Does Nathan Wade Keep Giving Interviews?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/why-does-nathan-wade-keep-giving-interviews.html,"In a CNN sit-down, the Georgia lawyer, who had been prosecuting Trump, seemed unprepared to answer questions about his relationship with Fani Willis.",2024-06-13T16:39:05Z,"Nathan Wade might need to rethink his media strategy. The former Fulton County special prosecutor has been hitting the airwaves ever since he resigned from the team in charge of the Georgia election-interference case against Donald Trump, fielding interviews from MSNBC and even The View. But Wade’s recent sit-down with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins quickly grew awkward as Wade paused their talk midway to confer with a member of his team after Collins asked him about his past relationship with Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. My exchange with Nathan Wade tonight on the timeline of his romantic relationship with District Attorney Fani Willis — including an interruption from a member of his team as he was answering when it began and when it ended. pic.twitter.com/S5AJzdsmOC Earlier this year, it emerged that Willis and Wade, who worked on her team, had been in a romantic relationship. An attorney representing one of the defendants in the racketeering case filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing a conflict of interest between the two. Willis and Wade were grilled during a hearing on the matter, forced to answer deeply personal questions about the length of their relationship and whether the district attorney financially benefited from taking on the case. In the end, the judge ruled that Willis could continue on in the trial if Wade stepped down. He soon submitted his resignation. During the CNN interview, Collins asked Wade about the current state of his relationship with Willis. “We are great friends,” he said. “We speak regularly. The conversation has changed, though, whereas before our conversations were about this case.” Collins then asked Wade about when his relationship with Willis first started. “There’s been this effort to say that these exact dates are at issue,” Wade began, looking at someone off-camera. “I’m being signaled here,” he said. A man whom CNN identified as Wade’s media consultant came to his side and asked if they could briefly go off mic. Cameras continued to roll as Wade received help with removing his mic. He rose from his seat and huddled with his consultant with their backs turned. After speaking for a moment, Wade then sat down and the interview continued. “Everything okay?” Collins asked. “Yeah,” Wade said. Collins then asked the question again, and Wade demurred this time, saying the public already has a clear timeline of his and Willis’s relationship from testimony and other interviews. “It is not a relevant issue in this case, and I think that we should be focusing on more of the facts and the indictment in the case,” he said. Wade indicated that he didn’t want to comment further, citing the fact that the Georgia Court of Appeals is set to decide on the matter of Willis’s disqualification. “I do think the timing of the personal relationship I had was bad,” Nathan Wade tells me in our interview. “The only thing I regret is the timing of it.” pic.twitter.com/cN89CWJW8g Wade said that while he regrets the “timing” of the relationship, he doesn’t believe his actions played a role in the delay of the Trump cases, which has been put on hold by a Georgia appeals court.

Kennedy Jr. refiled a ballot petition in Nevada after spelling ‘United States’ wrong.,2024-06-13T21:20:06Z,"The Robert F. Kennedy Jr. campaign is facing an uphill battle to get on the ballot in many states this November. In their quest to offer voters a third option, campaign officials can’t afford to make mistakes of any kind, let alone obvious ones. And yet. On Thursday, the Nevada Independent reported that RFK’s campaign refiled its ballot petition in the Silver State because the original had including a misspelling of the words United States. RFK and his VP choice, Nicole Shanahan, the petition said, were running for the office of “President of the United States and Vice President of the Unites States.” (Can you spot the error?) Though it was unclear if the misspelling would have rendered the entire petition null and void, RFK Jr.’s campaign refiled its paperwork with Nevada’s secretary of state. Unfortunately, the follow-up petition also included a typo. “We do not want ballot access to be rejected because of an typo,” campaign attorney Paul Rossi wrote. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, there are many more problems than typos at RFK headquarters, where staffers are afraid of microwave radiation and one digital strategist who graduated high school during the Biden administration is making $8,000 a month.

34,Ed Kilgore,Southern Baptists’ Attack on IVF Will Likely Backfire,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/southern-baptists-ivf-backfire.html,"A Southern Baptist Convention resolution opposing IVF treatments is far out of line with lay opinion, and even with Republicans. It may hurt Baptists more than it hurts IVF.",2024-06-13T18:10:16Z,"In the latest stage of a multi-decade radical conservative makeover of the once fiercely independent religious denomination, the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in Indianapolis adopted a resolution condemning the creation and destruction of embryos generally involved in IVF treatments. While it didn’t demand a strict ban on IVF, the resolution called on the denomination’s 13 million members to “advocate for the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings,” while also encouraging infertile couples to find other ways to have children. Thus, the nation’s largest Evangelical Protestant community placed itself firmly to the right of the conservative Republicans who have been stampeding to proclaim their love for IVF in the wake of an Alabama Supreme Court decision that ruled IVF clinics might be subject to wrongful-death liability for discarding embryonic “children” under the state’s radical anti-abortion laws. Indeed, the GOP legislature and governor of Alabama (right there in the Southern Baptist heartland) raced to enact a law to allow IVF clinics to continue treatments despite the grim court ruling. In addition, the very favorite politician of conservative Evangelicals, Donald Trump, said he would “strongly support the availability of IVF” as president. So will the SBC resolution make a difference out there in the real world where laws are made and treatments are secured (generally at great cost and difficulty to the patients)? Politico’s Megan Messerly thinks so: The move may signal the beginning of a broad turn on the right against IVF, an issue that many evangelicals, anti-abortion advocates and other social conservatives see as the “pro-life” movement’s next frontier — one they hope will eventually lead to restrictions, or outright bans, on IVF at the state and federal levels. I don’t know about that. It’s not like the SBC delegates are pushing on an open door in attacking IVF as semi-homicidal. A Pew survey last month on IVF showed widespread support for IVF across all sorts of partisan, ideological, and religious lines. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents called access to IVF “a good thing” rather than “a bad thing” by a margin of 63 percent to 10 percent; Democrats and Democratic-leaning indies agreed by a margin of 79 percent to 5 percent. People who say they oppose allowing abortions “in most cases” backed IVF 60 percent to 11 percent; even those opposing abortion “in all cases” smiled on IVF by a two-to-one margin (40 percent to 20 percent). Most relevantly, white Evangelical Protestants, of which Southern Baptists are the largest single bloc, favored availability of IVF by a margin of 63 percent to 9 percent. That isn’t much of a base for a counterrevolution on this subject. Perhaps it would be useful to look at the influence on this subject of another large religious denomination that has taken a hard line against IVF. The Roman Catholic Church, as noted by the National Catholic Register, has been clear about it: “The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that IVF is ‘morally unacceptable’ because it separates the marriage act from procreation and establishes ‘the domination of technology’ over human life.” Now it’s well known that the Vatican’s opposition to “artificial” birth control based on the idea that it “separates the marriage act from procreation” is widely disregarded by the folks in the pews. But the recent Pew data suggest the church’s long-standing opposition to IVF isn’t cutting much ice either: Self-identified Catholics says IVF is “a good thing” rather than “a bad thing” by a margin of 65 percent to 8 percent. According to Messerly, SBC opponents of IVF are playing the long game: “It’s going to be a long process. It took us 50 years to take down Roe,” said Brent Leatherwood, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the public policy arm of the SBC. “It may take us a similarly long time frame to get people to a place where they are thinking more deeply about something like this. It’s okay. It takes time. We have to be patient.” That’s one way of looking at the tides of history. Another is that the SBC itself has been engaged in a half-century devolution on reproductive rights since its 1971 resolution that “call[ed] upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” At some point, the gap between the denomination’s official pronouncements on IVF and lay opinion could create a backlash rather than a confirmation of views that contradict the widespread belief that IVF is about as “pro-family” a practice as can be imagined.

35,James D. Walsh,Sixteen Kids and a Hit Man,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/christopher-pence-corderos-fbi-dark-web-hit-man.html,Why did a father of 16 hire a dark-web hit man? Christopher Pence kept adding to his family. Then he decided to remove two people from the mix.,2024-06-14T09:00:49Z,"This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. One weekday in the summer of 2021, Christopher Pence entered his home office in Cedar City, Utah, and plugged a USB stick into his computer. He booted up Tails, an operating system designed to optimize privacy, and used it to access the dark web — a marketplace teeming with illicit goods and services like child pornography, weapons, and drugs. Christopher, who was 41 and worked for Microsoft as a systems engineer, wanted to hire a hit man to kill a young couple he had met on only a handful of occasions. Christopher was an unlikely client in the murder-for-hire trade. He was not violent and had no criminal record. When he wasn’t logging ten-to-12-hour days working, often while listening to one of his favorite Christian rock bands, he was helping his wife, Michelle, raise their 11 biological and five adopted children. The entire family, along with Christopher’s retired parents, lived in a 5,800-square-foot home on the northern edge of the Mojave Desert, surrounded by wind-raked brushland and snow-capped mountains in all directions. They were building greenhouses on the property and had plans to buy cows. The Pences were committed Evangelical Christians, and on Sundays they would pile into their 15-passenger Ford Transit and drive north to worship at Valley Bible Church. Afterward, they’d invite church members to their home for fellowship. “If you met them and saw the way that their house was run, it was a joyous, happy atmosphere,” says Tom Jeffcott, the senior pastor of the congregation. “There was a lot of love. It was a structured home, a model of learning, of support, of understanding.” The eldest Pence daughters sometimes harmonized while they washed the dishes. The Pences had arrived in Cedar City in 2020, and before long Christopher and Michelle confided something troubling to their new pastor. They said they were being hounded by Christina and Francisco Cordero, the biological parents of their five adopted children. The two couples had worked out an agreement that allowed the Corderos some contact with their kids — emails, one phone call a month, two in-person visits a year. But recently, in Christopher’s view, the Corderos had been pushing it. They’d even moved across the country to live closer to the children they’d given up. Jeffcott saw the toll the pressure was taking on his new congregants. To help them find a legal remedy, he introduced them to an attorney. At the same time, Christopher was looking into an extrajudicial approach. He learned about Tails while reading about Edward Snowden, who used the operating system to hide his activities from the National Security Agency. In July 2021, with the software running, Christopher called up Ahmia, a darknet search engine, and looked for a website offering to connect customers with assassins. He settled on a site called the Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace. Christopher created an extravagantly cryptic username, mjd210eKd69BxG4IsJD, and began messaging other users. “Good day Admin! I have a couple targets—husband wife—that I am needing removed,” he wrote. “However, it is known that they and I don’t quite see eye-to-eye on something. I am a couple days away from submitting the job as an ‘accident,’ but before I do, I was wondering, in your experience, even if it is an obvious ‘accident,’ what kind of investigation will be run against me, knowing that we are not on the best of terms?” Two weeks later, Christopher transferred $16,000 worth of bitcoin and submitted orders to kill the Corderos. Christopher and Michelle Pence hadn’t planned on having an enormous family. They met as teenagers in a community just north of Seattle and married in 1999, when Christopher was 19 and Michelle was 20. The next year, Michelle gave birth to twin girls. Christopher’s dream was to make a fortune in finance and real estate and live in a penthouse in downtown Seattle. He imagined Michelle would have her own high-powered career. After she became pregnant with their fourth child, he had a vasectomy. Christopher had been raised religious, and in his mid-20s he began to lean more on his faith for guidance on life’s biggest questions. He thought less about his career and more about his higher calling. “God changed my thinking about how a man is to be the leader of his family and how children are actually blessings and rewards,” he said in a speech at his church. “There are many biblical examples about how our dreams may not be what God wants for us. Job did not want his children to die or his storehouses to be destroyed or his health to be impaired, but God’s perfect will allowed this to happen. Jeremiah wanted to marry a nice girl and have a family, but instead God used him as a prophet of death.” Exactly one year after his vasectomy, Christopher had it reversed. Michelle documented the family’s life on a blog, and she described how her sense of self, and her role in her marriage, changed as she read books like Created to Be His Help Meet and The Power of Motherhood: What the Bible Says About Mothers. “I entered marriage thinking of it as an equal partnership, knowing but not understanding what it meant that my husband is my head,” Michelle wrote. “I had NO idea the importance of my role as a mother, and the significance God placed on motherhood. I had no idea that God called barrenness a CURSE, and children the greatest blessing he can bestow. I had no idea that God said so much about children in the Bible, they are heritage, a REWARD, a blessing, precious little lambs, arrows in the hands of a mighty warrior and so much more.” The Pences came to “trust God to open and close the womb as He sees fit.” By 2017, Michelle had given birth to ten children. One died at five months from sudden infant death syndrome; there were also several miscarriages. Another child was born with cerebral palsy. Needing space, the family had gone to live with Christopher’s parents in a semi-rural town 25 miles northeast of Seattle. They turned their property into a homestead with gardens, beehives, dogs, chickens, turkeys, a lilac-crowned parrot, and a succession of cows named Steak, Dinner, Beef, Burrito, and Norman. The kids slept in bunk beds, and everyone traveled to appointments and church in a short bus. Michelle chafed when doctors advised her to stop having kids; when a social worker questioned her ability to effectively homeschool a child with a disability; when someone at the grocery store casually remarked on the size of her family. She was passionate about educating her children herself and valued, above all, the freedom to teach a curriculum focused on the Bible. The Pences considered the text a straightforward account of history, and every morning, before sunrise, Christopher led the family in studying Scripture. To Michelle, Christopher was “the handsome man who makes it all happen around here” and “a fantastic example of loving me as Christ loved the church, even when I am very much unlovable.” He was the breadwinner and had a succession of technology-related jobs, including managing a computer store and working as a network architect, before landing a job at Microsoft. Michelle described him with devotion as “a great priest, prophet, provider and protector for his family” who “truly lives out what it means to be a follower of Christ, to deny himself and live for his God, and his family.” Even as they continued to have children, the Pences wanted to accelerate the growth of their family through adoption. They were motivated in part by religion, believing that the process was a form of “making the same commitment to a child (or children), that God made to us … to take us in our filth, our sin, our depravity, and bring us to a place of being a beloved child.” But the choice was also deeply personal. Michelle came from a troubled home. She had met her father only three times. She was one of six half-siblings, all from different fathers, who were split up by the foster-care system. “I know all too well what loss, abandonment, neglect, and abuse do to a child … because I was that child,” Michelle wrote around the time she and Christopher began submitting applications. They hoped to adopt an entire “young sibling group, who are having trouble staying together because of size,” she wrote on one listings website, adding that they would not mind remaining in contact with the children’s biological parents. The Pences worked with traditional agencies, submitting to hours of training, interviews with social workers, psychological reviews, and home studies. Opportunities in Colombia and Florida didn’t pan out. One organization blocked them from adopting a group of five siblings because the Pences already had children of similar ages — not optimal, in the agency’s view. After a few years of dashed hopes, Michelle gave birth again in 2018. That September, taking advantage of Microsoft’s six-week paternity-leave policy, the Pences packed into a motor home and headed east. They saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, worked a miniature Model T production line at the Henry Ford Museum, and stood on a beach in Acadia National Park while the Atlantic rushed over their feet. At some point along the journey, Michelle logged on to a message board for parents with large, homeschooled families. A mother of six in Massachusetts had posted that she and her husband were looking for someone to take care of their children temporarily while they worked through some marital issues. Michelle sent her a message. The woman, Christina Cordero, and her husband, Francisco, were struggling. They’d had a single-story, four-bedroom house in Chicopee, in Western Massachusetts, but had recently sold it and moved into an RV. Their oldest child was developmentally disabled, and finding adequate housing “proved impossible with such a large family,” Christina told me in a Facebook message. Cisco, as her husband was known, could only find work as a temp. “I was offering six months rent up front, but no landlord would consider us.” Cisco had personal problems that compounded their troubles. He admitted to the authorities at one point that his sexual behavior was a continuous challenge for his family. He had fought an addiction to pornography since he was a teenager, and the Massachusetts Department of Children & Families (DCF) had investigated him for looking at child porn and showing sexual images to his children. He denied the allegations, and the state took no action. The Pences arranged to visit the Corderos at their RV in Massachusetts and pray with them. Christopher Pence later said that when they arrived, Christina confided that she didn’t think her children were safe with Cisco. (Christina disputes this.) The Pences said they were open to taking them but suggested that Christina mull it over while they continued on their road trip. When the Pences traveled back through Massachusetts a few days later, the Corderos said they wanted to go through with the arrangement. The two families agreed on a plan for the next few months: The Corderos would keep their child with special needs while the other five went to live with the Pences. The Corderos signed a caregiver-authorization affidavit, a notarized contract that granted the Pences the right to make medical and educational decisions for the children. And then the Pences, their children, and the five Cordero children all crammed into the motor home and left. Christopher Pence later said, “We got to Massachusetts with ten children and left there with 15.” Almost immediately, it became clear that integrating the five Corderos, ages 1 to 9, with the Pence kids, who spanned from less than a year old to 17, was going to be awkward. In Mount Vernon, where they stopped to visit George Washington’s estate, an employee asked if they were all one big family. One of the Pence girls answered “yes.” Then a Cordero child interjected: “No, there’s ten of them and five of us, and they took us from our parents in Massachusetts.” On the way back across the country, the Pences stopped at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, where the exhibits show humans coexisting with dinosaurs. They also dropped by Ark Encounter, where the entire group posed for a portrait in front of the doors to a model of Noah’s Ark. In the photo, Christopher and Michelle, who were still in their 30s, could just as easily have been the eldest cousins bookending an extended family photo instead of the parents and guardians of the 15 children huddled between them. Most of the kids seem upbeat despite the long hours on the highway. One of the eldest Pence daughters has her youngest sibling strapped to her chest. On Christopher’s back, in a baby carrier, is the youngest Cordero child, his face fixed in an observant gaze. The ad hoc nature of the arrangement drew the attention of the child-welfare system. According to police records, soon after the Pences returned to Washington, a deputy with the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office performed a welfare check at the request of the Massachusetts DCF. “All were healthy and appeared happy … home is large and very clean … Michelle is researching how to obtain financial aid for kids as she has been paying out of pocket for their care,” the deputy wrote in his report. Michelle was feeling stressed, though, and she used her blog to vent about her new reality. “Keeping everyone busy has been an essential around here because the Corderos miss their parents like crazy!” she wrote. She seemed frustrated to realize how different the Cordero children were from her own and overwhelmed by the behavioral problems that followed the siblings’ abrupt separation from their parents. Michelle wrote about the newfound “disharmony” in her house and “epic proportions melt downs”: “Never have we had anyone struggling with sharing, and now it is a huge problem. Never have we had anyone seeking to undermine anyone else or using the level of sharp words and unkind attitudes that we see here now. Never have we seen anyone give an eye roll before this experience … Not to mention the screeching, yelling and whining that accompanies the above.” Ten days before Thanksgiving, Michelle announced that each night, the children would have to say one thing they were thankful for before they could eat dinner. “We had tears and one saying that she wouldn’t be able to eat until after Thanksgiving because there was nothing to be thankful for,” Michelle wrote. “I am thankful that my bio children are able to help show others how richly blessed we are even when life isn’t going how we want it to.” As Christmas approached, Michelle and Christopher gathered the children to play a game that would teach them about labor and wages. They explained that sometimes, wages are good. (The wages for making beds that day was lava cake.) Other times, wages are levied for wrongdoing. (The Bible says the wages of sin is death.) They asked the children to talk about the sins they had recently committed; they then announced that the wages would be either $10,000 per child or the loss of their Christmas presents. Some of the children “thought we were joking,” Michelle wrote on her blog. “But we finally got it across that we were not. Anyone who couldn’t pay the penalty would have no Christmas.” Then Christopher stood up and said he would pay for the children. Michelle wrote: “Because of his great, willing sacrifice, everyone else will get presents, but Christopher will not. We made the comparison that Jesus took our sins upon himself and paid the penalty for us.” At some point, the Corderos and Pences agreed to extend their temporary custody arrangement. The Pences decided that their home, at just 1,900 square feet, was not large enough. Christopher took to Zillow. Microsoft allowed him to work from anywhere, and he found a 4,150-square-foot house on eight heavily wooded acres in Hawkins, Texas, for $325,000. They moved in June 2019. During this period, according to legal filings, the Corderos were under investigation by the Massachusetts DCF. It is unclear what the agency was looking into, but the Snohomish sheriff’s office attempted at least two additional welfare checks on the children at DCF’s request. The agency eventually told both families that it intended to take custody of the Cordero children and bring them back to Massachusetts, where they might be split up in foster care. (A spokesperson declined to comment.) To keep the siblings together, the Corderos and Pences agreed to make the adoption permanent. In December 2019, the Pences traveled back to Washington to go before a judge and make it official. A picture from that day shows the Pences with all 15 children smiling broadly as they crowd together behind the judge’s bench. The Corderos had made three cross-country trips to visit their children — twice in Washington, once in Texas — and knew they could not afford to keep doing so. They decided to move to Texas as well. “It was the logical step,” Christina told me. But it unsettled Christopher and Michelle, who started to feel that the Corderos were using them to hide their children from the Massachusetts child-welfare system. Christopher later claimed that the Corderos asked if they could permanently park their trailer home on the Pences’ property. (Christina told me she had asked to park there only during sanctioned visits.) Eventually, the Corderos rented a space at Good Luck RV in Dallas, a two-hour drive from the Pences’ home in Hawkins. The Pences had a series of difficult conversations with their newly adopted children. One was especially excited that Christina and Cisco had moved to the same state because he thought he would see them more often. “That was a little challenging to work through — that no, even though your birth parents are in Texas, they can’t come over any time they like to, because we need to maintain structure and order to family life,” Christopher said. The Cordero children were also wounded by the fact that their parents were continuing to have more kids. A few months into the arrangement with the Pences, Christina gave birth to a seventh child, and in Texas they told the children they were expecting an eighth. “The oldest girl, she’s kind of hurt that they would have more children after giving up five,” Christopher later said. Everything was in flux. After little more than a year in Texas, the Pences were ready to leave. The eastern part of the state felt like something out of Exodus with extreme weather and scorpions in the bathtub. “Everything down there is trying to kill ya,” Christopher said. “Bugs, snakes, spiders. We got to the point where the children couldn’t really play outside much.” He went back to Zillow and found a seven-bedroom house in Cedar City, Utah, and purchased it for $659,000 in November 2020. Soon after they moved in, Christopher’s sister visited and took pictures of the entire family playing in the snow, including a newly born 11th biological child. The Pences never shared their new address with the Corderos. When the five adopted children sent mail to their birth parents, the Pences wrote in a post-office box for a return address. It is not entirely clear why Christopher Pence wanted the Corderos dead. In Utah, he quickly convinced the family’s new pastor, Jeffcott, that both Christina and Cisco loomed over their household like specters. “They really were creating problems for the children,” Jeffcott told me. “I mean, wetting the bed — just really bad consequences from exposure to the birth parents.” But the Pences’ concern was vague. It also did not seem to involve fears of sexual abuse. Christopher considered Cisco a Lothario but did not think his behavior in that regard involved the children. A turning point apparently came in May 2021. The Pences returned to Texas to meet with the Corderos. After that meeting, according to Christopher, one of the Cordero children claimed to have seen bruises on the arm of her eldest sibling, the one with developmental problems; when asked where the bruises had come from, he claimed Cisco held him down. (Christina disputes this.) Two months later, Christopher logged on to the Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace. He spent weeks lingering on the site, looking closely at its FAQ, which offered half-baked answers to questions like “Could this be a honeypot operated by law enforcement?” and “Do you murder children?” (The answer to the latter: “Yes.”) At one point, Pence created a new thread to ask other users if the site was real or a scam. Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace listed rates that ranged from $5,000 to $200,000, and Christopher wrote the administrators to get clarity. Seeing as his targets lived at the same address, could he receive a discount? Christopher also wanted to be sure the hit man knew the Corderos lived with three children: “I am really trying to avoid them from being hurt. I’m wondering if a mugging-gone-wrong might be an option. Or maybe you have another suggestion? One of the children is 13 or so, but slow, so maybe his testimony could help avoid scrutiny/investigation.” Two site administrators provided short responses. In late July 2021, Christopher began transferring bitcoin into an escrow account and, eventually, ordered the hit. He entered Christina and Cisco’s address and attached photos of the couple he had taken from their biological daughter’s baby book. Hours later, Christopher messaged the administrators that he wanted the murder order canceled. The next day, he resubmitted it, repeating his request to “please make it look like an accident, or a mugging-gone-wrong, or something of the sort.” In the days to come, he sent a flurry of messages asking for some confirmation that the Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace had received them. He never heard back. Six thousand miles away from Cedar City, somewhere in Romania, a small band of internet scammers got a payday. Since at least 2016, the group had run a stable of sites on the dark web, including Sicilian Hitmen and Yakuza Mafia, offering bogus murder-for-hire services. They took money from users who wanted people killed, but they never acted on the jobs. The mastermind behind the operation was a fraudster who went by the name Yura. In 2022, at the urging of the United States, Romanian authorities reportedly arrested Yura and his crew, but it’s unclear if they were ever prosecuted. Yura claimed to Wired that he is an FBI informant. Whether or not that’s true, law-enforcement agencies have gotten a detailed view into his operation and its thousands of clients thanks to the efforts of Chris Monteiro, a British hacker. In 2016, Monteiro discovered a vulnerability in one of Yura’s websites that allowed him to scrape its data, including direct messages and payments. Since then, he has used similar techniques to repeatedly intercept the network’s traffic and feed it to governments and journalists. “There’s a lot to say about what I’m doing. Is justice being done? Is it good? Probably. But also, could it be done better? I think so,” Monteiro told me over Zoom, sitting at his workstation in the living room of his South London flat. He is in his early 40s, and his long hair was pulled back in a ponytail. He wore a T-shirt that read “THERE. Now I’m not naked anymore.” Even though the hit men are fictitious, the danger is real. In 2016, Stephen Allwine, a Minnesota IT specialist and a deacon at his church, paid at least $6,000 on a Yura site to have his wife killed; after the hit failed to happen, he murdered her himself. (Allwine is serving a life sentence.) Monteiro doesn’t always send tips directly to law enforcement because he finds investigators can be put off by the complexity of the cases and the fact that they’re based on hacked information. But in 2021, he managed to get the FBI’s full attention. Monteiro was working with a podcast-production company on a murder-for-hire program for the BBC. The show’s producers began feeding the FBI details of murder orders that Americans were placing on Yura’s sites. Agents arrested a woman in Wisconsin who had tried multiple times to hire someone to kill her ex-husband; a physician in Spokane who wanted someone to take his estranged wife hostage; a man in Tennessee who sought to snuff out his wife; and an accountant in Tampa who paid $12,000 in bitcoin to kill her ex’s new spouse. On September 2, one of Monteiro’s tips landed on the desk of Brian DeCarr, an agent in the FBI field office in Albany. The Corderos were now living in nearby Hoosick Falls. The next day, DeCarr drove out to tell Christina that someone was trying to kill her. When she found out that Pence was a suspect, she couldn’t believe it. She and Cisco had plans to visit the Pences in Utah at the end of the month; they were supposed to meet at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City. “I was like, ‘No, there’s no way,’” she said. “‘Please make sure my children and their adoptive family are safe, because whoever wants me dead might go after them too!’” On October 27, exactly three years after picking up the Cordero children in Massachusetts, Christopher Pence’s alarm went off, as always, at 5:55 a.m. Lights flicked on, first in his en suite bathroom as he left Michelle in bed to nurse their infant daughter, then in the rest of the house as he woke his children in turn. He gathered most of them on the first floor for Bible study. (The three oldest Pence daughters were spending the year at Jackson Bible College in Wyoming.) They took a moment to sing “Happy Birthday” to one of the children and said an opening prayer. Twenty minutes later, there was a loud bang on the front door. At the same instant, the house was flooded by emergency lights. Christopher opened the door to see a black shield and more than a dozen officers wearing body armor, some holding assault rifles. “It felt like Armageddon had come to my front door and I was the only one standing in the way,” he later said. If Christopher knew why the FBI was there, he didn’t show it. A few minutes later, he agreed to speak with DeCarr in the privacy of a Chevy Tahoe parked in the driveway. The sun was still hidden behind mountains to the east and the temperature was near freezing as the men got inside. Chris Andersen, a Utah-based FBI agent, climbed into the back row while DeCarr and Pence sat side-by-side in the middle. “I’d love to know what’s going on,” Christopher said as a recorder captured the conversation. “You’re not under arrest at all. That’s not what we’re doing,” DeCarr replied. “You’re under no obligation to talk to us. We would appreciate your help, okay?” They started by asking Christopher about his job at Microsoft, life in Washington, his marriage. Shy by nature, Christopher seemed almost to enjoy the agents’ company, talking as if they were three dads standing around a grill on a Saturday afternoon. How much did Christopher pay to pave this driveway? Do the AC units on top of the motor homes need Freon? Does Christopher plan to fix up the ’66 Mustang sitting over there? Did he catch babes in that thing? Christopher seemed especially interested in telling the agents about the adoption. “Do you want the long story or the short version?” he asked them. “Give me the long one,” DeCarr said. Pence described his and Michelle’s desire to adopt, the road trip to Massachusetts, locusts in Texas, how the Corderos became too big a presence in their lives. The agents seemed sympathetic to Christopher’s frustrations. As the sun came up and warmed the Tahoe, Christopher unlocked phones and provided passwords to his computers and tablets. After about 90 minutes, DeCarr presented Christopher with a mountain of electronic evidence connecting him to the murder-for-hire payments. “You are the protector of these kids, okay? You are the savior of these kids, and you do this for the family. And it’s clear to me — I didn’t understand why before — but it’s very clear to me that you would do anything for these children,” DeCarr said. “What got you to the point where you felt like you needed to have them killed?” Christopher fought back tears. His deep voice splintered. “On more than one occasion the children have been abused, um, through discipline, through the birth parents …” Gasping and choking back sobs, he strung together half-allegations against the Corderos and again tried to come up with an answer. “You were doing what you had to do,” DeCarr said. Satisfied he had a confession, he read Christopher his rights and exited the Tahoe to call New York for an arrest warrant. Even after it was clear the FBI had deceived him into talking, Christopher thanked the agents for “doing what you’re doing.” He continued to be unfailingly polite, exuding the same eerie cheeriness that tinged his messages on the murder-for-hire website. As they waited, an officer marveled at the children inside Christopher’s house, who were playing music and helping cook breakfast. “Maybe there is something to be said about not letting all the outside influences corrupt their minds, right? I mean, I don’t know what my daughter would do without TikTok on her cell phone,” he said. Christopher laughed. DeCarr returned to inform Christopher that he was under arrest. “Have I ruined my life?” he asked. In late 2023, Christopher Pence pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting murder via the internet. Christina told me that since Christopher’s arrest, Michelle has refused to allow her or Cisco to have any contact with their biological children. In April, however, the Corderos got a brief glimpse at Christopher’s sentencing. Their kids were seated with Michelle as if in support of the man who’d tried to have their biological parents killed. At the hearing, which was held in Utica, U.S. District Judge David Hurd said he was troubled by how much the case stood out from past murder-for-hire affairs he’d seen. “Each one involved a defendant who was a longtime criminal, who had a bad record, and it was not particularly surprising that he or she would hire somebody to kill others. This case is different,” he said. “It’s a very difficult case.” Hurd sentenced Christopher to seven years. He could be released from prison toward the end of 2028. He will have missed 112 of his children’s birthdays, but at 48, with his youngest child just 7 years old, he could have a lot of fathering left. Whether he will be allowed to leave prison and pick up where he left off, fathering his adopted children, is complicated. Michelle and Christopher are still the children’s legal guardians, but it would take one phone call to child welfare upon his release to trigger an investigation into the safety of the children under his care. Such an investigation is unlikely to consider that Christopher’s purported motive for committing the crime was the children’s welfare. If a judge believed the children under Christopher’s care were in danger, they could place the underage kids, both biological and adopted, in foster care. Just as likely, a judge could give Michelle an ultimatum: the kids or Christopher. For the time being, Michelle is caring for all of the children. When I called her on a recent school day, she declined to speak with me, saying there were too many demands on her time. (She didn’t respond to follow-up requests or fact-checking queries.) She tried, briefly, delivering groceries and now depends on donations from the Cedar City community. A few of her children have found work at a small manufacturing plant in town. “For now the plan is to continue homeschooling. For now the plan is to keep things as stable as possible. For now the plan is to take the next step in faith and accept the grace God gives at each turn,” Michelle wrote on Facebook shortly after Pence’s arrest. “God is good all the time.” By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
36,Margaret Hartmann,‘Horrible City!’: Why Trump Trashed RNC Site Milwaukee,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/horrible-city-trump-milwaukee.html,"Trump called Milwaukee, the site of the Republican National Convention, a ‘horrible city’ while meeting with the House GOP. He may think he won’t be at the RNC because he’ll be on house arrest. Or he might just despise Wisconsin.",2024-06-13T19:58:00Z,"You don’t have to be an expert political strategist to know that presidential candidates shouldn’t call any American city “horrible.” That’s particularly true if the city in question is in a battleground state. And it would be lunacy to denounce the site of your upcoming party convention. Yet that’s exactly what Donald Trump did on Thursday morning: 🚨TRUMP TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS:""Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city."" So what was Trump thinking? Here are three possible explanations. . Trump didn’t publicly bash the largest city in Wisconsin. He made the remark during a closed-door meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, D.C. It’s possible that he trusted his Republican pals to keep his remarks private, but it seems some Judas in the GOP conference leaked them to Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News. . Wisconsin congressmen and GOP officials offered at least four different explanations for Trump’s remarks, ranging from outright denial to claiming he was calling some specific aspect of Milwaukee “horrible,” not the whole city. Three Wisconsin Republican congressmen with three different stories about Trump calling Milwaukee a “horrible city.” pic.twitter.com/wEzcXddAbt GOP appears to be scrambling to spin. A convention spokesperson told me Trump ""was referencing the ongoing political game the City and County are playing with Pere Marquette Park. Despite concerns being raised months ago, the City has still not designated a first amendment zone."" https://t.co/mWiFa8cS1T . Perhaps Trump purposely insulted Milwaukee because he’s laying the groundwork for skipping the Republican National Convention. Trump’s sentencing in the New York hush-money case is on July 11, just four days before the start of the convention. NBC News reported on Thursday that the convention is being set up so Trump can participate virtually, in case he’s sentenced to home confinement (other possibilities include a fine, probation, or even jail time): Preparations are being made at both Mar-a-Lago, his home in Florida, and in Milwaukee, the host city for the convention next month, should Trump either choose to make appearances from afar or be unable to attend, according to two sources familiar with the planning. A Trump-campaign senior adviser denied this, telling NBC News, “At no time has convention planning involved any option than President Trump in person to accept his formal nomination as president.” But other sources said the Republican National Committee is setting up a giant screen at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum, along with stages that match the convention theme at Mar-a-Lago, in case Trump can’t go to Wisconsin or just doesn’t feel like it: The Republican operative who viewed the convention site said that the idea of Trump’s being under house arrest was not discussed during tours in Milwaukee and that people were told there is a chance Trump could just choose to hold convention-related events from Mar-a-Lago.  A Trump campaign official, though, confirmed to NBC News that the idea that he could be under house arrest for the convention is part of the planning process.  Trump can now save face by claiming he didn’t want to go to a “horrible city” like Milwaukee anyway. . Trump has been “negging” Wisconsin since the run-up to the state’s 2016 GOP primary, as Mother Jones observed at the time: Trump has made a habit of dissing the current condition of things in Wisconsin to promise a brighter future when he’s president. …  “I’ve got statistics on Wisconsin that are unbelievable,” Trump said [at a rally in Racine], breaking from his typical off-the-cuff speech to glance at some notes. “You think we’re doing nicely and everybody thinks they’re doing well, but I have some statistics. You could write out some of the numbers—you look at your manufacturing jobs, you know better than anybody how they’ve gone to other countries. They’re gone. I mean, they’re literally gone.” “I thought Wisconsin was doing well,” Trump concluded, “and it’s not true! It’s oookay, it’s in the middle of the pack. Nothing spectacular.” Despite routinely insulting Wisconsin, Trump won it in 2016. But in 2020 Joe Biden flipped the state by an extremely narrow margin (0.63 percent). Trump challenged the results, but a recount only reaffirmed Biden’s win. Trump may still be seething about getting burned by Wisconsin voters. At a rally last month in Waukesha, he lightly threatened Wisconsinites while discussing the upcoming convention. “As you know, we’ll be holding our convention in Milwaukee just a few months from now and we can’t wait,” Trump said. “That means you got to vote for us because we are spending our money in your state to have the big convention. We had lots of options, and we’re coming here.” While he didn’t say anything overtly insulting back then, it was hard to miss the disappointment in Trump’s voice as he considered all the convention sites that are less “horrible” than Milwaukee.

37,John Herrman,The Other Big Problem With AI Search,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/perplexity-demonstrates-the-other-big-problem-with-ai-search.html,"Forbes has called out Perplexity after the AI search engine’s Pages tool plagiarized some of its articles. The episode, and the stance of CEO Aravind Srinivas, shows why publishers are rightfully concerned AI firms will just steal their work.",2024-06-14T12:00:29Z,"In recent months, Forbes has published a series of deeply reported stories about Eric Schmidt’s stealth drone project. They’re a fascinating window into the former Google CEO’s budding new career in Defense contracting — and you can read them here. Last week, reporters who worked on the stories reported something else: an AI-generated article-length summary of their work. The post contained sections of text copied verbatim from the paywalled Forbes stories, as well as a lightly modified version of a graphic created by the Forbes design team. It had been created with Perplexity Pages, a tool recently introduced by the AI search engine of the same name — a buzzy and popular product with a billion-dollar valuation. The post was featured on Perplexity’s Discover page, sent out via push notification to its users, incorporated into an AI-generated podcast, and released as a YouTube video. The article had garnered more than 20,000 views, according to Forbes, but didn’t mention the publication by name, instead crediting the original stories alongside other aggregations of their material in a series of small, icon-size links. Forbes publicly objected, reporting that Perplexity “appears to be plagiarizing journalists’ work,” including but not limited to its own. In a separate story, editor and chief content officer Randall Lane made his position clear: “Perplexity had taken our work, without our permission, and republished it across multiple platforms — web, video, mobile — as though it were itself a media outlet.” In response, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas told Forbes that the Pages product has “rough edges” and that “contributing sources should be highlighted more prominently.” In a later post on X, he took a more defensive position: Perplexity has been the #2 referral source for Forbes (behind only Wikipedia) and the top referrer for other publishers. We have been working on new publisher engagement products and ways to align long-term incentives with media companies that will be announced soon. Stay tuned! https://t.co/Y2spv2l5Tb pic.twitter.com/4IWPT9VI42 To anyone who has ever seen real internal publishing metrics, this was an obviously absurd claim. Forbes reporter Alexandra S. Levine confirmed, in response, that in fact traffic from Perplexity accounted for just 0.014 percent of visitors to Forbes — making it the “54th biggest referral traffic source in terms of users.” Perplexity is getting a lot from Forbes, and Forbes is getting basically nothing back — a significant downgrade from the already brutal arrangements of search, social media, and cross-publication human aggregation. With pages, Perplexity wasn’t just offering to summarize sources into a Wikipedia-ish article for personal consumption. The Pages feature is intended to “turn your research into shareable articles, helping you connect with a global audience.” (The Forbes summary was in fact “curated” by Perplexity itself.) It’s an attempt at automated publishing, complete with an internal front page and view counts. Pages isn’t Perplexity’s main product, but rather a new feature that extends its basic premise. Perplexity is, to most of its users, a Google alternative with a simple and appealing pitch: In response to queries, it provides “accessible, conversational, and verifiable” answers using AI. Ask it why the sky is blue, and it will give you a short summary of Rayleigh scattering with footnote links to a few reference websites. Ask it what just happened with Hunter Biden, and it will tell you the president’s son “has been found guilty of lying on a firearm application form and unlawfully possessing a gun while using drugs,” with footnoted links to the Washington Post (paywalled) and NBC News (not). Perplexity occasionally makes things up or runs with a summary based on erroneous assumptions, which is the first problem with LLM-powered search-style tools: Where conventional search engines simply fail to find things for users or find the wrong things, AI search engines, or chatbots treated like search engines, will sometimes just fill the gaps with nonsense. On its own terms, though, the product works relatively well and has real fans. Its interface is clean, it isn’t loaded with ads, and it does a decent job of answering certain sorts of questions much of the time. Its answers feel more grounded than most chatbot responses because they often are. They’re not just approximations of plausible answers synthesized from the residue of training data. In many cases, they’re straightforward summaries of human content on the actual web. For people and companies that publish things online for fun or profit, Perplexity’s basic pitch is also worrying. It’s scraping, summarizing, and republishing in a different context; to borrow a contested term of art from publishing, it’s engaging in automated “aggregation.” As Casey Newton of Platformer wrote after the company announced plans to incorporate ads of its own, Perplexity, which is marketed as an AI search engine, can be also reasonably described as a “plagiarism engine.” Automated publishing, in previous contexts, is better known by another name: spam. Again, Perplexity is growing fast, raising money, and is valued at more than a billion dollars. It has loyal users who are undeterred by the way it works, largely because it often does work — it’ll give you something close to what you’re asking for, quickly. That Perplexity’s search responses are short and presented individually leaves Perplexity with a few plausible defenses: It’s not much different from Google Search blurbs; it could conceivably send visitors to original content; it’s sort of akin to a personalized front page for the web populated with enticing blurbs; it’s no different from Wikipedia, which sources its material from the world of others; it’s no different from low-value human aggregation, which many in the aggrieved media have been practicing for decades. These defenses were never terribly convincing. Perplexity encourages users to ask follow-up questions, which leads it to summarize more content until it’s basically written an entire article anyway — as with chatbots, the product encourages users to stay and chat more, not to leave. They’re also defenses that Perplexity itself, at least until recently, didn’t see the need to mount. In February, when the company was breaking through into the mainstream, I asked Srinivas, a former OpenAI employee, where he thought Perplexity fit into the already collapsing ecosystem of the open web. His responses were candid and revealing. He described Perplexity as a different way not just of searching but browsing the web, particularly on mobile devices. “I think on mobile, the app is likely to deprecate the browser,” he said. “It reads the websites on the fly — the human labor of browsing is being automated.” For most answers, Perplexity would provide users with as much information as they need on the first try. I asked directly how publishers who either depend on or are motivated by visitors to their sites — to make money from them with ads, subscriptions, or simply to build a consistent audience or community of their own — should think about Perplexity, and he suggested that such arrangements were basically obsolete. “Something like Perplexity ensures people read your content, but in a different way where you’re not getting actual visits, yet people get the relevant parts of your domain,” he said. “Even if we do take your content, the user knows that we took your content, and which part of the answer comes from which publisher.” I suggested this was precisely the concern of people whose content Perplexity was relying on — that Perplexity’s unwitting content providers can’t survive on credit alone. Then Srinivas, who for much of the interview spoke thoughtfully and precisely about the state of AI and his company’s strategy for taking on Google, started thinking out loud as if encountering an interesting new problem for the first time from a perspective he hadn’t previously needed to consider. “We need to think more clearly about how a publisher can monetize eyeballs on another platform without actually getting visits,” he said. In a world where readers encounter publications as citations on Perplexity or in Google’s AI answers, “you can argue brand value is being built even more. We should figure out a way to measure, like, actual dollar value that’s obtained from a citation in a citation-like interface, so that an advertiser on your domain can still figure out what to pay.” There was no plan, in other words — as Perplexity sees it, this isn’t really their problem to solve, even if they’re helping to create it. In the AI-rendered future, publishing as it exists today makes no sense. Sure, this generation of AI tools is dependent in multiple ways on scrapable public content created under different cultural and commercial circumstances, but if the economy of the web collapses, and services like Perplexity don’t have much material to summarize … well, they’ll cross that bridge when they come to it. In the time since the interview, Perplexity has introduced Pages, suggested that it would get into advertising itself, and shifted its defense to talking about traffic that it doesn’t actually send. The company isn’t alone in this approach. Google’s AI overviews, which produce and cite content in a fashion similar to Perplexity, have been similarly criticized as plagiaristic and parasitic, not to mention sometimes glaringly wrong. In response, Google, which (mostly) successfully fended off related criticism for over-aggregation when it was relatively young, has claimed to an audience of publishers that has no reason to believe it, and very much doesn’t, that its users are actually very keen to tap those little citations on its synthetic summaries. On Wednesday, after the Forbes reports, Perplexity placed a story with Semafor that claimed it was “already working on revenue-sharing deals with high-quality publishers” at the time of the controversy and that it would unveil details soon. Perplexity’s about-face is at least some sort of acknowledgment that there is a problem, here with consequences that could eventually undermine not just publishers but the AI firms themselves. It helps explain why OpenAI, which is both a much larger company and a bigger target for criticism and legal action than Perplexity but isn’t nearly as entrenched as Google, has been pursuing deals with media companies, including New York parent Vox Media, for both training on and displaying their content. It also sheds some light on why publishers, with some exceptions, have been so keen to accept its terms: because the future first envisioned by AI firms didn’t include them at all.

38,Jonathan Chait,Hunter Biden Conviction Blows Up Republican Conspiracy Theories,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hunter-biden-conviction-blows-up-gop-conspiracy-theories.html,Hunter Biden’s conviction in Delaware over a minor charge disproves Republican claims that Joe Biden was running Trump’s Manhattan prosecution brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg.,2024-06-11T17:02:00Z,"Hunter Biden’s conviction in Delaware over a minor charge is significant mainly because it blows to smithereens the arguments Republicans have made on behalf of Donald Trump. There’s the small claim that Trump didn’t receive a fair trial, that blue-state juries can’t render impartial verdicts on famous political figures. Analysts predicted a jury in Delaware, a tiny state where everybody seems to personally know and adore the Biden family, would go easy on his son. But this failed to transpire. Most important is the idea that Joe Biden is personally “weaponizing” the justice system to target Trump. House Republicans devoted a hearing last week to pressing their unsubstantiated claim that Biden had orchestrated Alvin Bragg’s moves, as “evidenced” by Bragg’s hiring of an attorney with DOJ experience, a move they seem to believe is unusual. It is not just the Trumpiest conservatives who believe this. Mainstream conservative pundits routinely assert that “the Democrats” — not just one Democratic prosecutor — decided to lock up Trump. Four-fifths of Republican voters, according to a recent poll, believe the decisions to prosecute Trump in New York came “from the Biden administration,” not from “prosecutors in New York.” To hold this theory together — which, again, is the belief held by a supermajority of Republicans, not just the Glenn Beck audience — you have to believe Biden is directing the activities of local prosecutors while exerting no control at all over the Justice Department of the branch of government he presides over. Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a form he submitted to purchase a firearm, which his wife quickly found and threw away without its ever being used. Elie Honig has argued that these charges, while legally valid, are the sort of case prosecutors would normally ignore. Where are the legions of conservatives hysterically warning about rogue prosecutions? I believe balance dictates that we are due for several thousand incantations of Lavrentiy Beria’s infamous quote “Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime.” Sadly, conservative media, which had previously treated Hunter Biden’s addiction-fueled problems as America’s most pressing issue, have found his case less compelling even as its legal phase reached its climax. “Where’s Hunter?” they taunted for months. Well, here he is, being held to the strictest legal standard by his father’s supposedly rigged Justice Department. And here is his father, mustering all the dignity he can to respect the verdict and even promise not to pardon his son. It could not be more obvious that one candidate in this race genuinely believes in upholding the rule of law, while the other is a criminal who wishes to regain control of the government to run it like a mafia state.

39,Matt Stieb,The Time Trump Held a National Security Chat Among Mar-a-Lago Diners,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-time-trump-held-a-national-security-chat-at-mar-a-lago.html,"In 2017 Donald Trump held a nuclear strategy session on the Mar-a-Lago patio, where he was dining with Shinzo Abe, after Kim Jong Un launched a missile test. It was an early indication of how crazy the Trump administration would get.",2024-06-09T10:00:33Z,"Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and his four years in office contained so much daily weirdness, wackiness, and horror that the human brain couldn’t comprehend it all. As Trump gets close to the White House again, “That Happened” brings you the surreal moments you might have forgotten — or blocked from your memory. Some of the most powerfully strange moments of the Trump administration need little context. I’m thinking here of the president’s lament to Ruth Bader Ginsburg set to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer.” Others grow richer in meaning over time. I’m thinking here of the time Trump held a top-secret national security meeting about the North Korean nuclear threat among a bunch of people eating on a patio at Mar-a-Lago. It was February 2017, the second month of his presidency, and Donald Trump’s national security apparatus was already in crisis. He was spending some time at his Mar-a-Lago resort, trying to decide if he should fire a guy named Michael Flynn — a former general who proved in just a few weeks that he was wholly unfit to serve as national security adviser. To blow off steam, the president decided to go golfing with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who was visiting at the time. But hours later, Trump faced one of the first crises of his young administration. North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un had launched a surprise intercontinental ballistic missile test, and Trump had to decide what to do. Worse, this was all happening during Trump and Abe’s dinner. Amid resortgoers overpaying for Mar-a-Lago steaks, with a piano player plunking at a keyboard, national security adviser  Flynn and White House adviser Steve Bannon gathered close to Trump and splayed out documents on the table. CNN reports that the dinner continued: The leaders’ wedge salads were cleared, and Trump and Abe’s main course brought out, possible looming nuclear war be damned. The patio was lit only by candles, so aides held up their phone flashlights — and nearby diners said they could see everything. On social media, visitors posted photos of the extremely unsecure security incident, including a shot of the U.S. official responsible for carrying the “nuclear football” — the briefcase containing the launch codes that could send the world into oblivion. Thankfully, Armageddon did not begin that night. But the episode did give Americans a taste of how insane the Trump administration would be on a near-nightly basis. Looking back, though, everything about it becomes stranger and more tragic. There is the reality that three of the men at the table have been charged by the federal government: Flynn for making false statements to the FBI, Bannon for a bunch of stuff, and Trump also for a bunch of stuff — including using Mar-a-Lago bathrooms as a sort of dumping ground for top-secret information after his presidency. (Perhaps we should have seen that coming given this event.) There is the fact that this was one of Shinzo Abe’s last visits to the United States before he was killed by a home-made-blunderbuss-wielding assassin. Perhaps the strangest thing about all this is Trump’s ever-evolving relationship with Kim Jong Un. After early back-and-forths that devolved into “fire and fury” threats, Trump met with Kim in 2018 and reported that they “fell in love.” Some of their letters were even reportedly among the presidential documents seized from Mar-a-Lago in the federal raid in 2022. And now, Trump says a second term is the only thing that stands between the world and the prospect of nuclear destruction. That’s not an exciting prospect, except maybe to Mar-a-Lago diners.

40,Ed Kilgore,Can We Actually Do Better Than Roe v. Wade?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/can-we-actually-do-better-than-roe-v-wade.html,"Can we actually do better than Roe v. Wade? The 1973 decision was always flawed. But two years after Dobbs, it’s clear Roe v. Wade shouldn’t be entirely dismissed as a model for restoring abortion rights.",2024-06-10T10:00:45Z,"As we approach the second anniversary of the shocking landmark Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which swept away any federal constitutional right to abortion, there’s a growing sense among abortion-rights activists that any future template for protecting reproductive rights will need to go well beyond Roe v. Wade. While Roe (and its successor case Planned Parenthood v. Casey) protected women from state laws prohibiting abortion, there were obviously some shortcomings in the rules established by the Supreme Court decision that could theoretically be addressed in the future. Unfortunately, it’s unclear if and when a stronger (and more durable) set of protections will become possible in this country. For all of its 48 years as the law of the land, Roe drew friendly fire from abortion-rights advocates who lamented its scope and vulnerability. To begin with, Roe’s foundation in constitutional law was always controversial. It rested on a non-enumerated right to privacy in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and a particularly shaky set of precedents, notably Justice William O. Douglas’s 1965 opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut striking down state contraception bans. No less a feminist than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg famously frowned on Roe’s constitutional reasoning and argued that the Equal Protection Clause and a right to gender equality would have been sounder. Roe also established an awkward trimester framework for state abortion restrictions, forbidding them in the first third of pregnancy; allowing health regulations in the second; and permitting total bans with life-and-health exceptions in the third. This was always confusing and counterintuitive, and while the simpler fetal-viability red line created by the Casey decision in 1992 solved that problem, Casey substituted an “undue burden” test for pre-viability abortion restrictions that let states constantly experiment with hostile regulations and discourage abortion providers. Either way, abortion care was treated more as a contingent privilege than as a personal right. As my colleague Irin Carmon pointed out after Roe was reversed and Republicans began talking about finding a “compromise” policy, Roe (and even more obviously Casey with its slippery “undue burden” standard) itself represented a compromise between the idea of a woman’s rights and the state’s “interest” in fetal life, creating judicial balancing tests that varied by court or jurisdiction. This scheme, says abortion rights advocate Erika Christensen, “accepts the premise that there’s a reasonable point in pregnancy in which the state should be given authority to compel breeding.” Debating where that point falls gives away a lot of ground to the anti-abortion movement. Beyond its questionable treatment of abortion as something less than a right, Roe also failed to make abortion services actually available on anything like an equal basis. Three years after Roe was handed down, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment, banning the use of federal funds to pay for abortions in all but an extremely limited number of cases. After an extended battle through the federal judicial system, a 5–4 majority of the Supreme Court in Harris v. McRae upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, which has been subsequently renewed (with minor adjustments in scope) by Congress in appropriations measures ever since. When combined with the limited reach of abortion providers, particularly in the conservative states that constantly did battle with them, the Hyde Amendment meant that during the Roe era the “right to choose” was at best theoretical for millions of women, particularly women of color and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Still another charge against the Roe regime that became especially widespread after it collapsed is that it instilled a sort of complacency among pro-choice Americans and particularly in the Democratic Party, which had gradually become a pro-choice party facing an increasingly militant anti-abortion GOP. Certainly, any complacency was ill-founded, particularly after the big scare in 1992, when a Supreme Court that seemed poised to reverse Roe instead confirmed it thanks to a last-minute coalition put together by Reagan-appointed Justices Sandra Day O’Conner and Anthony Kennedy. More appropriately, you could argue that dependence on the Supreme Court for any sort of abortion rights made the battle remote and inscrutable to voters for whom constitutional law is a foreign language and the process for choosing and confirming Supreme Court justices is as obscure as Hammurabi’s Code. So now that Roe is gone, should it also be forgotten? Should its abortion protections with all their limitations be placed on the ash heap of history in favor of something more satisfyingly sweeping and principled? And can we look forward with confidence to a day when safe and affordable abortion services are available from sea to shining sea? Unfortunately, that’s not likely in the cards in the immediate future. Rebuilding a Supreme Court majority that favors restoring any sort of federal constitutional right to abortion will likely take many years, and if the goal is a more comprehensive guarantee than Roe provided, the wait could be perpetual. The very best-case scenario in the courts is a reversal of Dobbs as a historic aberration that violated the doctrine of stare decisis and a return to Roe and Casey. A more direct path to federal abortion rights is through Congress and a law that preempts state abortion restrictions. The preeminent model for such legislation is the Women’s Health Protection Act, which passed the House on a near-party-line vote in September of 2021 but was killed by a Senate filibuster in February 2022. The WHPA (unlike the marginally bipartisan Reproductive Freedom for All Act, which seeks to turn back the clock to the day before Dobbs) improves on the Roe regime by clearing away the sneaky and troublesome state restrictions allowed by the Supreme Court after Casey. But it retains the fetal-viability standard and doesn’t ensure public funding of abortion services. More importantly, enacting it would require a Democratic trifecta in Washington and then either a supermajority in the Senate or a Democratic majority willing to abolish or significantly modify the filibuster. None of these ingredients will necessarily be in place in the near future, and even if they were, a Republican trifecta in Washington could reverse it entirely (particularly if Democrats first took care of the filibuster). While a restored federal constitutional right to abortion seems unlikely in the near term, it’s a different matter at the state level. Courts in nine states have recognized some sort of Roe-style (or in some cases less sweeping than Roe) right to an abortion in state constitutional provisions protecting privacy or bodily autonomy. Voters in the pro-abortion-rights bastions of California and Vermont have approved constitutional amendments with broader provisions than Roe, discarding, for example, the viability standard; voters in Michigan approved an amendment modeled on Roe. State constitutional amendments via citizen initiatives are working their way toward the ballot box in multiple states this year, though most are shaped after Roe. Many abortion-rights advocates are unhappy with Roe-style amendments for all the reasons discussed above, but politically it’s clear that Roe is familiar to voters in a way that more thoroughgoing guarantees simply aren’t. While pro-choice ballot initiatives are undefeated since Dobbs, sooner or later they will hit the wall in more conservative states. And that will leave a situation where in significant portions of the country there is little or no meaningful access to abortion at all. Right now, all or virtually all abortions are banned in 14 states. There’s a shred of federally guaranteed access to abortion in emergency medical situations, but the U.S. Supreme Court could kill that any day now. And another way around state bans via mail-order abortion pills is under attack at the Supreme Court as well and would definitely be closed off in part or in whole if Donald Trump returns to the White House. Over time, there’s a real chance that a sense of complacency far worse than that induced by Roe will fall over blue states where abortion remains available, while women in red states are left to the harsh ministrations of Republican governors and legislators. While bringing back Roe in its full federal constitutional splendor is unlikely any time soon, its benefits should not be gainsaid, nor its value as a model for congressional or state action dismissed out of hand. For 48 years, there was no place in America like Texas, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, or Tennessee today, where women must resort to illegal abortions or flee their home state for medical treatment. Right now, there is a national majority outraged by the reversal of Roe and prepared to support its restoration at either the federal or the state level. And for all its limitations, a right to pre-viability abortions (with exceptions for the life and health of the woman involved) covers an estimated 99 percent of abortions, which may not be as philosophically or morally satisfying as an absolute right but is close to it in practice. Restoring Roe in some form is probably going to be the best and only way to protect abortion rights in America across geographical and even party lines. So the hoary precedent deserves some respect.

Last week, there were reports that the NYPD intends to revoke Trump’s license to carry a gun in the city. On Monday, Trump will mark another milestone: his first meeting with a probation officer. NBC News reported that Trump was set to sit for a presentencing interview with a probation officer on Monday, ahead of the sentencing hearing on July 11. Unlike the average person facing sentencing, he won’t be required to travel into the city for an appointment. Instead, Trump has been given the option to appear virtually from Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. Trump’s attorney Todd Blanche will be allowed to attend the meeting, which is also unusual for the typical New Yorker facing sentencing; Judge Juan Merchan approved Blanche’s request, which received no objections from the prosecution. In the interview, Trump will likely be asked to provide a detailed history of his personal life, including his family, marriage, education, and employment and criminal history. This also includes looking into an individual’s health and psychological background and whether they have any history of alcohol or substance abuse, per the city’s Probation Department. Trump will have the opportunity to make a good impression and state his case for why he deserves a lighter sentence. The officer will then file a presentencing report, which will be used by Merchan in his decision-making as he considers the historic sentencing. The sentence could be hefty after Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records after directing Michael Cohen to pay $130,000 to Stormy Daniels in order to suppress her account of an alleged affair before the 2016 election. Trump has vowed to appeal the verdict and has been free without bail since his conviction. He faces up to four years on each count but could ultimately receive no prison time owing to his lack of a criminal record.

42,Margaret Hartmann,Trump Reminds Us He’d Rather Die by Electrocution Than by Shark,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/06/trump-reveals-hed-rather-die-by-electrocution-than-by-shark.html,"During a Las Vegas, Nevada rally Trump said he’d rather die by electrocution rather than shark attack. Incredibly he delivered the same incoherent shark speech last fall in Iowa. His sharks phobia is well documented on Twitter and by Stormy Daniels.",2024-06-10T16:46:00Z,"Donald Trump has made no secret of the fact that sharks are his greatest foe. While he’s never had his life threatened by marine animals, as far as we know, his alleged mistress Stormy Daniels claimed:“He is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks. He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’” And Trump has publicly attempted to start a feud with sharks — though in a cowardly move, he chose a venue that ensured he would not be gnawed on in response. Sorry folks, I'm just not a fan of sharks - and don't worry, they will be around long after we are gone. Sharks are last on my list - other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World! So on the one hand, it’s not that surprising that Trump ranted about how he’d rather die by electrocution than shark attack at a campaign stop this weekend. But on the other hand … I’m sorry, what? See for yourself: During a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday, Trump filled the crowd in on his preferred method of death, should he ever find himself on a sinking boat in shark-infested waters. “If the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking, do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted?” Trump said. “Or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted?” Trump is now ranting about batteries and shark attacks. I dare you to try to make sense of this. pic.twitter.com/G2ur6q47Ff Incredibly, this is not the first time Trump has mused about this at a rally. He debuted the shark-versus-electrocution tirade during a campaign event in Ottumwa, Iowa, back in October 2023. “If I’m sitting down and that boats’s going down and I’m on top of a battery and the water starts flooding in, I’m getting concerned,” Trump explained last fall. “But then I look ten yards to my left and there’s a shark over there. So I have a choice of electrocution or a shark. You know what I’m going to take? Electrocution. I will take electrocution every single time. Do we agree? Yeah, I will take electrocution.” Slurring his words, Trump starts riffing about how he would rather be electrocuted to death than be eaten by a shark. pic.twitter.com/yqPrxWRzN3 I know what you’re thinking: Surely the “Fake News” took this out of context. Trump only brought up sharks because a moderator asked him if he’d had any weird dreams recently, or someone in the crowd tried to get him to weigh in on the “horse-size duck versus 100 duck-size horses” quandary and bungled the combatants. But I promise you Trump brought up sharks on his own, for no apparent reason. To prove it, I transcribed the full three minutes leading up to his shark revelation in Iowa. During the part of his stump speech where he rails against electric cars and claims, falsely, that Joe Biden is dead set on making all military tanks fully electric and nonfunctional, Trump inserted some incoherent thoughts on boats: And the new one, I was in South Carolina the other day. Great boat manufacturer and he’s very concerned. Number one, they cut his thing down to two miles an hour even if you’re way out in the ocean. Two miles an hour! I said, “How fast can they go, like 40 and 50?” They wanted to go two until they get out to 90 miles. I said, “How far out do they go?” About 60 miles. I said, “You mean you can speed it up but you’ll never get out there?” That’s long 90 miles.   I looked at those boats. They look very safe but I don’t want to be 90 miles out. That’s a long way. But he said, “They want us to start thinking about going all electric for boats instead of Mercury engines.” Beautiful, made in the USA Mercury engines and others, where you smell that little smell that beautiful sound everything. They want to go all electric.  I said “What’s wrong?” They said, “Well the problem is the batteries are so heavy that the boat can’t carry them. They would sink. And if we did it where they could go for at least a moderate period of time they’d would be so big they’d cover the entire boat. And he said to me, he said, “You know, nobody’s ever asked me this question.” I said, “So what would happen if you’re in an all battery boat, the whole boat is practically battery?” You know these batteries are massive. Problem with the trucks is it takes up so much room too, with the trucks. I mean the whole thing is like a battery.   The whole thing is so crazy. You think if they had one three-minute sitdown with the truckers of America they’d understand it. And they do sort of understand it, but it doesn’t matter. It’s like open border. They understand open borders are no good. It doesn’t matter. You don’t see them closing the borders. They say, “Oh, we’re doing a wonderful job.” Fifteen million people are coming in. From prisons, from mental institutions, they’re coming in.   But I asked the boater. I said, “So let me ask you: Let’s say your boat goes down and I’m sitting on top of this big powerful battery and the boat’s going down. Do I get electrocuted?” And he said, “You know what, honestly nobody’s ever asked me that question.”   But if I’m sitting down and that boat’s going down and I’m on top of a battery, and the water starts flooding in, I’m getting concerned. But then I look ten yards to my left and there’s a shark over there. So I have a choice of electrocution or a shark. You know what I’m going to take? Electrocution. I will take electrocution every single time. Do we agree? Yeah, I will take electrocution.   But these people are crazy. They also want to go with energy-efficient jet fuel so that we don’t have any problems. Clearly, “these people” who want to explore electric-vehicle technology “are crazy,” not the guy who mused about being devoured by a shark in the middle of a campaign speech — and then repeated this incoherent rant seven months later for no apparent reason.

43,Nia Prater,Hunter Biden Convicted on Federal Gun Charges,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hunter-biden-convicted-on-federal-gun-charges.html,A Wilmington jury found the president’s son guilty on three felony counts connected to a 2018 gun purchase.,2024-06-11T16:14:00Z,"Hunter Biden was found guilty on all federal gun charges brought by his father’s Justice Department on Tuesday. A jury in Wilmington, Delaware, deliberated for just three hours after a weeklong trial that saw searing testimony from Biden’s own family about his crack-cocaine addiction. Biden’s legal team has previously indicated that they will appeal the verdict, which is punishable by time in prison. The verdict is the culmination of a long, messy legal and personal drama for Biden, 54, and his family resulting from a sprawling investigation that originally looked into Biden’s financial dealings overseas. (He is set to stand trial in the fall over separate financial crimes related to tax evasion.) Biden was indicted last year for making false statements while purchasing a firearm and for possession of a firearm by a drug addict or user, totaling three felony charges. Biden was accused of lying about his history of drug use on paperwork in October 2018 when he purchased a revolver from a Wilmington gun store. During the trial, prosecutors painted a portrait of Biden at the height of his addiction and presented as their key witness Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter’s brother, Beau. She testified about how she and Hunter fell into a short-lived romantic relationship following Beau’s death from brain cancer in 2015. She testified that Hunter introduced her to crack cocaine and she began using the drug, but later broke the habit. “It was a terrible experience that I went through,” she said. “I’m embarrassed and I’m ashamed, and I regret that period of my life.” Critically, they were together when Hunter purchased the gun at the center of the case while allegedly using drugs. Hallie discovered the weapon and later disposed of it. “I panicked,” she said, according to the Washington Post. “I didn’t want him to hurt himself and I didn’t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves.” The defense has sought to argue that it can’t be proven that Biden was using drugs at the time of his purchase of the gun in 2018. Biden’s eldest daughter, Naomi, testified for the defense, saying that she never saw her father use drugs and that he appeared to be in a good place during a 2018 meeting at a coffee shop. “He seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died, and he just seemed really great,” she said. But texts between the two during that same time period suggested that Biden was sometimes unresponsive and hard to reach, prompting concerns from Naomi. “I’m really sorry, dad, I can’t take this,” she said in one text read aloud in court. “I don’t know what to say. I just want to hang out with you.” The two embraced after she left the stand. Biden nearly avoided a trial altogether after striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors in 2023 that would’ve had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges in exchange for sidestepping a felony gun charge from the 2018 gun-store purchase. However, the deal fell apart during a July hearing after attorneys on both sides failed to come to an agreement on what was covered under the immunity portion of the terms. Biden has been a constant target of fruitless investigations led by congressional Republicans who have attempted to find a connection between him, President Joe Biden, and illicit dealings with foreign business — forming the basis for a brief, failed push to impeach the president. Though he refrains from commenting on the specifics of his son’s legal troubles, Joe Biden has consistently stood by Hunter, praising him for his resilience and his work toward his sobriety. First Lady Jill Biden attended most of her stepson’s trial, only missing one day to travel to France with the president for events commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day. In a statement released after the verdict came down, President Biden reiterated his support for his son. “I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that,” he said.

44,Ed Kilgore,The Supreme Court Didn’t Crush Abortion Rights for Once,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/supreme-court-abortion-pill-mifepristone.html,"In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a bid to restrict abortion-pill access on procedural (standing) grounds. But another decision is on the way involving emergency abortions.",2024-06-13T16:13:43Z,"Fears that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court would add a terrible new chapter to its legacy of reversing reproductive rights were held in abeyance for the moment as a unanimous Court rejected a bid by anti-abortion physicians to restrict the availability of the abortion medication mifepristone. But the decision did not touch on the merits of the petitioners’ claim that the Food and Drug Administration had erred in approving mifepristone originally in 2000, in relaxing conditions for its prescription in 2016, and in authorizing its distribution by mail in 2021. Instead, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion concluded the plaintiffs had no standing to raise this complaint because none of them were directly affected by the FDA’s authorization: [T]he plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone. And FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything. Rather, the plaintiffs want FDA to make mifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe and for pregnant women to obtain. Under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff ’s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue. The anti-abortion docs had already been denied standing to object to the 2000 FDA decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and SCOTUS basically knocked them out of court on the rest of their effort. The decision completed the reversal of their victory in district court, where notorious right-wing Texas-based Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk sided with them on both standing and the merits of their petition. There was one possible danger sign coming from the Court in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine: In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas objected more generally to past Court precedents conferring “third-party standing” on petitioners acting for others. This likely signals his continued determination to fight standing for abortion clinics suing on behalf of their patients in challenges to state abortion restrictions. The decision also does not necessarily end litigation over the availability of medication abortions — which now reportedly represent well over half of U.S. abortions. In particular, states that have banned or restricted every type of abortion will continue to fight prescription or distribution of such medications within their boundaries or by mail. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine is not, moreover, SCOTUS’s final word on abortion this term. The Court is also expected to determine whether there remains at least a shred of a federal right to abortion in a case involving Idaho’s efforts to interfere with emergency medical procedures to terminate dangerous pregnancies, which are arguably protected by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. SCOTUS unanimity on that case is extremely unlikely. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
45,Ed Kilgore,Could North Dakota’s Congressional Age Limit Start a Trend?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/north-dakota-congressional-age-limit.html,Could North Dakota’s congressional age limit start a trend? North Dakota voters approved a measure banning candidates over 80. It could lead the Supreme Court to reconsider a 1995 ruling invalidating such limits in which Clarence Thomas dissented.,2024-06-12T20:38:28Z,"Donald Trump had a nice June 11 primary day in North Dakota with his endorsed candidates for governor (Kelly Armstrong) and Congress (Judy Fedorchak) both winning handily. But it may have annoyed him that voters in that state approved a constitutional amendment that seeks to keep octogenarians out of the congressional delegation. The measure bans congressional candidacies by anyone who will reach the age of 81 by December 31 of the year preceding the end of their proposed term. That means neither Trump (who will turn 78 this week) nor Joe Biden (who is 81) could run for Congress in North Dakota this year. It wouldn’t directly affect current officeholders, as the New York Times noted: At the moment, the measure would actually have no bearing on North Dakota’s three current members of Congress, all Republicans, who range in age from 47 to 67.  Still, at least one of them, Senator Kevin Cramer, said he opposed the measure. “I can’t imagine why any patriotic conservative would vote to limit their choices,” Mr. Cramer, who is 63 and seeking re-election in November, said in an emailed statement. But the notably conservative North Dakota electorate approved the measure by a 3-2 margin. Now, you could just write this off as a symbolic gesture in a year when Biden’s age (and less so Trump’s) has gotten a lot of attention. And legal experts immediately observed that state efforts to impose new eligibility criteria on candidates for federal office were struck down in a landmark 1995 U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidating state-imposed congressional term limits. But the primary funder of the North Dakota age measure was the U.S. Term Limits organization, the losing party in the 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case. It seems entirely possible that term-limits fans are hoping for a fresh look at the constitutional question, either to validate an age limit or even a reversal of the ban on state-imposed term limits (it was a 5-4 decision). As it happens, the one Supreme Court justice who heard that 1995 case and is still on the Court is Clarence Thomas, who wrote a dissent. Knowing Thomas, he probably hasn’t found reason to reconsider his strong opinion back then: Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people. The idea of age limits on members of Congress is very popular beyond North Dakota; a Pew survey last October showed that 79 percent of Americans (including 82 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of Democrats) favor maximum ages for “elected officials in Washington, DC.” Around the same time, a University of Maryland survey showed that 83 percent of registered voters (including 86 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats) favor a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress. If a challenge to the North Dakota measure causes the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn its 1995 decision, there could be a mad scramble in the states to restrict the tenure of those universally mistrusted politicians in Washington. And that could be a big deal: 19 current members of Congress are 80 or older. All of them could be affected by term limits. So this development in North Dakota could bear watching. Yes, Biden and Trump are unpopular, but Congress is really unpopular: Per Gallup, that institution’s job approval ratio is 13 percent favorable to 81 percent unfavorable. Just about anything restricting the age or tenure of members of Congress is going to have fans across party lines. It may be up to the Supreme Court whether to green-light such measures, and we already know this particular Court isn’t strongly bound by its own precedents.

46,Sarah Jones,The Army Officer Who Resigned Over Gaza,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/army-major-harrison-mann-resign-gaza-israel.html,"Sarah Jones speaks with Harrison Mann, who resigned from the U.S. Army in protest of the government’s strong support for Israel’s assault on Gaza.",2024-06-13T10:00:15Z,"In May, Major Harrison Mann posted a letter to LinkedIn announcing his imminent resignation from the U.S. Army. He had served for 13 years and spent the past three posted at the Defense Intelligence Agency as a foreign area officer. After October 7, he had begun to feel complicit in a great wrong. Israel had responded to terror with a campaign of bloody collective punishment in Gaza, yet the U.S. government’s support for Israel remained unshakeable. “My work here — however administrative or marginal it appeared — has unquestionably contributed to that support,” Mann wrote. “The past months have presented us with the most horrific and heartbreaking images imaginable … and I have been unable to ignore the connection between those images and my duties here. This caused me incredible shame and guilt.” Mann submitted his resignation in November, and it took effect in early June. Now he has joined a small but high-profile series of official departures over U.S. support for Israel’s war in Gaza. Here, he speaks freely about his decision to leave the Army and publicize his resignation. Could we start with your decision to enter the military? What drew you to the service?Sure. This is a decision I made when I was in college. I’m somebody who went through high school and graduated high school near the height of the Iraq War. And without understanding, I think, all of the geopolitical or even domestic political aspects behind it, I just sort of understood, Okay. This is the big struggle of our time, and this is the thing that to serve my country I should participate in, in the larger global war-on-terror framework. That is what led me to start studying Arabic, which was the in-vogue language to study back then if you wanted to be a national security or defense person, and it was part of what drew me into the Army. I had this idea that it was going to be a really developmental experience and kind of toughen me up and be a really extraordinary experience I couldn’t get anywhere else. These were not the same decisions I would make today, but that’s what drew me when I was like 19 to start down this path. You served for the past three years at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Could you speak in broad strokes about what your responsibilities were?For most of the past three years, I worked at the Middle East Africa Regional Center of the agency, which is responsible mainly for producing intelligence analysis and reports on the Middle East and Africa broadly. So while I was there, I served in a number of administrative and leadership positions. I also served as an analyst myself for a while. For my last year, I was in the executive-officer position, which is essentially the assistant to the director of that entire center. So that’s a relatively senior intelligence official who oversees most of what the agency does related to that region. On October 7 and following that, it was a lot of, on my part, kind of behind-the-scenes work to help facilitate our crisis response. You touched on this in the letter you posted to LinkedIn, but could you say more about the ways you felt like the work you were doing for DIA had contributed to the U.S. government’s stance on Israel and Gaza?Well, this is actually a great week to talk about it because I think some of our very senior policymakers just announced that U.S. intelligence support contributed to the hostage-recovery operation that happened over the weekend in Gaza. That’s not necessarily what I worked on, but that is an example of how U.S. intelligence support can be very valuable to Israeli operations. The two countries have a very close intelligence relationship. Our Department of Defense and their Ministry of Defense have a very close relationship, and you can infer that the main intelligence entity, the Department of Defense, also has a close relationship with its Israeli counterparts. Could you walk me through the process of making this decision, starting with when you might have begun to feel misgivings about the U.S. stance post–October 7?I think immediately after October 7, anybody who follows this region, regardless of where they are ideologically, had this expectation that the Israeli response would be massive and violent. We saw in the first week after October 7 that the public statements of Israeli leadership indicated that they were interested in conducting some kind of collective punishment. They launched this air campaign where they were killing tons of civilians. So really from the first couple of weeks, it was clear that they were going to kill a lot of civilians, that that was not necessarily going to be accidental or a drawback for how they were conducting the operation. We saw the risk, which was manifested very early on, that this was going to provoke a violent regional response by other forces or adversaries in the Middle East, both against Israel and, more important, against U.S. forces. And that started pretty quickly as well. I think the first attacks from the Houthis and maybe also from Iraqi militias started sometime in October. And finally, amidst this, it was pretty clear that the Israeli government did not have a serious or realistic plan for conducting the war. They didn’t have an achievable end state that would allow them to declare victory and wrap this up, which is very troubling because it means the war can go on forever if you don’t have an actual achievable goal. Then, despite all of this, both at the public national level and what I was seeing where I worked, it was clear that U.S. support would be unlimited and was going to continue regardless of how Israel conducted the war, regardless of whether or not they had a plan, regardless of how badly things went. So that was communicated in the press by national leadership early on. It was also effectively communicated by the leadership in my community. It was clear that we were going to be along for the ride with whatever Israel did. As I’ve mentioned, even in the month of October, we basically saw the first bombings of hospitals. There was one, Al-Ahli, that we took a really close look at and ultimately determined that one was not Israel. But that was the last time we subjected large explosions in hospitals to any kind of scrutiny. After that event, I realized we were never going to really make a big deal about the Israelis bombing hospitals again, and it kind of sunk in that our support was not going to change. So at that point, I was confident in having the expectation that every day I stayed in the office, I knew what I would be contributing to. As you may also know, getting out of the military takes a long time if you’re an officer. So I told myself, Okay. Let me at least start my resignation now. And if nothing else, I can say I put in the paperwork in November, early on, and did the right thing. So that was that decision. You don’t give two weeks’ notice in the Army; it takes six months to a year. So I didn’t really have to do anything dramatic or make a big deal about it, and I didn’t explain the truth about why I was quitting. I was very afraid of how people would react because I wasn’t hearing anybody else expressing any concern and I knew I still had to be in the office for several more months. I thought, Well, that’s going to be really awkward and difficult if I tell everybody that I think we’re basically engaged in criminal activity here but then I still have to go to the office every day. I also held out a lot of hope, which became increasingly less grounded in fact and evidence, that maybe the war would end in some capacity. Despite all the really obvious and discouraging trends, I hoped that maybe somehow it would end or the U.S. would finally cut its support and then I wouldn’t have to worry about this. As you mentioned, I think, in your letter, you were leaving just shy of retirement. Was it difficult to reach the conclusion that this was what you needed to do?I think I already was not planning on staying for 20 years to retirement, but I did have some ambitions and interest in doing another assignment. Yeah, it was difficult to think I was permanently closing that door. My career specialty is normally people who staff embassies in the security cooperation office or the attaché office. And since I’ve been in that position before, part of the job is always that your local partners, the Army officers from the country you’re working in, are going to ask you about what’s going on in the United States and have questions about that. I tried to imagine how I would feel in an embassy somewhere — for me, it would only be the Middle East or North Africa — and having to answer questions from Arab officers about what we were doing with the Israelis in Gaza. And that I would be the one who had to carry water for that policy and how wrong that would feel. And I just kind of understood, I can’t be in that position. Was there an event or an incident when you knew the Biden administration was not going to reconsider its strong support for the state of Israel in this war?There were several, and I think I kept hoping against hope that they would reconsider. The first was when, after Al-Ahli, we stopped looking into any more hospital bombings. Just to be clear, Al-Ahli was not the Israelis, but there were many other strikes that clearly were. That was kind of one event. Then when the Israelis were clearly bombing the corridors they had told the Palestinians in Gaza to flee through, that was another. I think another big one was in January when we had the Tower 22 attack in Jordan that killed three Army reservists, which was done by I think Iraqi militias but was instigated in part by the Gaza campaign. That was a moment too where I thought, Okay, wow. We’ve had the first U.S. servicemembers killed as part of this conflict. Will this be an indication that we’ve gone too far? And no, it wasn’t. We bombed some people in Iraq and carried on business as usual. There was the World Central Kitchen strike that killed several western aid workers in Gaza. You may recall that was the biggest outcry and public outrage we’ve seen to date. I thought, Okay, wow. Maybe now they’ve done it. That didn’t change anything. I think that was a moment where I 100 percent lost hope, so I shared my letter with my office. Then as I was thinking and getting ready to share the letter publicly, we had the invasion of Rafah, which, of course, we’d said would be a red line. Then later that week, the president made a really unprecedented threat to curtail aid, and that also amounted to nothing. So with each of these, I went from hopeless to more hopeless. In your letter, you describe yourself as a descendant of European Jews. On that basis, what’s your response to arguments that Israel’s actions are necessary, that they’re defending Jewish life right now?Well, that’s just not true. The state of Israel’s actions have endangered Jewish life both in Israel and in the U.S. in ways that are unnecessary. The way Israel is conducting this war has prolonged it; it has incurred attacks from almost half a dozen different countries against Israel. On top of that, they are creating a situation where their children are going to grow up, I think, a lot like Russian children right now, which is they are going to find themselves in this pariah state. If they travel abroad, they’re going to feel embarrassed or like they need to conceal where they’re from. They’re going to just find themselves in this position that was totally preventable and that they didn’t have to be in and that they weren’t in even a year ago. And it’s not just the way they’re conducting the war but the rhetoric that both Israeli and U.S. leaders have used to frame this as a war for all Jews that I find incredibly dangerous. Because I’m an American Jew, I live in America, I’ve served the American government. And we have people who should know better saying they are carpet-bombing and starving Gaza on my behalf, and I didn’t agree to that. Describing the conflict in that way will inevitably make people associate me and American Jews with the crimes that are happening in Gaza. What would you say to people who may be in a position similar to the one you were in, who are wrestling with similar concerns and misgivings?Thank you for asking that. I think there are a lot of things you can do if you’re in the position I was in, and some of them I didn’t think of while I was there. I think resigning is great and can be effective. It’s the most effective way, if you feel like you’re complicit, to end your complicity. But I also understand that’s not a feasible option for a lot of people. Everything I’m going to list here, I know someone has done it or somebody is working on doing it. One of these options is applicable to you if you’re in my position. Short of resigning, folks can ask for transfers. They can tell their boss, “Hey, I’m going to keep doing 90 percent of my job, but the 10 percent that’s Israel support, find somebody else to do it.” I think it’s a good idea for people to do something I wish I’d done, which is express their concerns quite clearly to their supervisor or their chain of command and ask for assurance in writing that what they’re doing is legal, in compliance with both U.S. and international law, and in compliance with their organization’s code of ethics, which every military service and government agency has. I wish I’d done that because I think that would’ve given some leaders higher up the opportunity to reflect on exactly what they were asking people to do. For folks who feel they can’t do that, I think the bare minimum, which still can be difficult but is much better than doing nothing, is just talking with the people you work with. Because as I discovered, there are a lot of people who feel this way who are afraid to voice their opinion. And once one person brings it up, they’re going to find out they’re not alone, and they’re going to find out that maybe somebody else they work with not only feels the same way but is empowered to take one of the other actions I described. What did you hope to accomplish by making your resignation so public?Once I understood that, because of who I am, my resignation would garner some attention and I’d get to talk to people like you, I felt a little bit of an obligation because I felt there was more I could do. And I knew, at the very least, my resignation would help draw attention to the incredible cost of the policy we’re pursuing. I also really hoped it would help other people in my position to understand that they’re not alone and to start thinking about the options they have. I’m really pleased that it’s had that result, and I’ve had some people reach out to me because they saw my letter, they saw the stories, and they realized they could be doing more and wanted to figure out what their options were. Has anything surprised you about the reaction to your resignation?I don’t want to tempt fate here, but the lack of hate and criticism. Which is not to say there’s been none. But the responses I’ve gotten — including from people I worked with and people from my industry in general — have been so supportive and so positive. I started out going to work and feeling crazy because I was like, Wow, am I the only one who cares about what’s going on? After all this, I feel crazy for a new reason, which is, Oh, it turns out tons of people feel this way, but they’re all making this war happen anyway. So that’s a better place to be in. I think if I’d understood that six months ago, I would’ve felt much more confident in speaking out and trying to organize within my own workplace. So I think the extent of the sympathy that I found was surprising.

47,Nia Prater,Fetterman Had History of Speeding Tickets Prior to Weekend Crash,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/fetterman-had-history-of-speeding-tickets-before-new-crash.html,"The Washington ‘Post’ reports that Senator John Fetterman had been ticketed for speeding twice before his car accident in Maryland on Sunday, in which he was deemed ‘at fault.’",2024-06-13T20:22:48Z,"On Sunday, Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman and his wife Gisele were briefly hospitalized after a car accident on I-70 in Maryland. Per the Maryland State Police, Fetterman was driving a Chevrolet Traverse over the 70 mph speed limit when he rear-ended a Chevrolet Impala at about 7:45 a.m. The Fettermans and the driver of the Impala, an unnamed 62-year-old woman, were taken to the hospital, where Fetterman was treated for a bruised shoulder. (All three had been wearing seatbelts.) Authorities listed Fetterman as “at fault” for the collision. Neither driver was tested for alcohol or substances, the report said. It turns out Sunday’s accident is not the first notable incident in the junior senator’s driving history. The Washington Post reported Thursday that Fetterman has been ticketed for speeding twice in Pennsylvania, once in 2016 and once in March, when he was allegedly tracked at 34 mph over the speed limit. As a result of the March infraction, Fetterman was reportedly required to take a driver-improvement course. Fetterman’s erratic driving has prompted worries among his staff. According to the Post, aides try to avoid texting the senator when they know he’s driving after several people witnessed Fetterman taking video calls or sending messages from behind the wheel. An unofficial rule in Fetterman’s office holds that staffers don’t travel with the senator while he’s driving due to concerns about safety. Fetterman has also faced several medical challenges in recent years. In 2022, he suffered a stroke just days before he would go on to win the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat. A few months into his first term, Fetterman announced that he was checking himself into Walter Reed Medical Center to receive treatment for depression, an issue he has continued to raise awareness about in the weeks and months following his release. Fetterman appeared to make light of the incident on Monday, thanking his well-wishers in a video with his wife while holding a bag of frozen peas and a bottle of Tylenol. “Not the best way to spend our 16th wedding anniversary, but we’re doing well and happy to be back home in Braddock with the family,” he wrote on social media.

48,Ed Kilgore,"If Biden Isn’t the Democrats’ 2024 Candidate, Harris Will Be",http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/if-biden-isnt-the-democrats-2024-candidate-harris-will-be.html,"Fresh data indicate that Democrats like Kamala Harris, think she’s electable, and prefer her to rivals. They won’t dump her if for some reason Biden cannot serve as the nominee.",2024-06-13T20:50:26Z,"One of the stranger phenomena of this election year has been the chronic pundit talk of Joe Biden “stepping aside” as presidential nominee and Democrats replacing him with Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or some other sort of fantasy candidate. One of many reasons this scenario made little sense is that should something happen to convince the president to abruptly end his reelection campaign, he’s already chosen a stand-in who is very close by: his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Obviously, anyone willing to overlook Biden’s clear determination to stick it out this year can imagine Harris “stepping aside” — or being shoved aside — as well. But there’s really no evidence that the Democrats who would make this decision (the Biden-Harris loyalists who serve as convention delegates or on the Democratic National Committee) feel this way at all. And now there’s evidence that rank-and-file Democrats have the veep’s back. While a new Politico–Morning Consult poll with data about Harris shows that she shares her boss’s general election vulnerability, Democrats remain bullish on her. Seventy-four percent think she’d make a good president. By a 59 percent to 31 percent margin, they think she could win a 2024 general election. She’s stronger than Biden among the Black and Latino voters that have been stressing Democrats in recent years. And in terms of early 2028 preferences among Democrats, she’s far ahead of the competition (Harris is at 41 percent; Pete Buttigieg is at 15 percent; Newsom is at 14 percent; Whitmer is at 5 percent). Harris is already the principal voice of her administration and her party on the GOP threat to abortion rights, which will very likely become a more prominent issue as November approaches. She’s not going anywhere. None of this means that Democrats would want Harris to replace Biden, or that they might not harbor fears about Harris facing Trump. Bigots would definitely be mobilized by the prospect of a half-Black, half–Asian American woman (and one with a Jewish husband!) in the White House. But the idea that Democrats are ready to abandon her or Biden simply has no basis in verifiable fact. If, for some unforeseeable reason, Biden is incapacitated or decides to pack it in before November, Kamala Harris, for better or for worse, will be the Democratic candidate, period, full stop. Barring any clear evidence to the contrary, it’s time to forget about the fantasy tickets.

49,Kevin T. Dugan,The Economy Is Finally Becoming … Normal?,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-economy-is-finally-becomingnormal.html,"Inflation is falling, wages are rising, and the Federal Reserve is fixing to cut interest rates twice by 2025.",2024-06-12T20:02:39Z,"On Wednesday, something strange happened to the economy: For the first time since the dawn of the pandemic, it started to look, well, normal. Consider these three new pieces of data, all released within hours. The first was an inflation report, which showed that prices were rising at the slowest pace since last July — with grocery prices staying at a level lower than they were in February. Second, wages are still rising faster than inflation, which puts consumers on a better footing to afford their lifestyle. These two sets of data alone would be cause for great news. They show an equilibrium returning to the U.S. economy after years of bad vibes and trillions of dollars in stimulus extended our inflationary era past the three-year mark. And it didn’t even account for the fact that, across some of the biggest retailers in the country, prices are actually starting to fall. According to the latest BLS data, average real #wages have surpassed #inflation for 13 straight months. Real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth is a key indicator of how well the average worker’s wage can improve their standard of living.For more context: https://t.co/cJLzvwbpwG pic.twitter.com/jI44ixY7eA Then, the Federal Reserve — the most powerful government organ in the world economy — came out with what amounted to a sunny long-term weather report. It acknowledged there has been “modest progress” against inflation. Most Fed officials predicted the central bank will cut rates at least once by the end of the year, amounting to a quarter-point fall in benchmark interest rates. Practically, it would not be a giant change — the equivalent of $17 less per month for every $100,000 on a mortgage. But it signals that the economy is going in the right direction. By the end of 2025, there are likely to be four more cuts, the predictions show. Practically, it means that the era of high interest rates is soon going to end. Wall Street hardly reacted to the report, probably because one cut was broadly expected. But there is good reason to think that only a single cut actually undersells the optimism at the central bank. According to the Fed’s survey of its officials, the most popular position was for two cuts this year, even though there isn’t an outright majority of Fed governors who support it. The caveat is that we’ve seen this happen before, most recently in December, when Wall Street leaned too hard into an optimistic Fed report. At the time, the central bank was predicting three rate cuts this year, while banks and traders were calling for five or six. This rapidly went into reverse during the first few months of the year. For a while there, it looked like rates might not change at all. Larry Summers pontificated that they could even go up. For a couple of months, it was bleak. There are still plenty of questions outstanding about the economy. During a press conference after the data release, Fed chair Jerome Powell seemed less inclined than usual to give a sense of when there might be a cut — perhaps because stock and bond traders have had a tendency to frustrate him. Inflation could tick up again, which could derail plans to cut rates anytime soon.

But the headset is already changing disabled users’ lives.,2024-06-13T09:00:38Z,"In her childhood bedroom, Maxine Collard had a PC connected to a cathode-ray tube monitor so massive it bowed her desk into a smile that grew deeper every year. Collard has oculocutaneous albinism, which means that her hair is naturally bleach white, her complexion maximally fair, and she has uncorrectably low visual acuity with limited depth perception. In order to see the screen, she had to crane her neck until her face was two inches from the monitor. When Collard was in middle school, her mother bought an iMac for the family. Collard spent hours messing around on the new machine, her nose pressed almost to the glass. One day, deep in the computer’s accessibility settings, she discovered that if she held down the control key while spinning the mouse’s scroll wheel, she could instantaneously zoom the entire screen to whatever magnification level she wanted. There was a rudimentary magnifier app on her Windows computer, but she found the interface difficult to use, and the low-res image on the zoomed-in PC screen, she said, was pixelated, hard to read, “disgusting.” Her experience on the iMac, which allowed her to magnify the entire screen into a much clearer image, came as a revelation. Earlier this year, Collard had a similar aha moment when she tried the Apple Vision Pro for the first time. Some critics of the AVP were skeptical of a device that pressed two high-resolution micro-OLED screens within millimeters of one’s eyes for hours at a time. But to Collard, the ability to (as she put it) “strap an iPad to my face” was instantly appealing. Collard is now in her sixth year of a combined Ph.D.-M.D. neuroscience degree at UC San Francisco. When I visited her at her lab in late May, she showed me her workspace: a standing cubicle in a small hive of carrels she shared with her colleagues, a pair of 27-inch monitors on her desk. Zooming her entire screen has its liabilities in a social setting like this: One day she was reading her DMs on Slack, magnified so much that the words were two inches tall. A co-worker sent her a spicy message, something she would have preferred to keep private, or at least in 11-point type, but instead it was broadcast for all her colleagues to see. After she got an AVP, she had unprecedented control over her visual environment. She took her lab’s Slack channels and enlarged them to the size of a refrigerator, and set them off to her right. Then she opened her code editor and set it in front of her — inches from her eyes, like usual, but five times the size of her external monitors, and her posture was ramrod straight — no more craning. Finally, she opened a browser window, stretched it to the size of a door frame, and loaded the documentation for a tricky data-analysis function she could never remember, and set it off to her left. Collard has strabismus — her eyes don’t align the way typical eyes do — which would confuse most eye-tracking algorithms, but in the AVP’s accessibility menu, she turned on “single-eye tracking,” so the device wouldn’t get confused by eyes that point in different directions. The device can lessen the effects of her nystagmus — involuntary eye “wiggles” that have confounded eye-tracking devices she’s used in the past. The AVP has a range of accessibility features for other disabilities as well: Blind users can use VoiceOver, a screen reader that will speak text, using a custom set of hand gestures to navigate through apps. People with mobility disabilities can make selections through a variety of alternative methods: with their voice, or using a switch or joystick (easier for some users with motor disabilities), or with a feature called Dwell Control, which allows a user to make a selection simply by “dwelling” their gaze on an item. With sound actions, a user can make a selection with a custom noise (like a cluck or a pop). In lieu of eye gaze, the pointer can be controlled with one’s head, wrist, or finger, and most of the accessibility features users are familiar with from other Apple products — reduced motion, color filters for color-blindness, and hearing-device support — are included. Because of her reliance on large monitors, Collard could never comfortably join her colleagues to debug code in a coffee shop or in the shared kitchen one level down from their sixth-floor lab. That’s all changed with the AVP. “As a disabled person,” she wrote in a blog post, “the ability to finally sit back with my feet up on a bench out in the sun while working on my laptop — or more accurately, while working on a 30-foot-wide 4K screen floating in exactly the perfect ergonomic position, one that I can reposition anywhere I want it to be in any moment — is the answer to decades of prayers to the accessibility gods.” Mission Bay was warm and breezy in late May, and Collard led me down to Koret Quad, where she now loved to sit and work. Inside her headset, a code editor the size of a garden shed floated above the grass. As she worked, she saw the window begin to shimmer and a shadowy figure troubled the lines of code. Then a man, smiling and looking right at her, strode through the window of her workspace and stopped. This sort of thing happens to Collard whenever she takes her AVP out in public — she has caught numerous people taking surreptitious selfies with her in the frame. “Hi there,” she said preemptively to the smiling man, who was clearly drawn by the novelty of seeing an Apple Vision Pro en plein air. He looked at Collard and said, in a lightly mocking tone, “How’s that working out for you?” Collard has struggled with her identity as a disabled person, resisting alien-seeming assistive tools like the monocular lenses that low-vision specialists tried to get her to use in school. But she sees the AVP as a liberatory device, and no arch tech skeptic on the quad could dampen that feeling. She fixed his gaze with her digital SeeThrough avatar eyes and answered him with emphatic cheer: “Really great, in fact!” The initial response to the Apple Vision Pro has been mixed. There are widespread complaints about the headset’s weight and battery life and its price — $3,500 for the lowest-end model. Sales have reportedly been sluggish. Kevin Roose, a technology columnist for the New York Times, recently wrote that he “couldn’t really figure out what it was for.” For many disabled users, however, the answer is clear: The Vision Pro is made for them. About ten years ago, Steve Coulson, a creative director in New York, began losing his hearing, and today he has profound hearing loss. This made his work — constant in-person meetings, often in noisy environments — increasingly difficult. Like many people with disabilities, Coulson found the pandemic isolating, but he embraced certain elements of remote access: He had more control over the audio in virtual meetings, not to mention real-time captions and auto-generated transcripts. Still, he missed the easy, dynamic exchanges of his pre-pandemic brainstorms, and his hearing loss made it difficult to reproduce that feeling in person, even with hearing aids. Now, meeting with his business partner in Spatial FaceTime on Vision Pro, he says, the feeling he’d lost has been restored. “It feels like I’m in a room again,” he said. “We can just sit together in a meeting, and I can hear.” This technology, Coulson said, “is life-changing in a way that a hearing person might not understand.” Michael Doise, who works as an accessibility specialist and app developer in Austin, has optic-nerve hypoplasia — his optic nerves didn’t fully develop when he was born. When he’s with his family, he rarely sees their facial expressions, since it would be awkward to hold a portable magnifier up to their faces while they hang out. Even on his computer, he has trouble magnifying their images efficiently. But on a group video call, wearing his AVP, “I could actually see their facial expressions,” he said. “It’s a remarkable feat of engineering for someone who’s blind. Are they happy? Smiling? Knowing what all that looks like is huge for me.” Neurodiverse users have also found value in the AVP. “I generally feel a lot better after having worn it for a while,” a user with autism and ADHD told me. “It’s like a reset for the brain.” When I chatted with them, they’d just drained their AVP’s battery by spacing out in the immersive lunar environment. “My brain just is hyperfocused on whatever stimulus comes in, so whatever I can do to manually cut those stimuli off helps me tremendously,” they said. “The Vision Pro is noise-canceling headphones for my eyes.” Ryan Hudson-Peralta, who was born with no hands and short legs he’s unable to walk on, remembers his first computer, in middle school. He would go from class to class with a bulky ’90s-era Windows laptop on his wheelchair, typing notes and using rudimentary dictation software to complete his assignments. But he had to contort himself just to log in: “I was literally putting my lip on the control button, using my nose or arm to tap the other button,” he said. Then someone showed him an Apple computer, which had a function called Sticky Keys, allowing him to temporarily lock multiple keys on the keyboard, freeing him from gymnastic approaches to chorded commands. Today, Hudson-Peralta drives his adaptive SUV to his job in downtown Detroit, putting in long hours as a principal designer at Rocket Mortgage, where he designs the company’s apps and websites using a traditional mouse and keyboard and his Mac’s accessibility features. One morning this spring, though, his back flared with pain. “I was having trouble getting around that day,” he said, so he took the day off and did work for his consulting agency, Equal Accessibility, from bed, wearing the Vision Pro, surrounded by screens he controlled with his eyes and a series of custom mouth-sounds that triggered selections. “As I get older, and this happens more often for me,” he said, “I envision myself working virtually with the AVP even more.” For now, though, he mainly uses the AVP for entertainment, watching immersive videos on the headset, where he takes the perspective of a player running across a soccer field, or standing in a recording booth next to Alicia Keys. “Having a disability, I never ran in my life,” Hudson-Peralta told me. “I was sitting on the floor when I watched the Alicia Keys video, and I really felt like I was standing.” He knew it was an illusion, but the immersive tech gave the illusion a visceral veracity. I asked him what he thought of the disabled critique of Avatar, which seemed to suggest that its paralyzed protagonist’s life was only worth living when he was liberated from his wheelchair. He had no patience for this argument. “The other characters who could walk, they were jumping into avatar suits, too,” he said. The impulse toward escapism is universal. The same week I visited Maxine Collard at her lab at UCSF, I went to Cupertino to meet some of the disabled software engineers who’d helped build the accessibility features on the Apple Vision Pro. I was ushered inside Apple Park by a Deaf member of the company’s accessibility PR team who spoke to me through an ASL interpreter. Seeing my white cane, he explained that he was speaking ASL and that the voice I heard wasn’t his. (Though I’m legally blind, I have enough residual vision that I’d clocked the interpreter myself; still, I appreciated the gesture.) Strolling along the curved-glass perimeter of Apple’s massive ring-shaped corporate headquarters felt like walking on a treadmill. We ambled along for several minutes, the curved-glass wall unchanging on our left, the trees rolling languidly past on our right. I was there the week of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which Apple was observing, in part, by holding a series of internal-facing events to raise awareness among its 150,000 employees about their work in the field. It wasn’t inevitable that Apple would evolve to be so inclusive. Gregg Vanderheiden, an early accessibility consultant at the company, recalled a conversation he had with an engineer in the mid-’80s. The engineer confessed to Vanderheiden that he was worried he’d be fired for working on Sticky Keys. Vanderheiden asked why. “Because Sticky Keys is priority seven,” he replied, “and we’re under strict orders to focus on priorities one through three.” Today, the company seems truly committed to accessibility and not just for the goodwill it might generate. After all, one in four Americans have a disability — a market any corporation would be foolish to ignore. It required no great leap for Apple to serve this population: All technology, in the most basic sense, is prosthetic. We reached the conference center, where someone handed me an Apple Accessibility Passport, a single folded page with six colorful icons printed in a raised, textured material so they were tactilely discernible (and labeled in braille), representing the five main categories of Apple’s accessibility offerings: vision, mobility, speech, hearing, and “cognitive” — plus, perhaps a bit hopefully, a category devoted exclusively to Apple Vision Pro, which was represented on the passport by a raised-line silhouette of the goggles. The room was set up like a science fair with stations representing each category. After visiting each of the six stations, employees received a tactile bump-dot sticker to place on their passports. One of my minders, another member of the accessibility PR team, cheerfully insisted on applying my tactile bump-sticker every time I visited a booth. I smiled and nodded through our first stop at the Vision station as an Apple employee dutifully showed me how to use the magnifier app that I’d used at the airport that morning to read what was for me the illegibly distant menu at an airport café. Another worker showed me an iPad set to Assistive Access mode for users with cognitive disabilities. The normally dense screen of apps was reduced to five huge buttons, and each of these apps had its complex functions hidden or renamed. I saw a demonstration of how, using Apple Home and a smart bulb, d/Deaf or hard-of-hearing users can have their lamp change color when the doorbell rings or alert them visually or haptically to the sound of a baby crying or a fire alarm. Making my way around the stations, it struck me how many of these features were also available as specialty assistive devices. But these devices tend to be overpriced and undersupported, and their producers go out of business or stop supporting products with alarming frequency. It would cost me about as much as an iPhone to buy a portable video magnifier with all the features of Apple’s built-in magnifier app, and whatever advantages I’d find in a device built explicitly for a person with low vision I’d lose in my need to carry an extra gadget around. A speciality device would also inevitably have inferior construction, not to mention  the weirdness of pulling out an unfamiliar device in public, as opposed to the same little brick everyone else at the airport is waving around. The AVP isn’t as familiar as the iPhone, but, as I experienced with Collard, in public people are more likely to ask for a review than an explanation. Under the hood, however, it’s as specialized as any bespoke piece of disability tech. At the AVP booth, I met Dan Golden, a software engineer with low vision who works on accessibility at Apple across platforms. Golden told me that during the development process, he had trouble using eye-tracking. One of his fellow engineers was working on pointer control — a way of turning off eye-tracking on AVP and making selections by pointing one’s head. They shared this incomplete feature with Golden, who immediately began using it in his own testing of the device, in turn giving his colleague feedback to refine it. As Golden spoke, I was struck by his resemblance to Collard. His story echoed hers in many ways, down to the epiphanic childhood discovery of the iMac’s full-screen zoom shortcut, which a teacher showed him when he couldn’t follow the flying letters on a learn-to-type program. After that, he begged his parents for a Mac, and has been “an Apple person” ever since. There is an adage in disability-rights circles, “Nothing about us without us,” which suggests that the only way equity and inclusivity for disabled people — which is another way of saying real accessibility — will be realized is if people with disabilities are a part of the design process. Here, I felt with sudden force, was a stark instance of this ethos in action: a low-vision software engineer with strabismus who had helped to design and test the Apple Vision Pro, and on the other end of that equation was Maxine Collard, with a similar suite of disabilities, who could barely contain her enthusiasm at this tool that allowed her to do her work with a freedom and ease she’d never imagined for herself. This epiphany had, of course, been orchestrated for me by Apple, with its accessibility PR team guiding me through the experience room, stamping my passport, then introducing me to Golden, the visually impaired engineer. But both things could be true: This was well-orchestrated PR, but it was also a real part of Apple’s corporate culture. Nearly every blind person I knew had an iPhone because it provided unparalleled ease of access to information compared with any other option on the market. Online, disabled users still grumbled constantly — updates frequently break beloved features and often take too long to fix. Many blind people have wondered with annoyance why, for instance, a $3 trillion company can’t get the screen-reader on its desktop and laptop computers working half as well as it does on its phones. But these are largely the gripes of devoted consumers. The AVP is still a first-generation product, and there are bugs. Usman Haque, a Phoenix-based data-science manager at a large insurance company, also goes by @TwoFZeroT on social media — a.k.a. Two Fingers, Zero Toes. He’s a below-elbow, below-knee bilateral congenital amputee. Haque bought an AVP eager to test-drive its accessibility features. As soon as he turned it on, he said, “I was floored. I just spent $3,500, and I’m not giving it back. This is amazing.” That first impression, however, soon soured. The AVP calibration process requires its users to hold up their hands so it can recognize and begin tracking them for the pinching gestures that allow one to select items. But the AVP didn’t recognize Haque’s atypical hands, so he had his daughter stand behind him and pinch at the appropriate times to let him turn on Dwell Control. This worked well for a while, but often when Haque would wake the device after a break, Dwell Control would be deactivated and he’d have to go through a frustrating series of troubleshooting moves to turn it back on, sometimes needing assistance from his family. “I apologize for using this term,” he said, “but it felt crippling.” The device had offered Haque a thrilling sense of freedom, where he could control a vast, dazzling digital ecosystem with just his eyes — but then that freedom was suddenly yanked away. This was enough to douse his feelings of amazement. “It’s not ready for me yet,” he said. “I gave it back.” For Ryan Hudson-Peralta, the designer at Rocket Mortgage, his problems started with unboxing the AVP: he found that he couldn’t independently press the digital crown, which is required to set up the device. To generate his “Persona” — the uncanny digital avatar that the AVP shows to FaceTime callers when a user is wearing it — you hold it out in front of you, at arms’ length, so it can capture your likeness. But because Hudson-Peralta needed his son to hold it up for him, the angle was off, and as a result his Persona looks even stranger than most users’ — it erased his neck. Others are waiting for upgrades. Collard submitted a feature request to open up the AVP’s zoom feature to the pass-through cameras — at the moment, users can only magnify digital objects generated by the AVP and not their surroundings — like the departures monitor at an airport, for instance, or the text on a prescription-medication label. So far, Apple hasn’t changed the feature. At Apple Park, I walked with Dan Golden, the low-vision software engineer, into a conference room where Jordyn Castor was waiting for us on a FaceTime call from Colorado. Like Golden, Castor works on vision accessibility, doing quality-assurance testing. Unlike Golden, she’s completely blind and uses VoiceOver, the screen-reader that’s built into all of Apple’s operating systems, including on her Vision Pro headset. Castor told me that accessibility is a core value at Apple, a human right.  She described the exhilaration she felt using VoiceOver on the Vision Pro to demo a game that allowed her to play a virtual hand pan drum. She had the same wonder in her voice that sighted users express when the butterfly lands on their fingers in the device’s flagship demo, Encounter Dinosaurs. “I was playing the drums with my hands like I’m playing the drums on the table in front of me!” Castor said. “It was unlike anything I’ve experienced in the accessibility realm.” It’s easy to look at accessibility as a binary — a device either has screen-reader functionality or it doesn’t; captions are either available or they’re not. But digital accessibility exists on a spectrum, and what works for some users won’t work for others. Castor is the only blind person I’ve been able to find who uses the Vision Pro’s screen reader reliably. Most low-vision users — including myself — who use VoiceOver on our phones or computers find it too chaotic and unwieldy on the Vision Pro. Watching Collard use her AVP, I was struck by her expertise — she drew on decades of IT troubleshooting and a bone-deep familiarity with the Apple ecosystem that she leveraged to surmount numerous small obstacles that arose as she demoed her workflow for me. The first time I wore an AVP, I was astonished by how intuitive it was to use — within a minute or two, I was opening and closing and resizing windows, dialing down my surroundings and turning up a Joshua Tree landscape. A college student I met on InSpaze, a spatial chatroom where AVP users hang out, told me that the first time he let his older brother, who has Down syndrome, use his AVP, his brother independently played video games on it for two hours. But this native intuitiveness can fall away the further a disabled person might stray from the typical, mainstream user. I don’t doubt that Castor is able to fluidly use her AVP entirely with audible feedback, but she’s also a lifelong screen-reader user with a B.S. in computer science, not to mention a full-time engineer at Apple. Users with less expertise can struggle to figure it out. It’s also worth noting that within the chronically underemployed and impoverished disabled population, these users represent a rarefied subset who can drop a few thousand dollars — often with professional interest — on this class of first-gen tech toy. Still, my brief experience with the AVP allowed me to imagine a future version where, for instance, the price comes down, Apple opens up the front-facing cameras to developers, and what is already a powerful low-vision device could become the ultimate tool for blind and low-vision people. When I play the complicated tabletop games my son adores, and press a game’s card to my nose to read it, I often find myself wishing I could tap on the blocks of indecipherable text the way I can with a paragraph of text on my iPhone and hear it read aloud. It’s easy to imagine a non-distant future where I could wear a fourth-gen AVP, leveraging whatever comes after GPT4o, and tap one of the game cards with my finger, and hear a readout of the text printed there, along with a description of whatever illustration is on the card, too. If I preferred to use my residual vision, I might casually use two fingers to zoom in on the card (or my son’s face) the way you’d enlarge a photo on your iPhone. Accessibility operates, to use the language of computing, in a stack. In the example above, the game is only accessible if the AI app that’s describing my video feed can be used by a blind person. And as a blind user, I can only access that app if the operating system it’s running on is built with a disabled user in mind. If any of these links in the chain fail, then the whole system crashes. In May, when Sonos, the smart-speaker company, updated its app, its screen-reader accessibility regressed significantly, making the app — which one needs to control the company’s speakers — unusable for its blind users, threatening to turn thousands of dollars’ worth of high-end audio gear into expensive, silent sculptures. Everyone relies on fallible technologies, but disabled users are in an especially precarious position, and this experience of a smoothly functioning stack suddenly imploding with a developer’s capricious update happens constantly, including from companies that have demonstrated a commitment to accessibility in the past. (Sonos has since pledged to make accessibility improvements by mid-June.) In April, an analyst with sources from inside Apple’s supply chain reported that Apple had slashed AVP shipment projections for 2024 after “demand in the U.S. market [had] fallen sharply beyond expectations.” If it doesn’t find a market, and Apple discontinues the AVP, then many disabled users will see their accessibility stacks implode. Maxine Collard’s bedroom in San Francisco is dominated by the double-bass she played in orchestras growing up. “It’s an albino,” she said with a grin, pointing out the unusual blond-wood design, “just like me.” In high school, she tried a tragicomically long list of adaptations to read her music while simultaneously maintaining the proper posture the double-bass requires — she couldn’t lean her face into the music stand the way she could with her computer screen. In the end, she just memorized an astonishing amount of Brahms. Now, wearing her AVP, she can stretch her sheet music to the size of the wall and years of orchestral struggle are erased with a flick of her wrist. I asked about a glowing piece of tech sitting on a table next to the bass. Perched next to a record player, it looked like a device from a 1950s electronics lab but with contemporary manufacturing. “Oh, that’s a big tube amp,” she told me. “With turntables, the whole argument that somehow they sound better is, like, quantitatively not true,” she said. “Vinyl’s not going to do a better job of reproducing audio than digital is. There’s good math that proves it.” She gazed at the amp through the black-mirrored surface of her AVP. “What is true,” she said, “is that the particular way in which it is worse — it’s better. The distortions this amp gives to the sound, they’re actually just way more pleasant-sounding, if you’re a human.” This idea illuminates an important aspect of accessibility: There is a quantitative way of looking at disability, where without hands, or working eyes, you’re mathematically lower on the human number line (priority seven, rather than two or three, in the logic of software development). It seems like common sense that using a keyboard with Sticky Keys, or reading email with a screen reader, or browsing the web with a joystick, should be a second-class experience. But when the tools work, and the signal comes through clearly, whatever minor distortions exist can feel as warm and invisible as surface noise on a vinyl record. At the end of my visit to Apple Park, I sat in the ring building’s central garden with Sarah Herrlinger, who’s advocated for people with disabilities within the company for more than 20 years. When she told me that Apple aims to re-create “surprise and delight” for all its users, including those with disabilities, I brushed the comment aside as more Jobsian marketing copy. But the next day, in Collard’s apartment, watching her demonstrate how she used to play video games (knees pressed against her TV console, nose almost to the 60-inch screen) and how she does now (lying on her bed playing Metroid Prime on a screen the size of her ceiling), I saw her point. The Vision Pro wasn’t giving Collard superpowers, or correcting her vision, or erasing her disability. It just gave her access to the same experience — of efficiency, competence, and pleasure — that most mainstream users accept as a given. Correction: This story has been updated to more accurately describe Dan Golden. "
51,Ed Kilgore,Trump Surrogate Nancy Mace Thwarts McCarthy ‘Revenge Tour’,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/election-results-nancy-mace-thwarts-mccarthy-revenge-tour.html,"Trump-endorsee Nancy Mace, who helped eject Kevin McCarthy from the speakership, easily defeated McCarthy-backed ‘revenge tour’ challenger Catherine Templeton. Election results show it was a good day for primary candidates backed by Trump.",2024-06-12T16:14:19Z,"One of the beloved Beltway narratives of the past few months has been that ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is engaged in a “revenge tour” aimed at utilizing primary challenges to punish the “crazy eight” House Republicans who voted to eject him last October. Stop one on the supposed tour was the coastal South Carolina district of Nancy Mace, an attention-grabbing and sometimes erratic congresswoman who survived a Donald Trump–backed purge effort two years ago over her criticism of his behavior on January 6. She then helped deep-six McCarthy. His efforts to return the favor didn’t work out. After athletic efforts to curry favor with the 45th president, Mace had the MAGA imprimatur this time around, while the vengeful McCarthy lined up support for challenger Catherine Templeton, best known as the union-hating Nikki Haley’s union-bashing state labor department director. Templeton also lost a 2018 gubernatorial primary to Haley’s successor (and Trump friend), Henry McMaster, but did manage to let it be known she supported Trump against Haley prior to this year’s South Carolina presidential primary. Her baggage didn’t deter McCarthy, though, as NBC News reported: McCarthy boosted Templeton’s campaign, spending $10,000 through his political action committee, Majority Committee PAC. Another PAC with ties to McCarthy, the American Prosperity Alliance, contributed $15,000 to South Carolina Patriots PAC, an organization that has spent over $2.1 million to defeat Mace and over $400,000 to support Templeton. Despite the money and Templeton’s rep as a doctrinaire conservative, Mace dispatched her by nearly a two-to-one margin. More important, she did well enough to avoid a runoff despite a third candidate in the race. McCarthy will have other opportunities for revenge (notably next week in Virginia, where he is on the same side as Trump in trying to purge House Freedom Caucus chair Bob Good), but his “tour” is not off to a good start. The Mace-Templeton result highlighted a banner night of primary wins for Trump-backed candidates. In other South Carolina races, Trump’s support almost certainly clinched a close win for scandal-plagued U.S. House incumbent William Timmons, and longtime MAGA stalwart and Black televangelist Mark Burns finished first and is in a GOP runoff for an open seat. In North Dakota, congressman Kelly Armstrong, Trump’s endorsee to succeed VP prospect Doug Burgum as governor, routed Burgum’s own candidate and lieutenant governor, Tammy Miller. In Nevada, a late Trump endorsement helped party Establishment favorite Sam Brown easily win a Senate primary; he will face Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen in November in one of the contests that will determine control of the chamber. There’s one uncalled House race in Nevada, where a Trump-backed candidate is holding on to a narrow lead, and if he wins, the former president will have a clean sweep in the June 11 primaries, as befits his position as the dominant force in the Republican Party. A former House Speaker like Kevin McCarthy really can’t compete. By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us."
52,Jonathan Chait,The Insurrationalizers: J.D. Vance Supports ‘America’s Hitler’,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-insurrationalizers-j-d-vance-backs-americas-hitler.html,"Ohio Senator J.D. Vance explains in an interview with Ross Douthat why Donald Trump’s coup attempt was fine. Vance once called Trump ‘America’s Hitler,’ but now wants to be vice-preisdent.",2024-06-14T13:52:40Z,"[What is this series?] Few political phenomena are more overdetermined than J.D. Vance’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s coup attempt. Vance has carried off a cynical but highly successful mid-career switch from venture capitalist to professional pseudo-populist that requires catering to the beliefs of his constituency; he has fallen in with far-right authoritarian intellectuals who long for the destruction of the republic; and he is angling for a spot on Trump’s ticket. Each of these individually provide Vance with more than enough reason to bless Trump’s attempt to secure an unelected second term. Collectively, they make the decision a no-brainer. But Vance, surprisingly, still possesses a brain, or at least enough pretensions to wish to justify his stance to those who do. And so, in his interview with Ross Douthat, Vance could have simply justified Trump’s attack on democracy by pledging fealty to Trump. Instead, he constructed an elaborate rationale for a man he once described as “America’s Hitler” attempting his own Beer Hall Putsch. Like many Republicans, Vance feels embarrassed by the claims made by Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani that the election was rigged by Dominion Voting Systems and Hugo Chavez. Instead he argues that it was rigged by emergency pandemic measures to expand mail-in voting and media coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop: The argument is basically that there were a host of institutional actors, technology companies, various forms of censorship, that mobilized in 2020 in a way that they hadn’t in 2016. There was tech censorship. People were primed to push back against any October surprises. And look, October surprises are part of American democracy, and whether you think Hunter Biden is as major an issue as I do or disagree, in American democracy you let the voters decide. That was a way in which the basic democratic will of America was obstructed. I don’t see any reason to think that Dominion voting machines switched ballots, but there was a breakdown in democratic will.  Point No. 2 is that the rules of the game were changed in the middle. When does a ballot have to be mailed in Pennsylvania to count under the election rules? That was changed. That was changed for Covid reasons, in a way that partially is the fault of the Republican National Committee — we weren’t prepared for it, Democrats were, and they took advantage of it. None of these complaints comes anywhere close to justifying Trump’s attempt to overturn the election. If voting procedures hadn’t been changed to accommodate a once-in-a-century pandemic, that would have distorted the result even more. And if biased media coverage makes elections illegitimate, then every Republican victory since the founding of Fox News deserves an asterisk. Vance goes on to argue that Trump’s attempt to nullify the election result was fine because it followed constitutional procedures: He was using the constitutional procedures. Now, your argument is that he was using them ineffectively, or maybe even illegitimately, but he was trying to take a constitutional process to its natural conclusion. Suppose it’s true that all this was constitutional. The Constitution, according to Vance, allows a candidate who has clearly and provably lost an election to overturn the result by getting his allies in Congress to accept a series of absurd claims, and then prevail on his own vice-president to join them. If that is true, then the Constitution contains a wormhole that nullifies elections and functionally creates a dictatorship, as long as the president has reliable allies in Congress and the vice-presidency. If the Constitution actually did hand this gun to the president, and the only thing standing between the country and dictatorship was his willingness not to pick it up, then that would make it all the more important to denounce Trump’s efforts to fire it. Instead, Vance just shrugs off Trump’s immoral effort to overturn the election because it followed the rules up until January 6. But this ridiculous argument is all academic anyway, because on January 6, Trump stopped following the rules. Here is where Douthat brings up this rather important flaw in Vance’s case. And here is Vance’s pathetic reply: ​​I think people really, really underrate the sense to which there is palpable and actionable frustration, and I’m always surprised that their assumption appears to be that Trump is the worst, rather than the best, expression of that frustration. Or at least, one of the better in the whole host of possibilities. We’re in this moment where people are really pissed off, and I think for legitimate reasons. And I don’t understand, looking at the country that we have right now, and saying, ‘The riot on January the 6th was the worst expression of this.’ All the lawyerly cleverness dissipates, and Vance is left muttering about how bad things happen and the other side is worse than Trump. There’s no half-serious justification, just tribal grievance. “People are pissed off,” he explains. Well, yes, that happens. People are always pissed off. Humans have constructed various ways of working around this reality. One of them, a constitutional republic with fair elections and robust liberal protections, has worked fairly well. I propose we keep it going, even if Vance has calculated that his continued advancement might require putting it aside.

53,Elie Honig,The Supreme Court’s Make-or-Break Decision on Trump,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-supreme-courts-make-or-break-decision-on-trump.html,"Watch closely because this will be the most important political moment of the summer, writes legal columnist Elie Honig.",2024-06-14T10:00:03Z,"For most of the past year, we’ve wondered, Just how much damage will the four indictments of Donald Trump inflict on him before the 2024 election? After months of war-gaming, we suddenly have newfound clarity. The pre-election fates of three of the Trump cases are now all but settled, and resolution of the fourth will soon give us the single most crucial pivot point of the Trump legal saga and the 2024 election cycle. Let’s take inventory. Manhattan District Attorney: Hush Money/2016 Election. The jury has spoken, and the former president is now a convicted felon. Our next order of business: Will Judge Juan Merchan sentence Trump to prison? Sentencing is set for July 11 — just days before the Republican National Convention — and this one feels like a toss-up. On one hand, the healthy majority of New York defendants convicted of the same crime (falsification of business records in the first degree) receive non-prison sentences. On the other hand, Trump’s case presents obvious aggravating factors: his gag-order violations, his public contempt for the judge and the proceedings, his lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility. Either way, watch for Trump to make a political meal out of it. If the judge does impose a prison sentence, Trump will remind his supporters that “they” are going to put him in a cage (literally, now). If the judge sentences Trump merely to probation, fines, and other non-incarceratory terms, then he’ll gloat and claim it was all a big nothing. Meanwhile, the appeals process will play out, slowly. Given the novel charges — this marks the first time in U.S. history that state prosecutors have charged federal-election-law violations as state crimes or predicates — he’s got a better shot than most defendants have on appeal. But, on balance, Trump is unlikely to get his conviction reversed, especially at the New York State level, where 20 of the 21 mid-level appeals judges and all seven judges on the top court were appointed by Democratic governors. (I know it’s not supposed to matter, but of course it does; would we feel the exact same about Trump’s chances if the ideological stats were reversed and 27 of the 28 appeals judges were Republican appointees?) Trump’s appeals won’t be fully resolved by Election Day 2024, and he almost certainly will be permitted to stay out on bail in the meantime. Polling is inconclusive so far on the electoral impact of the conviction, but the soundest conclusion seems to be that it won’t help Trump and it might hurt him a bit. In an election this close, the margins matter. Fulton County District Attorney: 2020 Election Subversion. This overcharged, overbroad, overhyped showpiece had been circling the drain for months, and now it’s clear: This trial isn’t happening before the election or maybe ever. The Georgia Court of Appeals has begun its review of District Attorney Fani Willis’s potential conflicts of interest and her out-of-court public statements. We don’t know what the appeals court ultimately will do, but we do know (1) it didn’t have to take this case, but it did, and (2) it didn’t have to pause the trial court proceedings, but it did. Neither of those are wonderful signs for the prosecution.  The former federal and state prosecutor breaks down the headlines at the intersection of law and politics.  If Willis is disqualified, her entire office goes with her, and this case languishes in purgatory as it awaits review by an independent prosecutorial board, followed either by dismissal or reassignment to another county. This would be an undeserved windfall for Trump and his co-defendants. But when an enormously powerful elected district attorney gives testimony that (according to the trial judge) raises “reasonable questions” about whether she “testified untruthfully” and makes “legally improper” public statements that could prejudice the defendants, consequences follow. DOJ Special Counsel: Mar-a-Lago Classified Documents. The fury around Judge Aileen Cannon – calls for her impeachment or removal (a remedy that Jack Smith himself has not sought), fantastical imputations of corruption — is a bit overwrought. But she certainly has not been a paragon of judicial brilliance or efficiency. Nor does Judge Cannon seem to give a darn about trying Trump before the election. Indeed, recent news that the judge has postponed several pending pretrial motions confirms what has been clear all along: This one isn’t happening before the election. Moving along. DOJ Special Counsel: 2020 Election Subversion. The most important of the four Trump criminal cases also faces the most uncertain immediate future. Someday soon — within the next couple weeks, before the end of the Supreme Court’s term — we’ll learn its fate. The Court will decide, for the first time in American history, whether a president (or any federal official) can enjoy criminal immunity for his official acts. Watch closely, because this will be the pivotal moment of the summer. Broadly speaking, the Court’s decision could go either of two ways for Trump, leading to vastly divergent legal and political outcomes. Consider the possibilities: Scenario A. The Supreme Court accepts Trump’s immunity claim on the spot (highly unlikely) or sends the matter back to the trial court for a fact-finding hearing about whether his conduct falls within some newly articulated standard for immunity (not at all unlikely). Those additional proceedings, and the attendant appeals, blow out the rest of the remaining calendar between now and November, and the trial happens after the 2024 election (or, if Trump wins, in 2029). Scenario B. The Supreme Court outright rejects Trump’s immunity claim — perhaps by refusing to recognize criminal immunity at all or by creating some form of immunity test but finding that Trump falls outside those parameters. The case would then go back to the district court, where both Jack Smith and Judge Tanya Chutkan are hell-bent on trying Trump before the election. The judge would likely set a trial date in August or September, carrying through mid- to late October. In this scenario, Trump would be pulled off the campaign trail and relegated to the defendant’s table inside a D.C. courtroom for virtually the entire 2024 election stretch run. And a verdict — likely guilty, given the evidence and the venue — could drop just before Election Day. Indeed, the differences are that stark: Either the case gets the boot and is mostly forgotten until after the election or it lands smack-dab in the middle of the campaign homestretch and culminates days before Americans cast their votes. There’s no middle ground. Over just the past few weeks, we’ve gone from a morass of four unknowns to three mostly knowns and one still unknown with monster consequences. More than any other outstanding contingency — Trump’s vice-presidential selection, the candidates’ debate performances, trends in inflation — the Supreme Court’s ruling on immunity will define, and perhaps determine, the 2024 election. Trump’s criminal fate, and his political fortunes, hang in the balance. This article originally appeared in the free CAFE Brief newsletter.
