12,BBC Bitesize,Sound like a Euro 2024 expert with this German football jargon,https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zbhk6rd,BBC Bitesize investigates the history behind Germany's unique football vernacular with historian Christoph Marx. Examples include the first German football game and phrases to look out for during the Euros.,2024-06-07T14:33:40Z,"Part of Bitesize Topical The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship (also known as Euro 2024) is stirring up football fever all over the world. This year the championship will be staged by three-time Euro winners Germany and will take place from 14 June to 14 July across ten venues. But did you know that Germany has a unique football vernacular, with a fascinating history behind it? BBC Bitesize interviewed World Cup historian Christoph Marx to ask how the language of the game has changed as its popularity in Germany grew. From Gurkenspiele to the lucky Fußballgott, here’s our guide to the history of German football phrases that will help you sound like a local as you catch the game. This video can not be played Christoph Marx is a historian who specialises in football jargon Kim: A game of two halves, missed a sitter, clean sheet, nutmeg, dink. Words and phrases football fans up and down the country are more than a little familiar with. But it’s not just UK supporters of the game that have got their own lingo going on. Here in Germany, they give us Brits a run for our money when it comes to footballing words and phrases. So I’ve come to meet a German football language expert here in Berlin, to find out more. K: Hi I’m Kimberley, nice to meet you. Christoph: Hello, Christoph Marx, hello, hello. K: So Christoph, we know now that Germans love football just as much as people in the UK, but that wasn’t always the case was it? C: No, it was not always the case. In the beginning, especially the establishment in Germany, don’t like the game. Because they see it as a very emotional game, that was not typical German. K: Am I right in thinking that Germany really wanted to distance itself from England when it came to footballing phrases? C: As a way to make this “English” game to a German way was the method of language. To replace every English original phrase to a German one. One German teacher, Konrad Koch, from Braunschweig had made it his task to replace every phrase. K: And when I was researching for this interview Christoph, I came across the word “Bananenflanke” which is obviously to curl the ball in German, I hope I got the pronunciation right. C: It’s like the curve of a banana. K: Yeah, yeah and we’ve got a similar phrase in the UK. A lot of words and phrases seem to come from animals and from fruit. C: We have our “Gurkenspiel” – “cucumber game”, it’s a game of very poor quality. And there’s another word “Fliegenfänger” – “catcher of the flies”, if a goalkeeper defends very badly and a lot of goals were scored. One other really nice phrase is “Kopfballungeheuer”, it’s a monster of the header, to score a goal. Harry Kane is always a Kopfballungeheuer. K: Now, in the next few weeks there is going to be an influx of England and Scotland fans coming over here to Germany ahead of the Euros. Could you teach me one key phrase that we all need to know? C: There’s a phrase of the phrase, it’s the one phrase you can use nearly in every context and that’s “Das ist Fußball” – That is football. If you win, if you lose, if the game is beautiful, if it’s ugly. “That is football”, it’s a phrase that works everywhere. And perhaps for English it’s interesting, “Elfmeterschießen” – Penalty Shootout. K: Don’t bring them up Christoph! C:Penalty killer! Penalty killer! It’s very interesting, I think you will be in touch with this. K: We live in hope, but either way das ist Fußball! C: Ja, das ist Fußball, genau! You win, and sometimes you lose. K: Finally Christoph, I could not let you go without asking you as a historian specialising in football jargon, what your favourite words and phrases are in German? C: One of the phrases I like most is “Fußballgott” (Football God). You can hope we are lucky to win and we hope for the Fußballgott to be on our side. K: Well Christoph, it has been lovely chatting to you but I do hope the Fußballgott is not with you this time and it’s with England and Scotland, the Home Nations. C: Yes! We will see, we will see! K: We’ll see! Nowadays, it’s safe to say Germany is as keen on the game as the UK is - but that wasn’t always the case. Football as we know it evolved from Victorian boys’ school games, and the official rules were published in 1863 with the formation of the English Football Association. It grew in popularity all over the world, but it wasn’t well-known with the German people, or particularly well-liked. “Football became slowly popular [in Germany] in the first half of the 20th Century, in times where new mass media like radio were invented and brought the game to bigger parts of the society,” says Christoph. Before this, football was considered an ‘ugly’ sport by the establishment, or KaiserreichcloseKaiserreichGerman state ruled by an emperor (der Kaiser), also the official name of the German Empire.. In contrast, gymnastics was an example of a ‘German sport’, with flowing movements that embodied ideals such as discipline, order and Körperbeherrschung (body control). “Against this, football was seen as emotional, anarchic and non-calculated, not really controllable – and so ‘dangerous’ for the establishment. ""To be accepted by the establishment, it must be made into a German game through the language.” In 1874, German secondary school teacher and football pioneer Konrad Koch from Braunschweig organised the first football game in Germany. He made it his mission to translate footie terms to sound uniquely German, and in 1903, printed his own German football ‘rulebook’ documenting them. For example, games were overseen by a Spielkaiser (emperor of the game), who acted as team captain and referee. Rather than use passen (to pass), Koch taught his students ‘to give up’ the ball (aufgaben). This might seem very specific, but it was important to ‘Germanise’ the game for it to be accepted. However, this wasn’t the case in all German-speaking countries: “Only in Germany there was such language purism,” says Christoph. “Not in Austria or Switzerland where there are today still some English phrases in the domestic language.” For example, Austria uses Goalie, Corner and Assist, where Germany uses Der Torwart (or Torhüter), Ecke and Abgane respectively. “Language is a vivid organism and is developing further and further,” says Christoph. “Media, especially journalism and of course social media - but also fans are creating always new phrases. If one invented phrase is often repeated in media and fans, a phrase will live on and be integrated into the football vocabulary.” The football language in Germany is becoming more international, especially due to factors such as managers in the Bundesliga (German football league) coming from elsewhere in Europe. “Because of the many international players and trainers who play football in Germany and speak often only broken German there are new neologismscloseNeologismsA newly-coined word or phrase, often accepted into mainstream language. - mixture words from German and mostly English. An example is ‘The no-look-pass’.” Learn some essential German football jargon: Der Tor - GoalAbseits - OffsideEine gelbe/rote Karte - Yellow/red cardEr/sie hat den Ball - He/she has the ballDas war knapp! - That was close!Einwechslung - SubstitutionUm ein Haar! - By a hair!Verlängerung - Extra timeFreistoß - Free kickAnstoß - Kick-off “Quite a lot of German phrases are from the fruit and animals,” Christoph laughs. “A lion is a symbol of the wildness of the game, so we might say ‘fight like a lion’, be strong.” The German term Bananenflanke means to curve the ball (referring to the shape of a banana), similar to ‘bending the ball’ in English. A Gurkenspiel (cucumber game) is a poorly-played game on both sides, and a Fliegenfänger (fly catcher) is a goalkeeper who fumbles - like the English term ‘butterfingers’. Christoph also recommends the phrase “Das ist Fußball” (That’s football) which is applicable for nearly every situation when you want to say something is typical football. “If you win, if you lose, if the game is beautiful, it’s ugly, etc - ‘Das ist Fußball’ is a phrase that works everywhere.” In English, the colloquial equivalent might be ‘Classic footie!’. “One of the phrases I like most in German is Fußballgott (Football god) because it is the irony phrase,” says Christoph. “A shot only millimetres left or right of the goal post could decide if you lose or win.” So, if your favourite team scores an unbelievable winning goal, you can say, “Der Fußballgott war auf unser Seite”: A typical phrase meaning luck was on our side, and the player who scored is your Fußballgott. “But watching the game, everyone is equal… from every country, no matter what language you speak.” Improve your German on home turf with BBC Bitesize.

14,BBC Bitesize,Euro 2024: The exhibition showing how football 'is for everyone',https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zsndh4j,"Berlin's Olympiastadion Museum display tackles racism, homophobia, sexism and ableism in the sport as Germany prepares to welcome the tournament.",2024-06-10T13:24:15Z,"Part of Bitesize Topical This summer will see the football world unite once more for Euro 2024. The tournament is set to bring together 24 nations, across 10 host cities, for a fabulous football extravaganza. While the world of football continues to take strides to ensure the beautiful game can be enjoyed by everyone, this was not always the case – as has been highlighted by a brand new exhibition in Berlin’s Olympiastadion Sports Museum. Julian Rieck is project manager at What Matters, the organisation behind the exhibition and he told BBC Bitesize a little more about it. This video can not be played The exhibition – named ‘Sport. Crowds. Power.’ – focuses on football during the Nazi dictatorship of Germany, which lasted from 1933 to 1945, but as Julian was keen to stress, the exhibition’s focus does not stop at 1945. The exhibition also shows what he described as: ""the continuities in the personal, but also in the ideology, of this 12-year Nazi time that shaped Germany.” One focus of the exhibition, which Julian described as his favourite, is a collection of football shirts from teams that were forbidden or exiled during the Nazi dictatorship. One such club, Bar Kochba Frankfurt, was home to more than 1,000 members at one point – before the Nazis dissolved all Jewish organisations and clubs in 1938. Julian said the collection: “gives a connection to today and that people are still today excluded,” highlighting a key theme of the exhibition in that discrimination and exclusion are not merely things of the past. Julian made a point of saying that stadiums are not necessarily safe spaces for minorities or oppressed groups, citing the lingering presence of racism, homophobia, sexism, antisemitism and ableism in modern football. One example he gives of a safe space is the Pride House Berlin - specially set up for queer fans to watch Euro games, away from the stadiums where they may still face discrimination. When asked how he thought Germans today may feel about the Olympiastadion, Julian replied, “People don’t know that the stadium is the same stadium [as] during Hitler times.” Julian mentioned one family who had visited the exhibition, following a football tournament, who had expressed shock that the stadium was the same one that was used during the Nazi’s reign. When reflecting on what he’d like to achieve with the exhibition, Julian referenced his own youth. “I remember my childhood,"" he said. ""And how much football gave me and shaped my identity and I thought, OK, this is really what we’re looking for, that young kids have this memory and that they feel this connection to the exhibition and the present.” And what about his hopes for the exhibition? Julian explained how one had already come true. He cited the words written by a young boy in the exhibition's guestbook as evidence that what was on display was not just about reflecting on the past, but looking towards our future. Those words? ""Football is for everybody."" This article was published in June 2024 Seven standout moments from Euros history When was the first Euros game played? Who scored the fastest goal?

Lib Dem leader Ed Davey unveiled his party's manifesto ahead of the general election on 4 July. It pledges to boost spending on health and social care in England by more than £9bn by 2028, with Davey saying money would come from increasing tax on big banks, water companies and fossil fuel firms.  Meanwhile, Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservatives leader, revealed that he'll stand down from the role after the election - and resign as an MSP if he's re-elected to Westminster. It follows a row over him standing as a candidate for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East instead of David Duguid, who has been in hospital and was in effect de-selected.  And we heard from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak when he sat down with Nick Robinson, kicking off a series of interviews that the BBC's doing in the run up to polling day. Among other things, he acknowledged that owning a home had become harder under the Conservatives - but said he wanted ""to make sure it's easier"".  He also said his party's manifesto - being published tomorrow - would contain further tax cuts and repeated an apology following backlash after he prematurely left D-Day commemoration events in Normandy last week.

Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the most significant philosophers of the twentieth century, Philippa Foot (1920 - 2010). Her central question was, “Why be moral?” Drawing on Aristotle and Aquinas, Foot spent her life working through her instinct that there was something lacking in the prevailing philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s which held that values could only be subjective. Could there really be no objective response to the horrors of the concentration camps that she had seen on newsreels, no way of saying that such acts were morally wrong? Foot developed an ethics based on virtues, in which humans needed virtues to flourish as surely as plants needed light and water. While working through her ideas she explored applied ethics and the difference between doing something and letting it happen, an idea she illustrated with what became The Trolley Problem.

Spokesperson James Elder described harrowing scenes in an interview with Radio 4 Today programme's Mishal Husain.  He said that on his latest visit he has encountered people who 'just want this over', even if it means being killed in an air strike. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel's offensive following the 7 October attacks, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 people taken hostage.

Zubeida Malik asks can be done to make the Hajj greener. The Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the Hajj, attracted no fewer than two million pilgrims in 2023. But this pilgrim boom has an environmental downside: climate scientists are warning that the five-day Hajj alone, with its bargain flights, hotels, catering and local transport, produces over 1.8 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, roughly the amount New York City emits every two weeks. Yet the Saudi government has plans to go much bigger still: by 2030, they want 30 million pilgrims a year to take part in the Hajj and Umrah. Zubeida Malik asks what the Saudi authorities, local groups and campaigners, religious scholars and the pilgrims themselves can do to reduce the environmental footprint of one of the largest religious gatherings on the planet.

The election of Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum is a moment of history. For the first time, a woman is in charge of the country. Host James Reynolds travels around the country hearing about the challenges facing the new president through the lives and concerns and hopes of the people he spoke to. Many live in fear of criminal cartels and armed gangs, and women feel unsafe on the streets. Ricardo, whose brother was abducted and sister was murdered, is afraid to go out with his daughters. In a migration camp in Tijuana, a couple with two young daughters describe how they left their hometown after receiving death threats from a cartel and Ana, who wants to be a doctor, hopes a woman in power will make a difference.

He wrongly claims that climate change is a “scam” or a “hoax” designed to hold Africa back. On social media, he has also become known as a staunch defender of fossil fuel exploration in Africa. His views have caught the eye of those in the West who, like him, deny the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming. They have helped him grow his following and spread his message globally. But, in doing so, has Mr Machogu unwittingly become a tool for the fossil fuel industry?

For the hundreds of people who live in a cluster of villages between India and Pakistan, a map drawn up long ago still causes daily struggles. Punjab - the land of the five rivers - was carved up to create Pakistan during The Partition of 1947 when India gained its independence from colonial rule. Two rivers went to Pakistan, two stayed with India and one, the Ravi, crosses both countries. For 72 years, communities who live by the Ravi on the Indian side have been asking for a permanent bridge, so they can access hospitals, schools, shops, banks. What they have got is a makeshift pontoon bridge, which has to be dismantled for the monsoon season. Journalist Chhavi Sachdev travels to the western part of India to meet the Indian people whose lives are shaped by the Ravi river.

That’s why these young Nigerians created a community for others like them. 'Spiritual but not religious’ is the fastest growing faith category amongst Gen Z and Millennials around the world. However, in Nigeria, where most people identify as either Christian or Muslim, questioning doctrine or exploring alternative beliefs is still often seen as taboo. Kamsy and Ore were both raised in evangelical Christian households, but began questioning their faith in their early 20s. Separately, they began reading about other belief systems, such as Judaism, Buddhism and traditional African religions, and posting their thoughts and experiences on social media. Neither were prepared for the backlash they received. When the two of them finally connected, they bonded over how lonely their ‘deconstruction’ journeys had been. So they created a WhatsApp group for others like them. Today, The Table defines itself as a community for the irreligious yet spiritual, and aims to provide a space for connection and discussion free from the dogma.

Concerned by pupils' anxiety levels, they asked parents to delay buying their children smartphones. Greystones made global headlines a year ago when, concerned by rising anxiety levels among their pupils, the headteachers from all the primary schools in the town invited parents to sign a voluntary pact or code; not to buy their child a smartphone before they moved up to secondary school. In Ireland that’s usually at age 12. Beth McLeod talks to teachers, pupils and parents about their reaction to the initiative. Has there been any backlash? At one of the town’s secondary schools she meets an assistant headteacher who is passionately demanding a culture change around phone use for older students too, warning parents that although they think they are giving their children access to the internet, they are really giving the internet access to their children. She speaks to teenagers about their views on what is the right age to be on social media and asks the Irish Health Minister what the government is doing to hold tech companies to account.

town of Coulommiers, 40 miles outside of Paris, we meet Noémie Del Mastro, a worker at an elderly care home. What the 31-year-old mother of three tells us is the sort of thing that
may well keep President Macron up at night for the next month of the election
campaign.  ""They say the far right scare people,"" she says. ""But maybe we should try that
because nothing else is working and France is getting worse."" ""I’m scared to leave the house, use public transport,"" she continues. She says immigration and housing are crucial issues where President
Macron has failed and where the far right offers solutions. ""Too many immigrants are coming into the country without
contributing anything,"" she says.  Noémie says reports on TV and online have contributed to her concerns. ""My vote is linked to my children and their future because I’m scared
for their future."""
