0,Ally Wybrew,5 of the best experiences in Niagara Parks,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-5-experiences-niagara-parks,"Come for the falls, stay for the endless natural beauty, dramatic industrial architecture and colourful wildlife encounters.",2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Come for the falls, stay for the endless natural beauty, dramatic industrial architecture and colourful wildlife encounters. Straddling the divide between the Canadian province of Ontario on the western bank of the Niagara River and the US state of New York to the east, Niagara Falls is a destination that needs little introduction. The thundering Horseshoe Falls — the largest of the three linked waterfalls — is undeniably the star attraction, with the waters of the Niagara River plummeting over a 188ft-high drop before exploding in clouds of billowing mist. It’s a scene that mesmerises millions of visitors every year, and while this immense natural phenomenon is indeed breathtaking, it’s by no means the only reason to visit the region. Explore further into Ontario’s Niagara Parks and you’ll find extensive natural beauty and a fascinating industrial history. Here are five of the best experiences not to miss on your next visit. Best for: the geographerNiagara Falls may have been pulling in eager-eyed tourists for years, but basking in their majesty the way you can today has not always been possible. Originally known as the ‘Sheet of Falling Water’, Journey Behind the Falls is an attraction at the western lip of Horseshoe Falls, documenting the geographical evolution of Niagara’s cascades, which have receded seven miles in 12,500 years. It also tells the history of Niagara Falls as an area, from its first Indigenous inhabitants to its position as a world-famous tourist attraction. In addition to getting the best spray-soaked views, visitors can follow the site’s progress first-hand — from the rickety wooden staircases built in the early 1800s and the first tunnels cut into the rock in the early 1900s, all the way through to today’s extensive viewing platforms, walkways, exhibitions and immersive experiences. Best for: the outdoor enthusiast Finding peace and quiet alongside racing rapids might seem impossible, but down on the banks of the Niagara River there’s a roar that blocks out all else. The power of nature becomes almost meditative when taking a turn along White Water Walk, a quarter-mile stretch of boardwalk at the edge of the frothing white-and-turquoise waters. From River Road, a lift descends 230ft to this riverside walkway, which juts out regularly into platforms to allow optimal viewing of the mighty rapids and the 410-million-year-old rock layers they traverse. Information plaques educate visitors on the geology of the gorge — from its 11,000-year-old Ice Age formation to its dolomite and shale-based rock bed — and give detail on the flora and fauna found in the surrounding park. Best for: the thrill-seekerThe power of the Niagara River can be felt far from the cascading tumult of Horseshoe Falls. Over three miles north, visitors will find Niagara Glen, a 125ft-deep pocket that was carved out of the river’s ancient banks around 5,000 years ago. Here, a surging whirlpool of water rages, created by an abrupt anticlockwise turn at the rapids’ end that results in a constant maelstrom of conflicting currents. For the best view, take the Whirlpool Aero Car, an antique but recently refurbished cable car that has been transporting visitors across the gorge for over a century. With capacity for up to 35 people, it soars 200ft above the Class 6 rapids for just over half a mile on a round trip, crossing the sharply angled border with the US four times in mid-air (no, you won’t need your passport). It’s a popular attraction, so consider visiting first thing in the morning to avoid queues. Best for: the nature loverJust a ten-minute drive from the Whirlpool Aero Car you’ll find the Niagara Parks Butterfly Conservatory — one of North America’s largest butterfly conservatories. Its lush interior invites visitors to walk 600ft of pathways lined with tropical plants, with more than 2,000 butterflies fluttering under the glass roof. A self-guided tour lets visitors observe butterfly species from all over the world, such as the blue morpho, Low’s swallowtail, red lacewing and small postman, as they flit between trickling waterfalls and towering foliage. See them up close at strategically placed feeding stations, or if you’re lucky, witness newborns take their first flight after emerging from their pupa. Broaden your butterfly knowledge with interactive displays and video presentations, which show short films on the creatures’ life cycle. Best for: the historian Feeling adventurous? Leave the surface behind and board a glass-walled lift to descend into the depths of the Niagara Parks Power Station, a former hydropower plant, built in 1905. As well as wandering the building’s soaring turbine halls where exhibits, artefacts and installations recall its history, guests can walk through the curved confines of its enormous spent-water outlet tunnel. The 2,200ft-long arched corridor transfers visitors from the depths of the plant to a dramatic exit point over the Niagara River, where a new viewing platform reveals the remarkable vistas of Horseshoe Falls, American Falls and the lower Niagara River. Created using only pickaxes, shovels and rudimentary dynamite, this passageway is just one part of an impressive architectural feature, all of which can be accessed for no extra fee (tunnel entry is included with regular admission to the power station site).

1,"Sam Kemp,Tanveer Badal","A guide to Scottsdale, Arizona's desert gateway",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/scottsdale-arizona-desert-gateway-guide,"A young-at-heart city with ancient roots, this Arizona enclave provides the ideal gateway into the desert from which it was born.",2024-06-09T00:00:00Z,"A young-at-heart city with ancient roots, this Arizona enclave provides the ideal gateway into the desert from which it was born. At first glance, you’d be forgiven for mistaking Scottsdale for a city without depth. Here, in the primordial expanse of the Sonoran Desert in southwestern Arizona, first impressions are of a town adorned with all the hallmarks of generic modernity: luxury spas, high-end fashion outlets, sprinkler-fed golf courses. But you’ll find that Scottsdale’s history stretches further than its immaculate surface implies — further even than the history of the United States. Long before it became known as a haven for the rich and famous — before the first guest ranches sprang up in the 1890s, and the city’s first settlers planted their orchards in the red earth — this land played host to Pueblo Ultimo, one of a string of ancient Indigenous settlements that thrived along the Salt and Gila rivers. It was the home of the Hohokam, or ‘those who have disappeared’, a long-vanished people who irrigated the desert with canals, bringing life to the dust before abandoning such villages in the 14th and 15th centuries. They may be gone, but their reverence for the desert landscape has been taken up by the artists enamoured with Scottsdale’s big skies, and architects who, in the oblivion of the surrounding desert, envisioned new ways of living in harmony with nature. Today, you’ll find a city embracing its past as it steps into the future. It’s the kind of place where driverless cars hum outside restaurants highlighting indigenous ingredients cultivated in the same way for millennia, and granite peaks ripe for hiking lie a short hop from cryogenics labs where the hopeful await revival. And then there’s the wine scene — a vestige of the homesteaders and botanists who dared to imagine vineyards creeping across Arizona’s undulating scrublands. You can experience the produce of those sun-baked vines in the tasting rooms dotted around Old Town Scottsdale, a place so compact it’s possible to explore an artists’ studio and sit down for a bottle of Petite Sirah in the time it takes for the sky to shift from pink to pure indigo. And a little further out, beyond the bars and galleries of the centre, satellite neighbourhoods dissolve into open desert. Here, you’ll find architectural oddities carved into the mountains, working ranches operated by real-life cowboys and urban preserves studded with boulders formed many aeons ago. How’s that for depth? Historic Old Town Much like those interred in Scottsdale’s cryogenics facility, the city’s historic square mile remains frozen in time. Bring it to life on a self-guided walking tour taking in saloons, treasured establishments like Cavalliere’s Blacksmith Shop and public art monuments such as sculptor Louise Nevelson’s Windows to the West, which casts its labyrinthine shadow onto the botanical garden outside the Civic Center. Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art Celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2024, this gallery in Scottsdale’s studio-studded Arts District lays claim to one of LA sculptor James Turrell’s Skyspaces — immersive, site-specific installations designed to reconfigure the viewer’s perception of light and space. Step into the ceramic belly of Knight Rise and watch the powder-blue sky subtly shift in colour from the elliptical opening in the ceiling. The Old Adobe Mission The oldest church in Scottsdale is a pearlescent space built by the city’s original Hispanic population, who, along with the Yaqui Indigenous community, created its 14,000 adobe bricks by hand around the time of the Great Depression. It opened its doors in 1933 and today stands as one of just three remaining adobe structures in downtown Scottsdale. Taliesin West Half an hour from downtown Scottsdale, this UNESCO-listed desert enclave was the winter home of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who lived and worked here from 1937 until his death in 1959, instilling in his apprentices the importance of working in harmony with the natural landscape. Experience Wright’s ‘organic architecture’ on a guided tour, wandering among low-slung buildings encased in desert stone while keeping an eye out for hummingbirds. Arizona Cowboy College Bound by the expanse of Tonto National Forest, this working ranch and riding school up beyond North Scottsdale sees horse-whisperers Lori Bridwell and Rocco Wachman offering rigorous courses on horsemanship alongside guided four-legged excursions into the wilds of the Sonoran Desert. Nervous about getting into the saddle? Don’t worry — Rocco has horses he’d “happily let the Pope ride”. REI Join guide Tim Trissler on a half-day guided bike tour of North America’s largest urban preserve, the 3,500-acre McDowell Sonoran, where cholla cacti sizzle alongside surreal rock formations. Tim has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the plants and animals that call this land home, from saguaro-straddling cactus wrens to regal horned lizards. Native Art Market Opened in 2018, this Indigenous-owned and -operated market and performance space in Scottsdale’s Arts District showcases the craftsmanship of some 200 Indigenous artists. Inside, stands stacked with tea, ceramics and turquoise jewellery surround a stage where the likes of Grammy Award-winning Native American flautist Cody Blackbird give regular in-store performances. J Klein Gallery The Sonoran Desert has long provided artists with a canvas to hone their craft. The spirit of the creative community that flourished here in the 1930s and ‘40s lives on in this gallery and working studio in Old Town Scottsdale, where founder Jim Klein’s abstract landscapes share the floor with a Steinway piano often played by local composer Ian Jamison. Cosanti Originals This bell foundry and craft shop in Paradise Valley was once the home of Taliesin West student Paolo Soleri. Today, visitors come to marvel at the Italian architect’s transgressive, ‘earth-cast’ structures, losing themselves in the gentle music produced by the bronze wind bells strung from sun-baked alcoves. The Stand From a portly hut crafted from cactus, Mike Washington and his niece serve made-to-order chilli tacos wrapped in deliciously spongy frybread — a deep-fried dough thought to have originated as a by-product of the ‘Long Walk’ that saw the Navajo forced off their land and into reserves by the US government in the 1860s. FNB Showcasing locally sourced, often indigenous ingredients such as the tepary bean, the ever-changing menu at this James Beard Award-winning restaurant in Scottsdale’s Arts District could feature anything from Peruvian spring rolls to Persian chicken served with grapes plucked from local vines. To drink? Try the NY sour, topped with a vermouth float. The Mission Tucked behind the Old Adobe Mission and slung with crystal chandeliers, this modern Latin restaurant serves meticulously crafted dishes inspired by Scottsdale’s Hispanic roots. Soak up the sultry ambiance over a punchy margarita at the marbled bar before sitting down for tableside guacamole, chorizo-stuffed porchetta and short rib tacos bursting with zingy purple cabbage. The Rusty Spur The doors of this Scottsdale institution first swung open in 1951. Having a drink bathed in the bar’s neon glow remains a rite of passage for out-of-towners, so grab a stool under the wagon wheel chandelier and enjoy a prickly pear cocktail to the dulcet tones of Stetson-clad singer-songwriters from across the state. Goldwater Tap Room This intimate taproom offers a good taste of Scottsdale’s creative craft beer scene. The bar faces two enormous stainless-steel kegs, where 14 Goldwater beers are served fresh off the tap. Drop by for a pint of Desert Rose, a German-style Kölsch made with cactus fruits. Scottsdale Wine Trail Scottsdale’s wine scene is booming, with vineyard owners from Willcox, the Verde Valley and other Arizonian wine-growing regions setting up shop in the city. Among them is rock musician James Maynard Keenan, whose tasting room Merkin pairs artfully curated flights with a heavy metal soundtrack. For a more traditional tasting experience, seek out LDV Wine Gallery or head down to newly opened Los Milics Vineyards’ tasting room, the passion project of Pavle Milic, co-owner of FnB restaurant. Sonder the Monarch This laid-back residence in the heart of downtown Scottsdale overflows with bougainvillea, with a soundtrack of chirping quails. Behind the cream-and-yellow facade, refined doubles are illuminated by floor-to-ceiling windows, while family suites sport dining areas, sofas and private outdoor spaces overlooking the property’s sun-dappled pool. Hotel Valley Ho Famed for hosting the likes of Marilyn Monroe and Carey Grant, this mid-century hotel invites visitors to soak up the glamour of its 1950s heyday. Awash with jazz, the sleek lobby and cocktail lounge lead to extravagant rooms with snowdrop lamps and teal chaise longues. And with grilled oysters on the restaurant menu, you’ll dine in style, too. Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale Perched beneath Pinnacle Peak and surrounded by aromatic desert flora, the one- and two-storey casitas that make up this four-star resort form an intricate adobe village a lizard’s scuttle from the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. Splash out on a premier casita, complete with bedside fireplace, ideal after a night stargazing with resident astronomer Mark Johnston. Don’t miss the fountain-fringed spa, where the gel of the nopal cactus makes for a relaxing massage. Cool your boots At the height of summer, many Scottsdale residents leave the city to spend the day by the Lower Salt River. Head out on a guided kayaking tour with REI and follow the gentle current past wild horses with their muzzles in the water, winding up beneath the rusted bulk of Red Mountain. Sugar Bowl This downtown ice-cream parlour has hardly changed since it first opened its pink-and-white-striped doors in 1958. It’s served as a hangout for everyone from former Scottsdale resident Steven Spielberg to artist and illustrator Bill Keane, whose comic strips still adorn the walls above heart-shaped tables quivering under the weight of the gargantuan fudge sundaes. Soleri sunset Linking the downtown area with Scottsdale waterfront, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza also functions as a calender, marking solar events with a beam produced by sunlight hitting the 6-inch gap between its pylons. Gaze through the gap two weeks shy of the winter solstice and you’ll see the red line that directs footfall across the bridge illuminated by a golden ray. A perfect union of sun and symmetry.

2,Angela Locatelli,Meet the Himalayan trekking guide reclaiming the mountains for women,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/sumitra-acharya-himalayan-trekking-guide-reclaiming-mountains-for-women,The Himalayan trekking leader is part of a new generation of Nepalese women claiming their space amid some of the world’s highest peaks.,2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"The Himalayan trekking leader is part of a new generation of Nepalese women claiming their space amid some of the world’s highest peaks. When 27-year-old Sumitra Acharya took on a job as a trekking porter in 2019, she had a mountain to climb. With Nepal’s outdoor industry a male-dominated field, she defied societal expectations, carrying 15kg loads of clothing, supplies, sleeping bags and more for some 10 miles a day to ease the burden for visiting mountaineers. Five years on, she’s leading expeditions to Everest Base Camp and Annapurna — and, she hopes, inspiring other Nepalese women to reach for new heights. The willingness is there, but it’s not easy out in the field. Guides are on the job for long stretches of time, and for long days, mostly in male groups. The traditional view in our society is still that women need to be near the house, do chores. The outdoors isn’t thought to be for them — not yet. I decided to work in the tourism industry, and I saw tour operator Intrepid was looking for female porters. I instantly said no; at the time, I’d even complain about having to carry bags home from my local market. But when I told my mother, her first reaction was, “If it’s not for you, you can always come back home — but at least give it a try.” So, I did. My parents and brothers supported me, but other relatives and friends told me I was making a mistake. And while there were other female porters and guides at Intrepid, I saw no local women on the trails. I was discouraged by male porters I’d meet at base camps or checkpoints. They’d see me and snort. They told me I was beautiful, that I should get married and enjoy my husband’s money. Some would stare at me like I was an alien, around hotel corners or sitting in dining halls. The people I was working with had my back. They taught me everything, from controlling my pace while hiking to befriending hotel owners so I wouldn’t get homesick. As we say, when there are 1,000 shackles binding you, there’s always one thing that can set you free. The number of female porters, assistant guides and leaders at Intrepid keeps growing. There were a few when I joined; this year, at Intrepid, we’re 37 and counting. I have a few close friends who are passionate about the outdoors, be it climbing or trekking. Their families don’t believe they should pursue it as a career, but they’re taking a stand for themselves. I think that’s the major difference now. Girls are getting an education and want to be independent. I always wanted to do solo backpacking trips, but I didn’t do any exploring until I was 20. I was born in a rural community in Sindhupalchok district, northeast of Kathmandu, but raised in a city in the Kathmandu Valley. There are no transport links to my home village; whenever I visited, I struggled to walk the hour and a half it took to get there, so I thought I wasn’t made to climb mountains. Then, while studying agriculture in Jiri town, I went on a hike to nearby Cherdung Hill, which reaches 12,000ft. It proved to me that this was something I could do. Besides Everest, another popular trekking area in the Himalayas is Manaslu — the eighth-highest mountain in the world at 26,781ft. You can still find a proper sense of rawness there, in the local culture and traditions. As for new hikes I’d like to do myself, it would be the country’s far west. There are a number of destinations, but my pick would be Upper Dolpo. If one single girl is inspired by my story, that’d be it. But equally, I’m proud to be here, talking about my life and how it’s changed in just five years. I’m doing my dream job, showing my country to people from around the world. I feel like a leader. Intrepid runs a number of small-group trips to Nepal. Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"
3,Ben Clatworthy,Why the student gap year is more popular than ever,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/student-gap-year-volunteering-conservation,"From enhancing a CV to benefitting a local community or travelling with purpose, the motives for students to take a gap year are increasingly nuanced.",2024-06-08T00:00:00Z,"From enhancing a CV to benefitting a local community or travelling with purpose, the motives for students to take a gap year are increasingly nuanced. For decades, the gap year recipe remained virtually unchanged: cheap hostels, all-night parties, banana pancakes and months spent ‘finding yourself’. Throw in some bungee jumping, quad biking and moped riding, along with days doing not very much, and you quickly paint the stereotypical picture of the fabled ‘year out’ of old. The gap year travellers of today, though, are far more likely to be found doing  sunrise yoga on a beach before a day of volunteering. Evenings are less about getting blind drunk and more about  sitting around a campfire, herbal tea bubbling away on a stove, discussing the day’s work. Once synonymous with those taking a break between A-levels and university, or after a degree, the gap year has evolved into a catch-all that includes anyone seeking an escape before joining the workforce. And according to Student Universe, the world’s largest youth travel agency, the post-pandemic era has seen the biggest shift in students’ desire and motivation to travel in 50 years. While pure ‘leisure’ — fly and flop, adventure tours and festivals — still has a place in the market, the prevailing trend among gap year students is for educational or vocational trips. “Their main goal is to do something ethical and responsible,” says Milly Whitehead, co-founder of specialist gap year travel company The Leap. “We’ve seen a huge growth in the demand for volunteering programmes and trips that have a proper structured itinerary.  “They’re so much more discerning and into the fine detail of what a trip will involve than what we’ve seen in the past. The aim really is for a year out to add something to the future value of their CV and their UCAS [Universities and Colleges Admissions Service] form.” It is a stark change from even a decade ago, Whitehead says, when most gap year travellers were happy flitting about until the kitty dried up and it was time to fly home.Her assessment is consistent with the findings of The State of Student and Youth Travel in 2024, the latest annual report by Student Universe. It surveyed 6,000 members of Generation Z — generally defined as those born between the mid-1990s and the late-2000s — in the UK, US, Canada and Australia to assess their motives for travel. It suggested 79% would embark on a trip with the main intention being that the experience would make them more employable. It’s a theme that runs through the report: around 87% believed vocational travel would improve their employability, while 86% said they’d sign up to volunteer on a project related to their ideal future career path. Jemma Gore-Booth, 21, says about half her year group at Emanuel School in southwest London decided to take a gap year before going to university. “Taking a gap year was common,” she says. “Of my nine closest friends, five travelled. I worked as a teaching assistant in London to build up funds and then started with a month in Sri Lanka volunteering as an English teacher before travelling to Thailand and Vietnam.” When Gore-Booth set off for her year abroad in 2021, there were still strict Covid protocols in place, especially in Asia, and the looming threat of further restrictions. Such risks, she says, still made it a more attractive proposition than online learning, plus she’d always intended to take a year out. “I really didn’t want to do any of my university degree online, but I was also nervous about the travel situation,” she says. Gore-Booth is far from alone. Latest figures reveal that a record number of British teenagers who studied for GCSE and A-levels through the pandemic opted to take a gap year before starting further education. Figures from UCAS, released last summer when A-level results were published, showed more than 73,000 students applied to defer their place for a year — an increase of almost 10% compared to the previous year. One of the biggest shifts Whitehead has seen in the 20 years since she and her husband Guy founded The Leap is the pace at which people want to travel. “It really needs to be pacy to keep everybody focused and energised,” she says. “Heaven knows how we kept people entertained for eight weeks back in the day. It was more go and teach in a school in the morning, maybe do something else in the afternoon… but all much slower. That just doesn’t wash now.” These days, she adds, “it has to be ‘bang, bang, bang’: a variety of projects, a variety of adventures. Every day has to be different.” Experiences offered by The Leap include volunteering with organisations such as Oceans Alive Trust, a non-profit organisation that works to halt coral loss and boost fish stocks; beach cleaning in Costa Rica; or assisting with a community reforestation project in Barichara, Columbia. Most programmes average about five weeks and include language learning alongside training in a skill, such as diving. The demand for more structured programmes is a trend that Student Universe is also adapting to. “That desire of younger travellers to think ‘I’ll get on a flight and see where life takes me’ has shifted somewhat,” says Sam Willan, vice president of global marketing. “Maybe it was blissful ignorance, but now our travellers definitely want to feel more looked after.” Willan says the company has also seen a gradual move towards young people taking several shorter trips over the course of a gap year, as opposed to one long adventure. These typically follow a similar pattern: a learning holiday, a working or volunteering trip and then travelling. “It all comes down to career development again,” he says. “There’s a real drive among gappers to end up with experiences that will bolster their CV while building themselves as culturally aware, well-rounded individuals.”When participants in the The State of Student and Youth Travel in 2024 were asked ‘what appeals to you about taking a vacation?’, partying and clubbing came bottom, with just 21% of the 6,000 respondents selecting it. Top of the list was sightseeing and city activities (70%) followed by experiencing different cultures (68%) and relaxing and rejuvenating (61%). According to Willan, gap year operators are also reporting subtle shifts in the countries gappers are choosing, with former staples in Southeast Asia — notably Laos, Thailand and Vietnam — losing some of their lustre and the likes of India, South Africa, Brazil and Peru on the rise.  Whitehead reports a similar trend, with destinations that were among the first to lift Covid border restrictions benefitting from a rise in student travellers. “Central and South America were the first to reopen after the pandemic and really started the drumbeat,” she says. “What we’ve seen is that as more students have travelled there in recent years, word of mouth has followed through year groups. “There’s a feeling they offer more contrast geographically than Southeast Asia. Take Peru, you can be in the Andes one day, on the Amazon the next and on Rainbow Mountain the day after.” For working trips, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are the standout, thanks in part to their Commonwealth status, which opens doors to young travellers from the UK, according to Jenza, a travel agency specialising in working holidays. Last year the UK signed agreements with all three countries to expand the Youth Mobility Scheme visa, increasing the age limit from 30 to 35 and the maximum length of stays from two to three years. “Working holidays are more accessible to today’s youth, as they break down what’s undoubtedly the biggest barrier to entry: money,” says Lucy Lynch at Jenza. Options for students today are, however, more limited than they were. Villa staff, chalet boys and girls, resort reps, childminders and sailing instructors were the mainstay of British package holidays and extremely popular gap year jobs — until Brexit. The UK’s departure from the EU cut off the ability for young people in the country to easily work overseas and reduced the number of services available to holidaymakers. A recent report by trade bodies ABTA and Seasonal Businesses in Travel (SBiT) revealed the number of Britons fulfilling tourism roles overseas has fallen from 11,970 in 2017 to just 3,700 in 2023. This, SBiT says, has a disproportionately greater effect on young people, who’ve traditionally filled such seasonal jobs — working for holiday companies in a year off, say, or during the summer break. It’s also had a huge impact on chalet holidays, beloved of British skiers, which relied heavily on gap year staff who were happy to work for less money in return for bed, board and a lift pass for the season. Charles Owen, managing director of SBiT, says: “It’s proving tremendously difficult to employ the UK staff we need to run our businesses in the EU. In some countries, it’s a mountain of complex paperwork, delays and extra costs that need to be overcome; in others, there isn’t really a workable route.” ABTA is calling for an enhanced seasonal mobility agreement between the UK and EU for tourism workers, as current arrangements apply only to certain roles and limit stays to 90 days. It’s also calling on the UK government to work to extend the Youth Mobility Scheme to the EU. “There’s nothing stopping us doing this,” says Luke Petherbridge, director of public affairs at ABTA. “It is mutually beneficial, not least for the individuals who take part in the scheme and get to live and work overseas. Critically, it’s not part of the wider immigration regime. The mobility scheme doesn’t confer any longer-term rights to remain for those that have taken part.” Many people in the travel sector are hoping that a change in government will pave the way for a closer relationship with the EU and forge a route for young Britons to work in the bloc without expensive, bureaucratic hurdles, which most travel companies can’t afford. SBiT estimates the cost of recruiting a young person from the UK for seasonal work in France (the most popular ski destination for the UK) has risen by £880. One of the biggest decisions gap year students face is how to fund their overseas adventure. Research by recruitment agency Teaching Abroad found that one in five young people rely on parents to help pay for a year abroad. Others, however, are more self-reliant. Minnie Fisher, 18, is currently on a five-month trip taking in New Zealand, Australia and Southeast Asia. She’s paid for the trip by working from last summer until leaving in January this year. “It was hard work but worth it,” she says from Nusa Penida, an Indonesian island near Bali. “After finishing my A-levels last year, I worked pretty much full time in a local cafe and I also did lots of babysitting, too. I saved up £11,000 in all. We used £3,000 for flights and I left with £8,000 in the bank, although I really want to end the trip with at least £2,000 left over.” Gore-Booth is also planning another year out once she finishes her degree at Newcastle University.“No matter what, it would have to involve some element of earning money,” she says. “I’d also want it to contribute in some way to my CV and future work. I’m thinking I’ll do a TEFL [Teaching English as a Foreign Language] course and then go teach English somewhere like Vietnam. I think that would be a brilliant experience.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"

Dr. Rahman explains that this is important because women often need more arch support as they tend to overpronate more than men.  Other features we love about the Gaviota 5 are the padded collar and EVA foam in the midsole. The foam gives the Gaviota 5 its maximum cushioning and helps reduce the shock of each step. The Gaviota 5 has also earned the APMA seal.  Keep in mind: The Gaviota 5 has a low drop, which may pose issues for walkers who primarily land first with their heels, known as a heel strike.

Dr. Javed recommends the shoe for men and points out that men typically have wider, denser feet.  Reviewers have also praised the Clifton 9, mentioning that it has helped reduce the discomfort of conditions like plantar fasciitis. Its midsole is padded with compression-molded EVA foam, cushioning the foot without adding too much extra weight. The early-stage meta-rocker design helps to reduce foot fatigue and energy used by mimicking the rock of a rocking chair. The Clifton 9 earned the APMA seal of acceptance as well.  Keep in mind: The Clifton 9’s toe box may be too small for walkers with wider feet.  Product details: Weight: 7.3oz | Heel to toe drop: 5mm | Stability: Neutral | Cushion: Medium cushioning (The 8 best walking shoes for men) Buy it now at Hoka Why we like it: The Restore TC slip-on is our favorite Hoka slip-on walking shoe for its convenience and comfort. Its laceless design simplifies putting on shoes, making them perfect for daily wear, dog walks, and taking the trash out. “It’s super plush and easy to glide into, making it one of the best stability slip-ons,” says Dr. Javed. The shoe is also advertised as being barefoot friendly thanks to its full-knit sock-like upper. Another feature we love about the Restore TC is its steps toward sustainability, with recycled materials such as dope-dyed polyester and sugarcane-based EVA.  Keep in mind: The exposed foam outsole may wear quickly with extensive outdoor use, impacting traction and longevity. Product details: Weight: 11.30oz | Heel to toe drop: 5mm | Stability: Neutral | Cushion: Max cushioning Buy it now at Hoka Why we like it: The Clifton LS is our top pick for daily walking and standing. A lifestyle version of the popular Clifton running shoe, the Clifton LS inherits the same bottomless cushioning and comfort, making it an excellent choice for daily walking and standing. Key features like the very generously cushioned midsole and smooth heel-to-toe transitions help relieve foot fatigue and discomfort. The Clifton LS is a lifestyle Hoka walking sneaker with beautiful details, such as suede overlays. Its colorways are neutral, making the shoe easier to pair with different styles of clothes.  Keep in mind: Some reviewers have found that the Clifton LS requires a brief break-in period, and others have found the shoe to be narrow. Product details: Weight: 11.30oz | Heel to toe drop: 5mm | Stability: Neutral | Cushion: Medium cushioning Buy it now at Hoka (Women's) (Men's) Why we like it: While Hoka is most known for its running shoes, the brand is also gaining recognition in the outdoor industry thanks to its popular trail running shoe, the Speedgoat. The Anacapa Breeze Mid was our favorite Hoka walking boot because it offers some of Hoka’s standout features, such as that plush comfort the brand is known for, thanks to the compression-molded EVA foam midsole. An aspect that many reviewers loved was the locking lacing system, which was tailored to many foot shapes and needs.  The Anacapa Breeze Mid is quite light for a hiking boot, weighing in at under 12 ounces. It also has quite a few recycled components, with its air mesh made with 100% recycled yarns and recycled polyester used throughout the shoe, including the heel webbing, tongue mesh, and tongue lining. The Anacapa Breeze also has a shoe version for those who prefer a hiking shoe over a boot, and it has earned the AMPA seal of acceptance. Keep in mind: Some users note that the shorter shoelaces can require more frequent adjustments. Additionally, while the Anacapa Breeze Mid offers water resistance, there are better choices for prolonged exposure to wet conditions. Product details: Weight: 11.90oz | Heel to toe drop: 6mm | Stability: Neutral | Cushion: Medium cushioning Buy it now at Hoka (Women's) (Men's) Why we like it: The Hoka Arahi 7 is our favorite pick for those with flat feet. Its standout feature is the J-Frame Stability System. Unlike other stability systems, the J-Frame is a rigid foam that wraps around the medial side of the shoe and the heel in a J shape. This offers support to the arches and reduces overpronation and arch collapse. The Arahi 7 also sits lower to the ground, and Dr. Rahman says this low profile is good for balance, overpronators, and neutral foot types.  Keep in mind: Reviewers have noted that the Arahi 7 is snug, so it may not be best for walkers with wider feet or those requiring more toe room.  Product details: Weight: 8.10oz | Heel to toe drop: 5mm | Stability: Stable | Cushion: Medium cushioning (Do you have bunions? Here are 7 shoes that might help) Buy it now at Hoka (Women's) (Men's) Why we like it: Dr. Rahman has a few pointers when looking for a walking shoe for seniors. “Focus on stability, cushioning, and easy-to-use closures due to the increased risk of falls and the common occurrence of foot problems with age,” she says. “Shoes like the HOKA Transport offer comfort during long walks and are designed to help with balance issues, which is crucial for seniors.” The Transport marks Hoka’s entry into commuter footwear, marrying comfort, style, and durability. We chose Transport as the best Hoka shoe for seniors because of its many features. From the quick-toggle lace system to the pull tab in the back, the shoes are easy to slip on. The Vibram soles also give the shoes great traction, helping to reduce the risk of falls. We also appreciate the eco-friendly materials used, like the 30 percent sugarcane-based EVA midsole and a Vibram EcoStep outsole made with 90 percent less oil. The shoe also has earned the AMPA seal of acceptance.  Keep in mind: Some users have reported squeaking during the break-in period because of the Vibram outsole, though this tends to diminish with time. Product details: Weight: 9.10oz | Heel to toe drop: 5mm | Stability: Neutral | Cushion: Medium cushioning Most Hoka shoes are a great choice for walking. They are known for their cushioned feel and have built up a following among walkers who tend to be on their feet all day, such as healthcare workers. Not only that, but podiatrists tend to love Hokas as well. Many Hoka shoes have earned the APMA seal, signifying they have been recognized for promoting good foot health.  Walking shoes have very different requirements from running shoes. To figure out which Hoka shoe is best for walking, we went through a process of several different filters.    Arch support For walkers with flat feet or high arches, adequate arch support is crucial when choosing which Hoka shoe is best for walking. Look for shoes with built-in arch support or the option to insert orthotic inserts for customized support. Proper arch support helps distribute weight evenly and reduces strain on the feet, ankles, and knees, promoting a more comfortable walking experience. Dr. Rahman says, ""Arch support is essential for preventing overpronation and providing stability, especially for those with flat feet or high arches."" She also notes that women often need increased arch support to prevent or reduce overpronation when they walk.  Cushioning  When considering cushioning in walking shoes, finding the right balance between support and comfort is essential. Look for shoes with ample cushioning in the midsole to provide shock absorption and reduce impact on joints during walking. “Adequate cushioning is essential for all, but seniors, in particular, might benefit from extra cushioning to reduce joint stress,” says Dr. Rahman. Opt for materials like EVA foam or gel padding, which offer a responsive and supportive feel while walking.  Stability and motion control Overpronation occurs when the foot rolls inward excessively, while supination happens when it rolls outward. Both conditions can lead to misalignment and strain on the feet, ankles, and knees, potentially causing discomfort or injury. Many running shoe stores offer free assessments to test if you overpronate or supinate. Stability and motion control features in walking shoes are designed to address these issues. Reinforced heel counters and supportive midfoot structures help maintain proper alignment and prevent excessive foot rolling.  Soles When buying shoes, Dr. Javed recommends finding a shoe with a semi-rigid sole. “If the sole is too flexible, it can destabilize your arches,” she says. Additionally, consider the material of the sole, opting for durable rubber that provides traction and grip on various surfaces. Material While the material may not be the first thing that comes to mind when shopping for walking shoes, the material impacts the overall experience of any walk. Consider the weather and distances on your typical walk. If you tend to walk in hot weather or for long distances, look for shoes with breathable mesh uppers that are well-ventilated.  Which Hoka model is best for walking? Our choice of the best Hoka shoes for walking is the Bondi 8. Not only are they a fan-favorite model for walkers and those who are on their feet all day, but they also offer maximum cushioning, which gives them that cloud-like feel they’re known for.  Are Hoka Cliftons good for walking? Hoka’s Clifton was designed as a running shoe, but it’s also a great Hoka shoe for walking. It’s an especially good fit for those who want a cushioned shoe. The Cliftons are also lighter than most popular walking shoes.  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"
5,Rachel Fairbank,Why health advocates are concerned about a chemical in your decaf,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/decaf-coffee-methods-methylene-chloride,Activists are petitioning the FDA to ban a harmful chemical used to remove caffeine from coffee. But experts say you don't need to panic.,2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Activists are petitioning the FDA to ban a harmful chemical used to remove caffeine from coffee. But experts say you don't need to panic. As more and more people turn to decaffeinated coffee, either due to health concerns or personal preference, there’s growing scrutiny of the methods that are used to remove caffeine from coffee beans—and their health implications. Environmental activist groups have recently petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to consider a ban on a chemical that is popularly used to make decaf coffee. Called methylene chloride, the chemical was recently banned for industrial use by the Environmental Protection Agency, due to the fact that it can cause certain cancers, as well as neurotoxicity, liver damage, and sometimes death. “There are alternatives,” says Jaclyn Bowen, the executive director of the Clean Label Project, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for replacing the use of methylene chloride to decaffeinate coffee with other options. (How the health benefits of decaf compare to regular coffee.) But this doesn’t necessarily mean your decaf habit is in jeopardy. Here’s what to know about methylene chloride—and the alternatives that already exist. To decaffeinate coffee, you need some type of solvent. Soaking coffee beans in a hot mixture of the solvent helps extract the caffeine molecules—leaving behind decaffeinated coffee once the solvent is removed.   “There are basically four main solvents that are used,” says Meredith Worthington, the executive editor for ConsumerLabs.com. These include methylene chloride, which is also called the European method, and is the most widely used method; ethyl acetate, which is sometimes called the “natural solvent,” due to the fact that it is present in a number of fruits, such as bananas and sugarcane; the Swiss water method, which uses hot water to extract the caffeine; and the carbon dioxide method, which uses liquid carbon dioxide. Depending on the method, this can affect the taste, as well as the chemical composition of the coffee.   Methylene chloride has long been the most widely used method, with the Food and Drug Administration mandating that the remaining levels in decaf coffee cannot exceed 10 parts per million. And independent testing of coffee brands has consistently found levels of methylene chloride that are below the FDA limits. (""Forever chemicals"" are hiding in your kitchen. Here's where.) Not everyone agrees that methylene chloride should be banned for decaffeinating coffee. As the National Coffee Association wrote in a recent press release, “The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method decaf—like all coffee—is associated with significant health benefits, including longer lives and reduced risk of multiple cancers and chronic diseases.” Still, Worthington says, “Some people just don’t like that, especially when there are other methods that exist that would result in no concerning solvents. There are a number of companies that only use water in their extraction.”  Another major concern by advocates is the fact that many of the people who are turning to decaffeinated coffee are already more vulnerable to the effects of trace chemicals. This includes pregnant women and people with health conditions, who may decide to switch to decaf for health reasons. As a result, alternatives like the Swiss water method are becoming increasingly used by major coffee companies, such as Peet’s Coffee, due to consumer concerns.  In addition to the concerns about the use of methylene chloride to decaffeinate coffee, there may be some subtle differences in health benefits, depending on which process has been used. ConsumerLabs.com has done testing on the effect of the different types of decaffeination process on green tea, which uses the same processes as coffee beans. “What we found was that brands that decaffeinated the tea using ethyl acetate tended to have lower levels of EGCG, which is considered to be the active constituent of green tea, thought to give it its health benefits,” Worthington says. “Presumably, the same issue would exist for coffee as well.” (How coffee helps forests grow faster.) In another study, published in 2010, researchers looked at the levels of a type of antioxidant that is found in coffee, called phenols. They found that antioxidant levels in decaf coffee did vary according to which extraction method was used, although not by a huge margin. Decaf coffee that was prepared using the Swiss water method or methylene chloride resulted in slightly lower levels of phenols than using ethyl acetate or liquid carbon dioxide. However, in all of these methods, decaf retained more than 80 percent of the original antioxidant levels compared to regular coffee.    In the meantime, people who want to know how their preferred brand of coffee is decaffeinated can check the website CheckYourDecaf.org, or reach out to the coffee company. As Bowen notes, the Clean Label Project is also pushing for coffee companies to list the type of decaffeination process used on their labels, so that consumers can make an informed decision.

6,Meryl Davids Landau,The link between extreme weather and climate change has never been more clear,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/scientists-accurately-pinpoint-climate-contribution-extreme-weather,Experts say drawing the direct connection from specific storms to the nebulous idea of climate change can help people grasp the urgency of our crisis.,2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Experts say drawing the direct connection from specific storms to the nebulous idea of climate change can help people grasp the urgency of our crisis.  A decade ago, scientists would say they were pretty sure a specific hurricane, heatwave, flood, drought or raging wildfire was more severe due to climate change, but they could rarely pinpoint its exact contribution. Now, thanks to a convergence of human brainpower, mathematical models, precise weather data, and superpower computers, climate fingerprints are being calculated for many major weather events.   The purpose of this climate attribution is to drive home the extent that greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuel relates to the weather effects people are seeing.    “We want everyone to understand how what we as humans have done translates into the intensities and frequencies of extreme events,” says Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist at the London-based nonprofit World Weather Attribution (WWA), a leader in this research. “We’re not saying that climate change caused a particular extreme weather event. What we are saying is, ‘Here’s the extent climate change has modified it’.”    More than 400 extreme weather events, many in the past few years, have been studied to determine to what extent the grade of the phenomenon was driven by climate change.     For example, researchers at Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that collaborates with WWA, found that last summer’s heat wave in the Southwestern United States—where temperatures in July were some 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal—was five or more times more likely because of climate change.   Heat waves like that “are not just blips,” but will become much more frequent if the world doesn’t quickly transition away from fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases, says Andrew Pershing, the lead scientist for attribution research at Climate Central.      Complex weather events are triggered by several environmental factors, including high- or low-pressure systems, jet streams, and more. But it’s long been known that warmer air and ocean surface temperatures are additional important contributors that have worsened many recent disasters.    Scientists have calculated, for example, that total rainfall from six of the major hurricanes that struck the Atlantic coast in the past 20 years—Katrina, Irma, Maria, Harvey, Dorian, and Florence—and which collectively caused more than $500 billion in damage, were four to 15 times more intense (depending on the hurricane) than they would have been had the Earth been cooler.   Last year’s unusually warm Midwestern Christmas week was at least twice more likely due to climate change, a Climate Central analysis found. While some put the blame for that snow-free Christmas on El Niño—the periodic warming on the surface of the Pacific Ocean that does affect weather—without global warming the area might have received some holiday snow.   On average, heatwaves that would have happened once in 10 years in pre-industrial times now occur some three times more often, and they’re frequently 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than in the past, WWA says. The record-smashing heatwave that buckled roads in the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada in the summer of 2021 would have been all but impossible without the contribution of climate change.    Scientists now aim to calculate and disseminate these climate fingerprints within days or a few weeks of an extreme weather event, when people are paying close attention, says Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist who calculates attributions at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.  Quickly connecting the dots between the event and greenhouse gases “helps people realize that climate change isn’t our children’s and grandchildren’s problem. Significant things are happening now,” Wehner says. As soon as massive downpours began flowing in Dubai in mid-April this year—in which up to 10 inches of rain fell in less than two days—researchers at WWA dug into the data. A week after the rain, they reported that such an event became twice as likely from today’s climate. Another recent focus is to document the event’s extra impacts rather than just the increased odds. For example, researchers determined that Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in 2017, contained 19 percent more rainfall than would have occurred without climate change, Wehner noted in a paper in Physics Today. Then they figured out what this meant for residents: 14 percent more flooded areas and a quadrupling of the financial loss in what was ultimately a $90 billion storm.  People living in the storm’s path can even review Wehner’s flood model map to learn whether their house would have been spared absent climate change—something he estimates was the case for 32 percent of the damaged homes.   Attribution science relies on climate models showing the impacts of greenhouse gases on the planet, which are then combined with current weather information gleaned from ground stations and weather satellites, historical information from global datasets, and other inputs.   Statistical techniques culled from epidemiology are also used, since that field also teases apart the relative contributions of various factors, such as how much smoking habits, family history, and obesity each contribute to a population’s heart disease odds.   Heatwaves are simpler to calculate than hurricanes, and droughts are toughest of all, Kimutai says. Drought requires knowing not just how much how much rain has or hasn’t fallen but soil moisture levels, air evaporation rates, and other data. In many parts of the world, especially underdeveloped countries, this current and historical data does not exist.   Extraordinary events are also proving challenging. Climate is increasing the frequency of once-in-a-hundred-year events to 10- or 20-years. With the Pacific Northwest heatwave, for example, “we have more than 100 years of data, but there was nothing like it,” Wehner says.    Most of the studies have focused on extreme weather, but everyday life is also different than it would have been without climate change, Pershing says. That’s why two years ago, Climate Central launched its “climate shift” temperature website detailing how each U.S. area’s seven-day forecast diverges from its historical norms.   Minnesota’s site visitors last winter learned that many days were much warmer than usual—which climate change made three or more times more likely.    This type of everyday event may not attract a splashy report from attribution scientists, Pershing says, “but it was certainly important to the residents who live there.”   Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

7,Tom Burson,How to plan a food weekend in Germany’s Rheingau region,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/food-weekend-germany-rheingau,"Spread along the banks of the Rhine, a short hop from Frankfurt, the wine country, ancient forests and dairy pastures of Rheingau provide rich pickings for a new generation of inventive chefs.",2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Spread along the banks of the Rhine, a short hop from Frankfurt, the wine country, ancient forests and dairy pastures of Rheingau provide rich pickings for a new generation of inventive chefs. Thousand-year-old castles, towns of half-timbered houses and pathways winding through rows of prized vines define Germany’s Rheingau, a 300sq-mile region along the River Rhine that stretches from Wiesbaden to Rüdesheim am Rhein. Viticulture has long been Rheingau’s raison d’être, and within its 7,800-acre spread of vineyards you’ll find some of the world’s finest grapes. Old-world wine-country villages such as Kiedrich, Hattenheim and Assmannhausen host restaurants where menus are replete with local vintages and the distinctive dishes of Rheingauer cuisine. Local bounty includes quality meat and dairy from the cows grazing in the wild pastures of the nearby Taunus mountains, along with wild boar, venison, mushrooms and berries found in dense tracts of forest thick with beech, birch and oak. Ancient it may be, but Rheingau has lately gained such a culinary reputation that restaurants new and old are attracting renowned and up-and-coming chefs, bringing some culinary buzz to the Frankfurt backcountry. 1. Groenesteyn, in KiedrichThe views are spectacular at this historic half-timbered house in Kiedrich, in Rheingau’s northeastern reaches. Chef-owner Dirk Schröer has transformed this former 17th-century wine tavern into an equally gemütlich restaurant that serves flavoursome farmhouse food elevated to one-star Michelin standards. Standout dishes on the frequently changing menu may include beef roulade with white asparagus, and halibut with rhubarb and leek, in addition to creative bites like pickled potatoes with sorrel and buttermilk ice cream. The extensive wine list and remarkable view overlooking the vineyards and the 13th-century Scharfenstein castle add to its old-world charm. 2. Schloss Vollrads, in Oestrich WinkelOverlooking the mighty Rhine, surrounded by vineyards, Schloss Vollrads is a pilgrimage spot for those who love riesling. Frühschoppen (a morning tipple and chat) is a delight in the sunlit castle gardens, for travellers making a flying visit. But pause here a while. The 800-year-old estate has been cultivating riesling for as long as it’s been standing, and serving world-class wines and local food since at least 1493. Current chef Alexander Ehrgott has designed a menu that’s as much about wine-pairing as it is regional dishes. Try fried veal steak with turnips, potato terrine and a wine jus paired with a wonderfully dry, aged estate riesling. The chocolate mousse with a tonka bean ice cream is another dish not to miss. 3. Gasthaus Zur Schlupp, in WallufThis charming little restaurant may date back to 1608, but the dishes served by the Ehrhardt family bounce to a contemporary, seasonal tune. Chef Michael and his wife Isabelle, also a sommelier, have run this unpretentious gasthaus since 2000, and it’s become a go-to in the eastern Rheingau town of Walluf. Michael helms the kitchen conjuring Mediterranean-influenced cuisine largely drawn from regional produce, while Isabelle matches those flavours with excellent local wines. Homemade pastas and desserts are menu favourites but it’s really the fragrant soups and stews from Michael’s childhood that define dining here, such as sweet tomato soup with wild garlic dumplings or his creative takes on roast wild goose – a defining Rheingau dish. 4. Adler Wirtschaft Franz Keller, in HattenheimClinking glasses and roaring chatter enliven each wooden table at the crowded Adler Wirtschaft Franz Keller, a buzzing, wine-focused inn with superb food. ‘Simple is the best’ is the guiding philosophy here, with dishes devised from ingredients grown on the Adlers’ farm in the nearby Taunus mountains. Starters include the likes of a goose liver parfait with riesling jelly. Fantastic mains range from white asparagus in a béarnaise sauce with ham from Adler free-range pigs, to aubergine dumplings with a spicy tomato piperade and prime cuts from the steak menu. Don’t forget to round out the meal with a glass of schnapps served from a clanging cart. 5. Jean, in EltvilleSelf-proclaimed ‘wine city’ Eltville is Rheingau’s unofficial capital, and Hotel Frankenbach’s restaurant Jean is conveniently located next to the main railway station – and just a short walk from a romantic promenade along the Rhine. Chef Johannes Frankenbach brings the flavours of France to regional ingredients in such cleverly balanced dishes as duck foie gras with creme brulee, calvados and granny smith apples; a French-Mediterranean bouillabaisse; and a plate of veal kidneys with spinach and black salsify. The exhaustive wine list includes bottles from Rheingau and also Bordeaux, while the wood-panelled ceilings, old photographs and low lighting recall the building’s former life as a simple little wine tavern. The best way to explore Rheingau – taking in its smells, sights and tastes – is to hike around the vineyards. It’s easily done as a self-guided walk, following trails such as the riverside Rheinsteig, or you can book a local guided tour. Bottlestops, for one, runs a range of curated wine excursions that take you from the city of Mainz into Rheingau where you’ll learn about the region’s viticultural history, wine varieties and terroirs with plenty of opportunity to pop into various vineyards en route for tastings. Its ‘Sunday Wine Excursion in Rheingau’ tour takes you on a modified day-long Sonntagsausflug (a traditional Sunday countryside stroll) where you’ll visit historic wine estates and take in expansive rural views, while the ‘Castles, Abbeys and Wine Tour’ visits the region’s centuries-old venues that are still making wine today. Zum Krug, in HattenheimIn the handsome heart of Hattenheim, a Rheingau town famed for its riesling, Zum Krug charms just as much now as it did when it was founded back in the 18th century. Current owners the Laufer family have blended old and new to beautiful decorative effect. Stained glass windows and exposed beams sit alongside masterfully crafted wooden bed frames, chairs and tables topped with traditional ‘bembel’ ceramic wine pitchers. But it’s Zum Krug’s food that makes it an essential port of call. Long-forgotten local dishes like a savoury handkäse cheesecake with sour cherries grace the list of starters, while freshly caught wisperforelle trout with a light riesling sauce is a popular main. For dessert, the fan-favourite, made by the family’s grandmother, is a rye bread ice cream served with vanilla-infused sour cream and rhubarb. Doubles from £130, B&B.

8,Tara Haelle,This is the biggest health challenge women face in their 50s,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/health-challenges-women-50s-menopause,"Other cancer screenings and vaccinations become important, but this decade is dominated by menopause and falling levels of the hormone estrogen.",2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Other cancer screenings and vaccinations become important, but this decade is dominated by menopause and falling levels of the hormone estrogen.  Perhaps no other decade in a woman’s adult life brings as many dramatic changes in health as her 50s.  The average age of menopause in the U.S. is 51, and both menopause and the years leading up to it involve changes in nearly every system within a woman’s body. But many women are surprised by the changes that will occur and how to manage them. “The majority of women don’t know what to expect before it happens,” Asima Ahmad, a reproductive endocrinology and fertility specialist and chief medical officer at Carrot Fertility, says. “Then, even when symptoms start happening, they don’t really have a high level of understanding about the differences between perimenopause and menopause.”  Menopause is when a woman hasn’t had a period for at least one year. Perimenopause is the stretch leading up to menopause, when women begin experiencing symptoms associated with the body’s estrogen production gradually ramping down.  “Everyone’s journey is going to be a little different,” Ahmad says. The median number of years that someone is affected is 7.4, but it extends to between 14 to 20 years for some women. Importantly, it’s also a key period of changes to women’s heart and metabolic health.   “Menopause is an inevitable part of life, and I really see it as another window into future cardiovascular health,” Kathryn Lindley, a cardiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says. Women may seek care for perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms, “but it’s also when their cardiovascular risk factors really start to increase,” Lindley says. “We start to see blood pressure go up, weight go up, blood sugar go up, cholesterol go up, and there’s really an acceleration in risk for things like heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke.”  Heart attacks can feel different in women than men, so it’s important to familiarize yourself with women’s heart attack symptoms. Stroke is an even bigger risk in women than heart attack, so know those signs as well.  Fortunately, plenty of treatments exist for most symptoms of menopause and for lowering risk factors of cardiovascular disease.  “It’s not like one thing is going to work for everyone across the board,” Ahmad says. “Sometimes it takes a little bit of trial and error. What’s really important along the lines of treatment options is finding the right provider.”  Many women may be fortunate to already feel comfortable discussing perimenopausal symptoms with their primary care provider. But Ahmad’s company, Carrot Fertility, discovered last year that one in three women surveyed said they had never even discussed menopause with their doctor. It’s worth starting those discussions early so you can determine if your doctor will meet your needs.  “If you have a provider that doesn’t feel comfortable managing menopause, or you’re looking for a more personal experience, then you can start looking for someone sooner,” Ahmad says.  For all the changes women in their 50s find themselves facing, it’s helpful to know it’s not forever. “I try to impart on patients that, for most women, [perimenopause] is a finite period of time,” Angela Wilson, and OBGYN at Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care says. “At some point, you get to the other side and things start to level out a little bit.”  The first things that come to many women’s minds when they hear “menopause” are “hot flashes.” But perimenopause and menopause can involve a much broader range of symptoms than women may realize. “There’s changing energy levels and fatigue, there’s brain fog and difficulty concentrating, there’s trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, there’s depression, there’s changes to the body’s fat distribution, there’s hair loss, skin changes and bone mineral density changes,” Ahmad says.  Mood symptoms can result from the other symptoms or occur independently. (What happens during menopause? Science is finally piecing it together.) “There are a lot of emotional symptoms that can go along with menopause, such as increased irritability and increased risk of depression and anxiety,” Wilson says. In addition, the body’s loss of estrogen can also lead to vaginal dryness, which has implications for intercourse. Somewhere between 17 and 45 percent of women report pain with intercourse during this time, though underreporting means the proportion may be even higher. The vaginal dryness happens to everyone, Wilson says, “but a lot of times women are surprised when they start experiencing it.”  Not all women will experience all these symptoms, but they are common for millions of women.  (Could menopause be delayed? The answer could lead to longer lifespans for women) As many changes occur because of the body’s loss of estrogen, hormone therapy can be an important treatment option. Unfortunately, misinterpretation of an influential study in 2002 led to years of confusion and misinformation and unfounded fears about hormone therapy. It’s true that hormone therapy is not right for all women and that it involves risks as well as benefits, like any treatment, but for the vast majority of women, the pros outweigh the cons throughout their 50s.  But hormone therapy is not a cure-all either.  “For many people, it will be a combination of hormone therapy plus other treatments,” Ahmad says. Those could include vaginal lubricants, alternative therapies for hot flashes like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or lifestyle modifications, such as wearing cooler clothing and limiting food that exacerbates your symptoms.  Cognitive symptoms may particularly worry women at first, especially if they have a family history of dementia. So how do you know if your difficulty concentrating or remembering things is menopause or the first signs of early dementia?  “If it’s affecting their daily life, their work, family life or the ability to perform day-to-day activities, there may be a problem that needs to be addressed,” Jorge Ruiz, a geriatrician at Memorial Healthcare System in Hollywood, Florida, says. “If it’s annoying, but you can still do everything you person need to do,” then there’s no reason to worry. Finally, postmenopausal women start to lose bone and muscle mass while gaining fat, Lindley says. “So it’s important to continue to do weight-bearing exercises, both to maintain your muscle tone as well as maintain your bone mass.” But be conscientious about risk of injury too, she adds. Lindley recommends patients use lighter weights with more repetitions to reduce risk of injury, and some women may need to opt for biking or swimming instead of running for cardiovascular health.  Ahmad recommends getting a baseline bone mineral density screening early in perimenopause so that it’s possible to see what changes begin happening over time. Women can also protect their bone health with strength training and ensuring they are getting enough vitamin D and calcium.  Wilson says her priority in talking with women in their 50s is looking at their cardiovascular health and screenings for diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. “I really try to counsel patients to take a good look at their lifestyle at that point,” Lindley says. “If you weren’t an exerciser before, you’ve really got to exercise. If you didn’t eat well before, now you’ve really got to change your diet.” She typically recommends a Mediterranean diet that’s high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean meats, such as fish and poultry, and low in fats, sugars and processed foods.  Though many women may be aware that weight gain can accompany menopause, Wilson emphasizes that it’s an overall change in metabolism that’s occurring in their bodies.  That’s why exercise and good nutrition become even more important. “We know that healthy diet and exercise have to be the mainstay of heart health, so even if the scale doesn’t budge, those habits still help maintain our cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure and make people live longer,” Lindley says.   Cardiovascular health is also inextricably linked to brain health, so maintaining a healthy blood pressure also protects the brain long-term, Lindley says.  Lifestyle modifications that help keep blood pressure low include avoiding excess salt in your diet, exercising regularly, losing excess fat, and treating sleep apnea if you have a diagnosis.  “If those lifestyle modifications don’t get the blood pressure where it needs to be, it’s really important that we treat it with medicine because untreated high blood pressure, even if you feel fine, has pretty serious cumulative effects on your heart, brain, and kidneys,” Lindley says. Cancer screenings from previous decades continue, with one or two more, depending on risk factors: 1) Cervical cancer screenings continue with Pap smears every three years, high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing every five years, or both every five years.  2) Colorectal cancer screenings continue with a colonoscopy every 10 years or one of the various non-invasive but non-preventative screenings that can detect early colon cancer.   3) Breast cancer screenings with mammography (or possibly MRI in certain populations) continue every two years. 4) Lung cancer screenings begin at age 50 for those who currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years and have at least a 20-pack-year smoking history (such as a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years).  5) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has not found sufficient evidence to routinely recommend skin cancer screenings. Still, April Armstrong, a dermatologist at the University of California Los Angeles, advises that people at higher risk—those with fair skin, a family history of skin cancer, or more lifetime sun exposure—undergo an exam every year or two because the 50s are when precancerous and cancerous skin lesions can begin appearing, particularly for patients with lighter skin types. (Melanoma is overdiagnosed at ‘alarming’ rates. Here’s what to know.) Unfortunately, menopause can interfere with a lot of basic wellness needs, like good sleep and stress management. Menopause-related weight gain, for example, can sometimes lead women to develop obstructive sleep apnea. If you aren’t feeling refreshed after a full night’s sleep, or you snore or wake up with headaches, consider getting evaluated for sleep apnea.  Other habits remain for maintaining overall wellness: 1) Ask your eye doctor how often you need an exam if you don’t have symptoms or wear corrective lenses.  2) Continue dental cleanings and screenings twice a year. 3) In addition to getting the seasonal flu and COVID vaccines each year, adults 50 and older should get the shingles vaccine to reduce risk of the disease, which one in every three people will develop in their lifetime. The hormonal changes of menopause can also lead to dryness and loss of elasticity in women’s skin and a deepening of wrinkles, Armstrong says. If you haven’t already started using a retinol or retinoid in your evening skincare routine, this is the time to start to undo some of the sun damage to the skin.

9,Rachel Ng,Why you should visit this scenic Vermont town,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-why-visit-stowe-vermont,"A snow-sports haven in the winter, the picturesque town of Stowe in the northeastern US state of Vermont flexes its artistic flair year-round. With an array of diverse attractions, activities and events, discover Stowe in all seasons.",2024-06-11T00:00:00Z,"A snow-sports haven in the winter, the picturesque town of Stowe in the northeastern US state of Vermont flexes its artistic flair year-round. With an array of diverse attractions, activities and events, discover Stowe in all seasons. Under a blanket of powdery snow, Stowe is a natural playground for skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers — affectionately known as the ‘ski capital of the east’. Just a 30-minute drive north of Vermont’s state capital, Montpelier, Stowe is favoured by winter sports enthusiasts, but when the season changes, the historic town undergoes a dramatic mood change. Its rugged hillsides transform from a quilt of ivory to shades of emerald in the spring and summer, before bursting into brilliant hues of yellow, gold, orange and red in autumn. From craft brewery tours and hiking to farmers’ markets and festivals, here are some of the best things to do in Stowe in all seasons. With more craft breweries per capita than any other state, Vermont is a place of pilgrimage for beer connoisseurs. Head over to the rustic-chic, farmhouse-style bar at Idletyme Tap & Tavern, where award-winning brewmaster Will Gilson melds classic European brewing traditions with Vermont hop culture. Sample the smooth, Munich-style Helles Brook lager or try a beer flight featuring six different draft beers. In the summer, grab a table by the Treehouse Bar on the outdoor patio and pair the sudsy brews with a giant Bavarian pretzel. If you prefer beer with a side of art, check out The Alchemist, a family-owned brewery that’s as creative with its craft beers as it is with its aesthetics. Vibrant, eclectic murals cover the walls, ceilings and silo of the brewery, while the ‘beer cafe’ serves the flagship hand-pulled Heady Topper double IPA and bottled sour beers. Food is dished up from Warren’s Kitchen & Catering, a funky food truck parked outside the brewery. Try crowd favourites like the fried avocado tacos, or mac and cheese with pulled jerk pork. Apples may be synonymous with the ‘fall’ season, but visitors can take a self-guided tour of Cold Hollow Cider Mill year-round. One of New England’s top cider producers, the mill continues to make pure apple cider the old-fashioned way — watch a traditional 1920s rack-and-cloth press squeeze juicy McIntosh apples into fresh (non-alcoholic) cider and sample the authentic beverage afterwards. Taste Cold Hollow’s seasonal ‘hard ciders’ (alcoholic ciders), too, before picking up a popular cider doughnut, made with an old-school doughnut machine. Take a stroll through Stowe’s enchanting downtown village, lined with whimsical boutiques, jewellery stores and sweet shops, and marked by the quaint Stowe Community Church with its striking white steeple. To keep you fuelled as you wander, try the homemade oatmeal drizzled with Vermont maple syrup at Café on Main, a cosy spot inside the historic Old Depot building. Just a short walk away, contemporary art centre The Current hosts a variety of exhibitions, lectures, film screenings and workshops throughout the year. Beginning in downtown Stowe, the Stowe Recreation Path is a scenic 5.3-mile trail that connects the village to the green foothills of Mount Mansfield, Vermont’s highest peak. Flanked by serene woods and lush foliage, the path makes for an easy hike — meandering through several parks, across bridges over the trickling West Branch River, and past a swimming hole, a corn maze, farms and restaurants. Further up Mount Mansfield, Smuggler’s Notch State Park is the starting point for several hiking trails, such as the challenging Hellbrook Trail. Throughout the year, Stowe plays host to a diverse range of exciting events. Every Sunday from May to October, the Stowe Farmers Market bustles with local and regional vendors selling fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and cheese, bread and pastries, pickles and preserves, as well as flowers, crafts and more. A jubilant Fourth of July parade, along with festivities and entertainment, marks the national day each year. In August, music enthusiasts gather for the Stowe Jazz Festival, a free, three-day event celebrating the diverse genre and all its sub-genres — including swing, bebop, Brazilian and Afro-Cuban jazz. Then, in October, the town holds its three-day Stowe Foliage Arts Festival, featuring more than 150 artists and artisans displaying their artwork and crafts. Stowe’s events list doesn’t stop there — the Trapp Family Lodge also hosts a series of festivals and events that are open to the public, including Oktoberfest celebrations, outdoor summer concerts, trail running races, holiday brunches and fondue nights. The musically gifted von Trapp family (the inspiration for the film The Sound of Music) settled in Stowe in the 1940s, where the mountain vistas reminded them of their home in Austria. Amid 2,600 acres of rolling hills, the family have welcomed visitors to their grand alpine estate since 1950. Trapp Family Lodge also has an on-site brewery specialising in Austrian-style beer — tour the facility before settling down at the adjacent von Trapp Brewing Bierhall restaurant for a hearty meal of chicken schnitzel or bratwurst.

10,Marlowe Starling,The Florida reef gecko is disappearing—can we save it before it’s too late?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/florida-reef-geckos-sea-level-rise,"The overlooked reptile is earning state-level protections, but it may not be enough to save the species.",2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"The overlooked reptile is earning state-level protections, but it may not be enough to save the species. Beneath dried leaves and palm fronds, the Florida reef gecko lives in relative obscurity. The two-inch critters have speckled brown bodies that blend in with the forest floor, and they can dart off in the blink of an eye. But for such a tiny reptile, it faces some large threats: notably, urban development in one of the fastest growing U.S. states and sea level rise due to climate change. In May, Florida’s wildlife agency decided to move forward with plans to list the reef gecko as threatened, three years after scientists warned that its historic range has dwindled—and what remains is at high risk of going underwater by the end of the century. These geckos have already disappeared completely from nine spots, and their habitat has been reduced to 41 percent of its original size in less than a century, according to recent research. At the same time, South Florida’s stretch of the Atlantic Ocean is predicted to rise between one and three feet by 2080, according to NOAA. “Our concerns with the reef gecko are loss of entire populations,” says Stephanie Clements, a conservation biologist now at the Tropical Audubon Society who led a 2021 study describing dangers to the reef gecko. In a phenomenon called coastal squeeze, sea level rise will begin to swallow parts of the state, promoting people to move inland. But geckos can’t follow. (See how sea level rise is already changing the Everglades.) “If you can't travel more than a hundred meters in 10 or 20 generations, you're not really going to be able to outrun potential problems like sea level rise,” says Aaron Bauer, a biology professor at Villanova University who reviewed the Florida listing proposal as an outside expert. If sea levels rise by seven feet, biologists expect 85 percent of the gecko’s habitat to go underwater. But there’s more to the story. Some scientists say the reef gecko might not belong in Florida at all. In a state overrun with invasive reptiles, the Florida reef gecko is a rarity: It’s the only gecko native to the eastern United States and lives in small pockets of South Florida’s tropical hardwood hammocks, an ecosystem that provides a cool, dry refuge for the gecko and many other species. At Miami’s Simpson Park, a protected hammock preserve, an entire reef gecko population lives within the confines of just eight acres, but “there's no guarantee that it's viable in the long-term,” says conservation biologist Christopher Searcy, a co-author on the 2021 study and head of the Searcy Lab at the University of Miami.  “Of course, coastal areas are where humans most want to develop, so the tropical hardwood hammocks along the coast are highly fragmented,” Searcy says. (Read about a Florida law enacted to protect wildlife corridors.) This habitat is also right in the path of hurricanes, which are becoming more intense due to the changing climate. Protecting other parts of the geckos' remaining habitat from development could help other species as well, says Clements. The rim rock crowned snake, for instance, is threatened in Florida and may be declared federally endangered. Both are important predators in their ecosystems: Reef geckos dine on insects such as beetles, bees, wasps, ants, butterfly and moth larvae, and worms, keeping the hardwood hammock’s forest floor ecosystem in balance. Although the Florida reef gecko is considered a Florida native, some scientists aren't sure. The earliest written record of reef geckos in Florida dates back to 1858 in Key West, a bustling port where geckos could have easily hitched a ride on cargo. But earlier genetic data trace to Key Largo, a more northern island where trade wasn’t as common. This would imply that the geckos rafted to Florida from the Caribbean on their own, if they weren’t already there. (Go inside the debate over whether Florida's flamingoes are native.) The Florida populations are categorized as the subspecies Sphaerodactylus notatus notatus, but the species occurs across the Caribbean. Over its entire range, the reef gecko isn’t as imperiled.  “I still think the jury is out,” says Tony Gamble, a herpetologist at Marquette University in Wisconsin who studies dwarf geckos—a group to which the Florida reef gecko belongs—and their evolution.  Resolving the controversy would require comparing genetic samples from South Florida with those in Cuba or the Bahamas. “Are you preserving something that's part of Florida's native heritage? Things that are native to Florida should be prioritized,” he says. For now, state officials agree that the Florida population is resident.  Now that Florida has listed the gecko as a candidate for the threatened species list, state scientists will draft a management plan by 2025 that outlines the animal's protections in more detail. “What's going to be really critical to effectively conserving the species is thinking ahead into the future and having a really strong recovery plan,” says Elise Bennett, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that advocates for endangered species. (Read about a Florida ecosystem that's a battleground for development.) Part of that will be stricter building permits. At the state level, developers can easily find loopholes for so-called cryptic species—those that are difficult to find because they live underground or are otherwise elusive, Bennett says. What’s more, the listing process takes years. “Decisions still need to be made,” Gamble says. We “don't have a lot of time for people to sort everything out.” Microscale critters such as the reef gecko also represent a large gap in conservation, he adds. “Little things need conserving, and they are being affected just as much as the big, charismatic megafauna,” Gamble says. “For every elephant or panda, you’ve got dozens or hundreds of these little things that are in the same boat.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

11,Chelsey Stone,The Chicago River was a toxic wasteland. Now it's an urban oasis.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/what-to-do-along-the-chicago-river,Four sites along Chicago’s waterways reveal remnants of the river’s industrial past alongside restoration efforts that reveal its wild future.,2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Four sites along Chicago’s waterways reveal remnants of the river’s industrial past alongside restoration efforts that reveal its wild future. Chicagoans have long avoided the Chicago River—a waterway once so heavily polluted that its stench could make people sick. Since French explorers first charted it in 1673, the river has been manipulated, dredged, and channelized to support Chicago’s growing population. It served as a transportation artery and a dumping ground for industrial and human waste. The polluted river contaminated the city’s drinking water and caused frequent cholera epidemics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Instead of directly addressing the pollution, the city reversed the river’s flow to bring clean water from Lake Michigan. With changing public perception and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, citizens finally had a government agency and regulations, like the 1972 Clean Water Act, to hold polluters accountable. Friends of the Chicago River, Openlands, Urban Rivers, and other organizations have spent years protecting and improving the waterway.  (Parisians want to recover a legendary river now buried under the city.) These efforts have improved the water’s quality, and now Chicagoans are embracing their river, which touches a third of Chicago’s 77 community areas. “I really have to stress to people the incredible opportunity we in Chicago have to turn this river back into the pride of our city,” says Phil Nicodemus, research director at Urban Rivers. From the North Branch of the Chicago River to the Little Calumet River, here’s how travelers can witness the remnants of the industrial past alongside efforts to restore and protect these waterways for future generations.  Before European settlement, the North Branch of the Chicago River was a thriving marshland. Drained and deforested to meet the needs of settlers, this area has now seen significant restoration efforts. At River Park, where the North Branch and North Shore Channel converge, visitors can observe the scars of a 1910 dam and the successful advocacy that led to its removal in 2018, allowing fish to travel freely from Goose Island to the Skokie Lagoons. Visitors can walk, run, or bike the North Shore Channel Trail or head south to the Riverview Bridge. Or launch a canoe from River Park to get view the cityscape from the water. Goose Island, an impractical site for naturalization due to its corrugated metal shoreline, now hosts the world’s first floating eco-park: the Wild Mile. This innovative project, anchored to the seawall, creates a wetland ecosystem for a diverse range of wildlife “people don’t expect to find deep in the city: beavers, muskrats, snapping turtles, and all types of insects, bats, and fish,” says Nicodemus. Travelers can look for wildlife on the boardwalk, imbibe at Off Color Brewing’s adjacent patio, attend an Urban Rivers event, or kayak with the Shedd Aquarium. At Bubbly Creek, once notorious for the pollution described by Upton Sinclair in The Jungle, “people can stand at the spot that connected Chicago to the rest of the continent,” Nicodemus says. The Illinois & Michigan Canal, opened in 1848, connected the Chicago River to the Mississippi River, facilitating trade from the East Coast.   (Here’s how urban parks are bringing nature close to home.)  Urban Rivers and their partners have installed 3,000 square feet of floating wetlands to transform this once-degraded stretch of the river into a wildlife oasis. “While Bubbly Creek still has its challenges,” says Nicodemus, “it’s a reminder of what the whole river system could look like—if enough care and attention is paid to clean pollution long forgotten about.” Visitors can best see the the wetlands from Park No. 571 or Canal Origins and Canalport Riverwalk parks, which pay tribute to the Illinois & Michigan Canal. A short 30-minute drive from downtown, Beaubien Woods is the starting point of the African American Heritage Water Trail. It honors 180 years of African American history on the waterway that connects Lake Michigan to the Mississippi. “Paddling along the water trail can be ethereal and spiritual,” says Lillian Holden, regional water trails manager at Openlands, which offers guided tours. “When you combine the narration of history with nature, it’s a larger than life experience, especially if you understand the gravity of the stories as it relates to black history and American history.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

12,Travel,Going off-grid in south-central Colorado’s San Luis Valley,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-going-off-grid-in-south-central-colorado-san-luis-valley,Two celebrities test their off-roading skills in the all-new Toyota Land Cruiser.,2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Two celebrities test their off-roading skills in the all-new Toyota Land Cruiser. There are two critical parts to any adventure: getting to your destination and then getting back. Adventure takes on a whole new meaning in Colorado's rugged and remote San Luis Valley. This vast expanse, spanning 8,000 square miles, is a playground for the daring. Majestic mountain ranges, including the San Juans, Sangre de Cristos, and the Saguache Mountains flank it. With nearly a dozen ""Fourteeners"" (14,000-foot mountain peaks) and one of the world's largest high desert valleys at 8,100 feet in elevation, it's a haven for those who seek to venture off the beaten path. And what better way to do so than with the all-new Toyota Land Cruiser, a versatile vehicle designed to conquer any terrain and adapt to any adventure. For Colorado-born National Geographic Photographer Keith Ladzinski, the San Luis Valley is one of his ideal spots for adventure, offering a thrilling experience of off-roading, rock climbing, backpacking, and backcountry exploration. But that's not all, there's a myriad of other landscapes to discover: alpine lakes, wetlands, grasslands, deserts, forests, and rugged mountains.   Not only did Ladzinski return to the San Luis Valley to capture an off-the-beaten experience, but Toyota also headed to the area with the Get Back Challenge to test the all-new Toyota Land Cruiser's off-roading capabilities with two unlikely celebrities. Hilary Swank and Jimmy O. Yang were blindfolded and dropped onto the plateau of a snowy mountain, armed with nothing but a paper map and the all-new Toyota Land Cruiser to test their survival skills. Among off-road enthusiasts, this adventure vehicle is Toyota's longest-running nameplate, known for being ""the truck that gets you back"" no matter how far off the grid you get. To test out this theory, award-winning actor Hilary Swank and her energetic director friend Deon Taylor formed one team, and actor/comedian Jimmy O. Yang and his ever-critical father, Richard Ouyang, formed another. Armed with an all-new Land Cruiser, each team attempted to get back to civilization using their unique route. Their journeys took them across hundreds of acres of pristine wilderness in the San Juan Valley, dotted by challenging gravel and dirt roads. Both teams navigated hairpin turns and steep inclines while trying not to get distracted by the stunning mountain views – or the abundance of local wildlife. When neither made it back by nightfall, they each set up camp in the wilderness. The next day, the terrain threw them some curveballs. Swank encountered mud that would freeze most vehicles. Yang expertly drove over some fallen trees before encountering a boulder blocking the path; emboldened by his success in brand-new circumstances, he navigated around it at a 45-degree angle. This is when it's critical to have a vehicle that can handle any terrain. The all-new Land Cruiser's full-time four-wheel-drive provides continuous power to the front and rear axles for improved traction and stability and features three distinct drive modes: Sport Mode has sharp acceleration, Eco Mode adjusts the throttle for maximum efficiency, and Normal Mode uses fuel economically while maintaining performance. At the end of the challenge, both Swank and Yang arrived at a lodge, proud of how they navigated the obstacles nature threw at them without incident. Whether you're a lifelong adventurer or new to off-roading, if you want to get into the wilderness and get back, it might be best to trust the all-new Land Cruiser. *Prototype shown with options.

13,Parissa DJangi,How the American Revolution estranged Ben Franklin and his Loyalist son,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/ben-franklin-son-feud-american-revolution,Benjamin Franklin had an exceptionally close bond with his son—until the American Revolution pitted them against each other.,2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Benjamin Franklin had an exceptionally close bond with his son—until the American Revolution pitted them against each other. To generations of Americans, Benjamin Franklin is a Founding Father. But to William Franklin, his only surviving son, he was simply “father.” The two men had an exceptionally close bond, and Benjamin affectionately shepherded his son’s budding career. Yet the very thing that cemented Benjamin Franklin’s legacy also threatened to destroy his relationship with his son. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Benjamin sided with the colonies––and William sided with the crown. Could their relationship survive the war? Benjamin Franklin became a father when William entered the world sometime around 1730. The child’s exact birth date remains a mystery, as does his mother’s identity. There was a good reason for that: William was illegitimate. Benjamin was committed to raising his child and seeing to it that the circumstances of his birth would not define him. Benjamin entered a common-law marriage with Deborah Read, his former sweetheart in Philadelphia, in 1730. Benjamin and William were a packaged deal, and Read had no choice but to accept her husband’s illegitimate son. (Do you have a morning routine? Here's how Ben Franklin started his day.) Two more children followed. Francis Folger Franklin was born in 1732, but tragically contracted smallpox and died when he was only four years old. In 1743, Deborah Franklin gave birth to Sally, a daughter. That made William his father’s only surviving male heir. And Benjamin had great expectations for him.  Benjamin Franklin had been a self-made man, but he saw to it that his son wouldn’t have to be. He hired tutors to educate William from the age of four until he was old enough to go to an academy serving Philadelphia’s well-to-do families. Benjamin was preparing William to become a gentleman. He also steered his son into a life of service to the colonial state. William served in King George’s War from 1746 to 1747 before taking on positions as a clerk in Pennsylvania’s colonial assembly and with the postal service.   Benjamin’s strong bond with his son only deepened as William grew up. William Strahan, a family friend, described William as his father’s “friend, his brother, his intimate, and easy companion.” When Benjamin Franklin went to London in 1757, he brought his son with him. Benjamin would act as Pennsylvania’s colonial agent; William would study law. Together, they toured the country, made notable friends, and excitedly witnessed the coronation of King George III in 1761. (The legacy of George III—the last king of America.) When William Franklin returned to the colonies in 1763, he did so with a wife––Elizabeth Downes––and a new appointment: Royal Governor of New Jersey. He took his role seriously, applying his legal education to the administration of a British colony. He governed New Jersey during a trying time. A series of taxes and policies provoked the ire of many colonists, whose calls for independence from the British Empire began to crescendo. Why should Parliament, an institution in which they had no direct representation, hold any authority over them?  William did his best to uphold the crown’s authority while also understanding colonists’ frustrations. But one man couldn’t hold back the tide of revolution. As his son was managing an increasingly perilous political situation in New Jersey, Benjamin Franklin was navigating his own political firestorm in London. He initially hoped for a reconciliation between the colonies and Britain. But Benjamin soon changed his tune. Disgusted with Parliament’s punitive response to the protests in the colonies, he now believed that the British government held his fellow colonists in “the utmost Contempt.” Benjamin Franklin finally quit London in March 1775, just as relations between Britain and its North American colonies reached a breaking point. As his ship crossed the Atlantic in April, colonial militiamen and British regulars clashed at Lexington and Concord. The Revolutionary War had begun. (What really happened at the battles of Lexington and Concord?) The conflict pulled father and son apart. Benjamin was now an ardent patriot; William remained a committed Loyalist.  That didn’t stop Benjamin from attempting to convert his son to his cause. He even urged William to resign his position as royal governor. William refused. On at least one occasion, their discussion turned into a shouting match. Finally, Benjamin accepted the bitter truth: William had declared his independence from his father, and so Benjamin was prepared to banish him from his life. Indeed, William Franklin paid dearly for his loyalty to the crown. Though a well-liked governor, his popularity and family connections weren’t enough to shield him during the war. In 1776, he was arrested and imprisoned. Continental Congress, the governing body of the colonies during the war, didn’t even allow him to visit his wife on her death bed in 1778, despite a personal appeal from George Washington. Benjamin Franklin did nothing to intervene. The end of the Revolutionary War in 1783 didn’t end the estrangement between father and son. Exiled from the land of his birth, William relocated to England, hoping to rebuild his life among the friends he once had there.  He also hoped to reconcile with his father. In 1784, William reached out to Benjamin, who was in France on congressional business. He asked if it would be possible for them “to revive that affectionate intercourse and connexion which till the commencement of the late troubles had been the pride and happiness of my life.” Benjamin wasn’t ready. “[N]othing has ever hurt me so much, and affected me with such keen sensations, as to find myself deserted in my old age by my only son; and not only deserted, but to find him taking up arms against me in a cause wherein my good fame, fortune, and life were all at stake,” he wrote William on August 16, 1784. Benjamin Franklin finally agreed to meet his son in Southampton, England, in 1785. Yet when William arrived at the meeting place, any hope for a rehabilitation of their special bond was dashed. Benjamin asked his son to apologize for his Loyalism during the war; William would not.  They never saw each other again.

14,Stephen Moss,How to plan a birdwatching trip to the Scottish Highlands,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/scottish-highlands-birdwatching,"A visit to the Scottish Highlands offers one of the best bird-and wildlife-watching experiences in the UK, with the promise of rare encounters with unique species.",2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"A visit to the Scottish Highlands offers one of the best bird-and wildlife-watching experiences in the UK, with the promise of rare encounters with unique species. The Scottish Highlands — especially the Cairngorms National Park and Spey Valley — has a reputation as one of the best places to go birdwatching in the UK. This stunning national park is home to species that are either rare or completely absent elsewhere in the UK, including the majestic golden eagle, elusive capercaillie, tiny crested tit and three high mountain specialists: ptarmigan, dotterel and snow bunting. These birds aren’t always easy to see: you’ll have to trudge up mountains, walk along wooded river valleys and search through pine forests to find them — all while enjoying some of the most spectacular landscape in the country. Together with wonderful views, excellent accommodation, great places to eat and drink, and the famous malt whisky, the Highlands are a very enticing package to newcomers as well as experienced birdwatchers. So pack your walking boots and waterproofs, grab your binoculars and get twitching. The Cairngorm Plateau is the only ‘arctic-alpine’ habitat in the British Isles, which means several species that specialise in living at high altitude breed there. Only one is so well adapted that it can survive on the high tops of the mountains all year round: the ptarmigan, whose name derives from the Scots Gaelic word for its distinctive croaking call, which echoes around the spectacular scenery. Actually seeing this bird can be tricky though, since ptarmigan are masters of camouflage, moulting into three distinct plumages in a single year (including almost pure white in winter). But if you sit quietly and carefully scan the rocky slopes, you’ll eventually see them. Another much smaller bird, the snow bunting, spends the spring and summer on the high tops, alongside the ptarmigan. Each year a few pairs breed in snow-filled corries — sheltered dips formed by glacial erosion — where they sing their tuneful song. After breeding, they head down the mountain; some go all the way down to the coast, while others stay much closer to home, in the car park at the bottom of the funicular railway that takes visitors up to the top of Cairn Gorm itself. Snow bunting flocks can be very tame, foraging for scraps of food left deliberately or accidentally by the many visitors. The third mountain speciality, the dotterel, is only here during the late spring and early summer months, having migrated all the way from its winter home in North Africa. The dotterel is a wader, but with a difference: unlike its marsh-loving relative, it breeds on the tops of mountains. It also has a bizarre sex life, with the more colourful and assertive females laying their clutch of eggs and then heading off to Norway to breed again. This leaves the drabber male to incubate the eggs and raise the chicks. A day’s birdwatching on the Cairngorm Plateau may only produce half a dozen species — you might also see red grouse, meadow pipit, wheatear, ring ouzel and, if you’re lucky, golden eagle — but combined with the mountain scenery, it’ll certainly be a fruitful day. Much of the land below the plateau is covered in trees: both the Scots pine and the more open birch woods. These forests are full of special birds and other wildlife, but can also feel as if they’re totally deserted, as the wild creatures that live here are very good at hiding away. An early morning start on a fine, calm day will help, as it enables you to notice the tiny movements that give away a bird’s presence in the dense foliage and also, in late winter and spring, hear the birdsong. In the pine forests, there are coal tits, treecreepers and goldcrests, while the crested tit — more or less unique to this area of the Highlands — can be hard to see. Listen out for its distinctive call. Siskins and chaffinches are very common, and along with the various tit species, will often come to bird feeders in car parks, where you can get close-up views and take photographs. The most elusive bird of these forests is also the largest: the mighty capercaillie, whose name also derives from Scots Gaelic, meaning ‘horse of the woods’, because of its bizarre call. The world’s largest species of grouse — the size of a turkey — used to be common here, but numbers have plummeted in the past few decades and birdwatchers are now asked not to go off the forest paths to search for them, as they’re very vulnerable to disturbance. If you’re very lucky, you might come across one at dawn or dusk as you walk along the forest trails — if so, be sure to keep your distance. The birch woods are easier places to watch birds: listen out for the delicate song, descending the scale, of the willow warbler, which returns here in late April all the way from Southern Africa to breed. Speyside — or Strathspey as it’s known in Scotland — is named after the River Spey, which flows through this valley in sight of the Cairngorms. As well as being a beautiful river in its own right — and supplying water for some of the best malt whiskies in the world — it’s home to a host of birds. Look out for the dipper — which birdwatching hero Bill Oddie once described as “like a cross between a wren and a torpedo” — the only British songbird that regularly submerges under water. Plump and about the size of a thrush, it’ll bob up and down on rocks in the fast-flowing river, and then plunge beneath the surface to grab aquatic insects with which to feed itself and its young. Two other birds also perch on rocks and bob up and down: the resident grey wagtail, which despite its name has bright lemon-yellow underparts, and the common sandpiper, a smart little wader that spends the winter in Africa. One species of duck — the goldeneye — was once only a winter visitor here, but in the past few decades, they’ve colonised as a breeding bird. Today, the black-and-white males and grey, chestnut-headed females can be seen all year round. Make sure you also visit some of the many lochs that are dotted around the lowlands here. Special birds include the black-throated diver (on larger areas of water) and the Slavonian grebe (on smaller ones). Do keep an eye out for large raptors overhead — golden and white-tailed eagles are regularly seen. Perhaps the most famous bird of prey, however, is the osprey, which returned to the area to breed in the 1950s and is now commonly seen hunting for fish on the larger lochs from April through to August. If you can tear yourself away from the rivers and lochs, it’s worth spending at least a day on the nearby coast. Head to Spey Bay, Black Isle and the Moray Firth where, ducks, geese and waders are the main attractions, especially in winter or during the peak migration periods of spring and autumn, while ospreys often hunt for fish here. Target birds include the largest British duck, the eider, whose calls resemble a very human-sounding “oooh”. In winter, there are large flocks of greylag and pink-footed geese, while waders such as dunlin, sanderling, curlew and redshank are found in huge numbers — sometimes accompanied by rarer species. Offshore, you might also see gulls, terns, divers and distinctive auks such as the guillemot and razorbill. While birds are the main attraction, there are plenty of other wild creatures found here. The pine woods are home to red squirrels — which can be easy to spot as they clamber around the branches above your head — and pine martens, which are more elusive. If you walk up the path to Cairn Gorm, you have a very good chance of coming across our only truly montane mammal — the mountain hare. This animal, like the ptarmigan, turns almost completely white in winter. Other easier-to-see mammals include red deer. Also, don’t forget to check the forest floor for colonies of wood ants, which emerge on a sunny day and whose colonial behaviour can be quite mesmerising to watch.

15,Parissa DJangi,What it was like to be first on the scene after the Jonestown massacre,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/jonestown-guyana-first-responders-eyewitness-account,Some of the first people to touch down in Guyana in November 1978 remember what they saw at the scene where over 900 people died.,2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Some of the first people to touch down in Guyana in November 1978 remember what they saw at the scene where over 900 people died. By November 1978, U.S. Air Force Special Operations sergeant David Netterville had served for nearly seven years and had completed a tour in Vietnam. But nothing could’ve prepared him for what he saw in Jonestown, a commune led by Jim Jones in the forests of Guyana. “It was unprecedented,” says Netterville, who gave his first ever broadcast interview for the National Geographic docuseries Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown. “I was just totally shocked at the number of bodies that were laying on the ground.” (Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown will premiere June 17 on Hulu and August 14 on National Geographic) The victims had been members of Peoples Temple, a religious movement Jones founded in the United States. In the 1970s, Jones had led them from California to Guyana, where they built Jonestown. Jones promised it would become a utopia. Instead, Jones gave them death.  Arriving at Jonestown on November 20, Washington Post reporter Charles Krause did not immediately register the mass of colors on the ground below as an unfathomable number of human bodies. “It just looked like confetti that had been thrown around it,” he says. “But each of those pieces of confetti was the shirt or dress or something of a dead person.”  Just two days before, on November 18, 1978, Jones compelled many in his congregation to consume a cyanide cocktail and end their lives. Though he had trained the community to prepare for their deaths, there is evidence that some people may have been forced to consume the poison unwillingly or had it injected into them.  Many fathers, mothers, children, teachers, and nurses remained where they had fallen. For the first responders who arrived days after the massacre, it was a scene they would never forget.  Since Jonestown’s population was primarily Americans, officials called in the U.S. military to gather information. Netterville and his team did not know what happened there—only that Congressman Leo Ryan had been gunned down near the commune. Both Netterville and Krause remember the same thing about approaching the site: the unmistakable, horrific smell of death. The scent even invaded the helicopters high above. As Netterville explains, “A human body is the worst smell you can ever smell. Multiply a dead cow times ten.” To mask the odor as much as possible, he eventually fashioned a mask by “cut[ting] a bandana out of a pillowcase and put[ting] Old Spice lotion on it.” The bodies, already attracting bugs, were decomposing in the heat and humidity. “The bodies were so bloated that […] it was very hard to distinguish who they were,” says Krause, who was one of the first journalists to arrive at Jonestown after the massacre. The scene was made even more horrific when the first responders noticed the children, who ranged in age from babies to teenagers. Netterville recalls, “Some of the people that died were actually holding onto their children.” Animals weren’t spared: Netterville remembers seeing the bodies of murdered dogs. Someone had even taken the time to shoot Mr. Muggs, a chimpanzee that came with Peoples Temple from California. “I just could not believe it. Why would you kill the animals?” Netterville remembers his team divided the land into sections and started counting corpses, one after the other. They initially calculated 450 bodies. When they radioed headquarters with the tally, Netterville remembers “they didn’t want to believe us… They had us repeat that number three times.” As horrific as that number was, it turned out to be a massive undercount. “We didn’t know there were people underneath. They were laying on top of each other,” Netterville recalls. With each new discovery, the death toll of the November massacre climbed higher and higher. The final total was 918 souls, 909 of whom died on site. Now a ghost town, Jonestown eerily exhibited remnants of the commune’s final, chaotic hours––paper cups strewn across the ground, syringes scattered on tables, people holding onto each other as death came for them. A 55-gallon drum was found containing a purplish concoction––a cocktail of cyanide, sedatives, and Flavor-Aid. Netterville remembers military personnel dumped it out on the ground.  Jim Jones’s cabin acted as a window into how he ran the Peoples Temple.  “He had several pictures there of his family,” Netterville says. He had leveraged his interracial family to manipulate the press and members of the congregation while he tried to dodge allegations of abuse within the community. Netterville used a crowbar he found to pry open a large safe in Jones’s house. “It was full of social security checks” from the senior residents who contributed their monthly payments to the commune, he remembers. It also included “boxes of passports. [Jones] took the passports so that people could not leave.” Some had managed to escape death in those final hours, however. Odell Rhodes had seen the early stages of the massacre before hiding and fleeing to a nearby village. Hyacinth Thrash was asleep in her bed when the killings started, and so she survived. Tim Carter, another survivor, was tasked with a special mission just as the killings began on November 18. One of Jones’s mistresses asked him to take suitcases of money to the embassy of the Soviet Union in Georgetown. The assignment enabled Carter to walk out of Jonestown alive––but not before seeing his wife and baby die. “After that, I was beyond even thinking. All I heard in my brain is, ‘You cannot die, you cannot die, you cannot die, you must live, you must live, you must live.’” The ones who didn’t survive left Jonestown in body bags. Some were claimed by their family and privately buried. The remaining 409 were interred in a mass grave in Oakland, California. Though the work of first responders was over, the act of witnessing Jonestown’s horror left its mark. After using Old Spice to mask the stench of death, the scent still haunts Netterville. “I don’t use [Old Spice] anymore. I can’t stand the smell of it ever again.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"
16,James Litston,"Where to stay in Adelaide, South Australia",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/adelaide-australia-where-to-stay-hotels,A clutch of new design-led hotels pays tribute to the South Australian capital’s landmarks.,2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"A clutch of new design-led hotels pays tribute to the South Australian capital’s landmarks. The capital of South Australia, Adelaide has traditionally been seen by international visitors as a gateway destination — a jumping-off point for discovering the natural wonders on its doorstep. Among them, the Adelaide Hills are a bucolic wine region, while Kangaroo Island, just off the mainland, is home to sea lions, koalas and native bird species. But in recent years, the city has discovered a fresh sense of energy and drive that’s shaking off its reputation as a sedate country capital. As well as expanding its laneway scene of bars and restaurants, it’s welcomed a raft of cool, design-friendly digs — all of which are helping to narrow the gap between the big-hitting cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Vibe is the fourth address by the homegrown hotel group known for its affordable yet stylish properties. Opened in 2023 the East End of the CBD (Central Business District), it occupies an 18-storey glass-fronted structure by the Adelaide Parklands, a green belt encircling the inner city. This urban-meets-nature setting is reflected in the 123 guest rooms, which blend wall-to-wall windows and raw concrete ceilings with wooden bathroom screens and luxurious details like high-thread-cotton bedding. The ones on upper floors also come with views across the treetops and winery-rich Adelaide Hills beyond. It’s a landscape that’s easily explored by taking advantage of the city’s free bike-hire scheme. Even closer to hand are locations featured in the city’s roster of festivals, such as the Adelaide Fringe and WOMADelaide. And after a day exploring, you can sit at Storehouse, the lobby-level diner that flows into an outdoor courtyard filled with native Australian plants. Dinner dishes could include seared kangaroo loin with black garlic, pickled grapes, pumpkin seeds and saltbush, or linguine with king prawns from nearby Spencer Gulf — all paired with local wine. From A$239 (£124). The Adelaide Fringe comes to the city from mid-February, and the Indigo celebrates it with posters and memorabilia. The vibrant design goes hand in hand with the hotel’s setting next to Adelaide Central Market — the biggest covered market in the Southern Hemisphere, packed with colourful produce. Indigo’s modern Australian restaurant, Market & Meander, also keeps things local — although the biggest draw is the rooftop bar, the city’s highest. From A$202 (£105). This luxurious hotel has a spa and a terrace overlooking the River Torrens and an extensive urban park. It’s part of the SkyCity Adelaide casino complex, which is in turn set inside the heritage-listed Adelaide Railway Station building. A highlight of the culinary options, The Guardsman restaurant occupies the station’s former Great Dining Hall and retains original flooring and lights. From A$339 (£176). This aptly named hotel connects directly to the Adelaide Oval sporting stadium. It’s a few steps from the arena’s visitor centre and RoofClimb experience for behind-the-scenes tours, while its Bespoke Wine Bar & Kitchen looks right onto the Oval’s hallowed pitch. Away from the field, the guest rooms offer great skyline views. From A$299 (£155).  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

17,Helen Bradshaw,What causes multiple sclerosis—and why are women more at risk?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/multiple-sclerosis-ms-cause-treatment-ebv,"Millions worldwide suffer from this debilitating disease. Symptoms vary widely, and there’s no known cure.",2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Millions worldwide suffer from this debilitating disease. Symptoms vary widely, and there’s no known cure. On-screen, Christina Applegate moved audiences to fits of laughter as a cynical widow on Dead to Me, but off-screen, her toes started tingling. Within months, she was in a wheelchair, the actress revealed in a recent interview with ABC News. Then came her multiple sclerosis diagnosis. But Applegate’s symptoms didn’t stop there. Lesions in her brain caused pain all over her body. She began to experience depression, too. “I don’t enjoy living…I don’t enjoy things anymore,” Applegate said on the June 4 episode of her podcast, MeSsy. “It feels really fatalistic,” she said.  Around 2.9 million people worldwide—roughly one million in the United States—have multiple sclerosis or MS; Applegate and The Sopranos star Jamie-Lynn Sigler are two of them. In their podcast, the actresses speak candidly about their experiences with the disease. MS affects the central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks sheaths of a material called myelin that surround nerve fibers. Like insulation on wires, myelin protects nerves and helps transmit signals. But when myelin deteriorates, the nerve fibers underneath are exposed. This disrupts the brain’s communication and leaves behind lesions, which can cause a myriad of symptoms as the disease progresses. But even several years before intense symptoms develop, the nervous system may already be under fire, says Riley Bove, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. “[The symptoms don’t] quite make it to the threshold of someone going to the emergency room,” she says, but things might not feel quite right. There’s no definitive test for MS. Instead, the disease is diagnosed through clinical history and brain scans that reveal multiple lesions in different areas that formed at different times. MS impacts individual people in unique ways. “If you’ve met one person with MS, then you’ve [only] met one person with MS,” explains Leigh Charvet, who directs MS research at New York University. Symptoms can vary widely, and much about the disease remains unknown. However, research is beginning to elucidate the disease's origins and potential treatments. MS is often categorized as relapsing-remitting, where symptoms go away and come back, or progressive, where they continually get worse. But Bove says this is a false dichotomy. “Everyone experiences worsening symptoms because everybody is experiencing aging,” she says. As our bodies age, we lose muscle mass and strength. On top of that, MS patients experience accelerated aging, Bove says, exacerbating these losses. Instead of focusing on the relapsing versus progressive dichotomy, she says it’s more important to understand if the MS is active, where new lesions actively create symptoms. These symptoms may include numbness, slurred speech, vision issues, and loss of coordination, but others are less detectable. So-called invisible symptoms, like fatigue and bladder dysfunction, are more common and difficult to treat, says Charvet. Because these symptoms are also harder for those without MS to see, “it’s a burden to get support and empathy,” says Bove. Depression, like Applegate described, is common with MS, with around half of patients experiencing it at some point after diagnosis. Depression can be from a reaction to news of the disease, but evidence also suggests that other factors play a role, like damage to the brain, says María Gaitán, acting director of the Neuroimmunology Clinic at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland. There’s no definitive cause of MS, but there is a prominent lead: the Epstein-Barr virus, known as EBV. In a study of over 10 million adults, the risk of developing MS increased by over 30 fold after EBV infection, researchers reported in Science back in 2022. If you’re reading this, you’ve likely already been infected by EBV. The virus spreads through saliva, and “virtually everyone has EBV,” says Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and an author of the study. But that’s not necessarily a cause for concern. The virus itself may be asymptomatic and fall dormant, and because about 90 percent of adults worldwide have had an EBV infection, the odds of developing MS remain about the same as the global average. Ascherio likens the connection between the virus and MS to the connection between smoking and cancer. “Smoking causes lung cancer, but most smokers will never get lung cancer,” he says. So, EBV could cause MS, but most people infected with EBV won’t develop the disease. EBV may not be the one definitive cause of MS, but for now, it’s the leading culprit. Beyond EBV infections, other factors may increase the risk of MS. Women are about three times more likely to get MS, and scientists don’t know why. One theory is that women are more susceptible to autoimmune issues because of how responsive their immune systems must be to tolerate the foreign DNA of a fetus, Bove says. Sex chromosomes could also be related, but the answer “is definitely not as easy as ‘estrogen is good or bad,’” she says. (Learn more about why women might be more at risk of developing autoimmune diseases.)  Blood relatives of those with MS are also more likely to develop the disease. This doesn’t mean MS is inherited, but genetic variants associated with it could be. Smoking, obesity and vitamin D deficiency are also associated with MS. Although MS can be diagnosed at any age, it is most often diagnosed in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds. Previously, MS was thought to primarily affect white women. Only in the last 10 or 15 years has the paradigm started to shift, reflecting what scientists know to be true: The disease develops across all racial groups, Bove says. Because of this lingering stereotype of MS, “a lot of people from different genders, races and ethnic backgrounds don't have the knowledge about MS in their communities, and that can be a barrier to getting help,” she says. While some areas of the world have relatively low MS cases, like sub-Saharan Africa, this may be more because of a lack of neurologists than a lack of MS, Bove says. There’s no known cure or way to guarantee you won’t develop MS. For now, limiting risks by quitting smoking, eating healthy and getting enough Vitamin D is the best prevention measure, Gaitán says, but they’re not surefire methods. Researchers have identified blood markers for neuroinflammation, and in the future, tests for these markers could help diagnose MS or detect imminent flare-ups, allowing patients to take medication before symptoms arise. Preventing EBV could also help. Vaccines for EBV are in early stages, and antivirals exist but have not seen much success in clinical testing. Ascherio believes MS cases could decrease significantly if an effective drug against EVB is developed.  For now, medications can treat symptoms and prevent new lesions, but none repair past damage to the nervous system. “That’s the next big thing on the horizon,” Charvet says. Nothing is known to entirely prevent MS, but spreading awareness is an important step to catch the disease early. “Be aware of the disease and know that if you diagnose and treat early, you change the evolution of the disease,” Gaitán says.

18,Priya Raj,6 of the best destinations to celebrate midsummer in Europe,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-celebrate-midsummer-europe,"As the length of the day reaches its maximum, Europe is preparing to mark midsummer. Here are the best places to join in with the revelries.",2024-06-15T00:00:00Z,"As the length of the day reaches its maximum, Europe is preparing to mark midsummer. Here are the best places to join in with the revelries. Marked on or around the longest day of the year — the summer solstice — midsummer is celebrated across Europe, especially in the north. The mystery surrounding the day means it’s difficult to say with certainty why or when these celebrations began, though folklore points towards farming and harvesting traditions to thank the sun for a fruitful year. The celebrations today are still firmly rooted in local lore. Whether you want to commemorate by joining events steeped in tradition or party at a festival with thousands of others, here are some of the best destinations to celebrate midsummer in Europe. Midsummer celebrations are an integral part of Swedish culture and traditions. The origins of the festival in Sweden began by people decorating their homes and dancing around maypoles to celebrate the season of fertility. Today, Swedes flock to the countryside with family and friends. If you don’t have any Swedish friends who can bring you along to the celebrations, Stockholm hosts several public midsummer events for visitors. Families visiting the capital, should head to Skansen open-air museum for folk music, flower and birch wreath making and the central event — the raising of the maypole. Alternatively, take a 75-minute boat trip to Grinda island for celebrations lasting until the early hours. In 2024, Midsummer Eve in Sweden is marked on 21 June. While it might at first seem an unlikely destination to celebrate midsummer, it’s perhaps one of the best to visit for historical relevance. Built around 5,000 years ago, Stonehenge’s standing stones align with the sun on both the summer and winter solstices, making for an ethereal and magical sight.   Though there are no specific activities at Stonehenge on the day, crowds gather in the thousands to see the spectacle of the sun rising behind the Heel Stone right into the heart of the structure, and to witness senior druid King Arthur Pendragon conducting a service at the historical site, as he does on every solstice. This year, the spectacular sunrise arrives on the morning of 21 June. While midsummer isn’t a public holiday in Norway as it is in Sweden and the events aren’t as extravagant as in Sweden, the day is still marked with outdoor parties and bonfires — in fact, Norwegian’s take their fires so seriously, the world’s largest open-air fire was built by the residents of Ålesund in 2016 for midsummer. Typically, an animal effigy is set alight on the fjord waters of Sukkerbiten, and various other public events take place at the Norwegian Folk Museum, including yodeling, wreath making and horse and carriage rides. Midsummer Eve, or Sankthansaften, is celebrated on 23 June. Jāņi, as it’s known locally, is a pagan festival that’s still marked every year. This year, it takes place overnight from 23-24 June. The joyous festivities celebrate nature, with locals making wreaths from oak leaves and wildflowers and lighting bonfires. The mysticism associated with midsummer runs deep in Latvia, with many still believing in a whole host of folk traditions. For example, plants picked on the summer solstice are said to have the power to heal diseases and ward off evil spirits, while bathing in the morning dew is said to bring beauty and youth. The capital city, Riga, offers countless public events throughout the day and night, from a midsummer fair in the Old Town to a free outdoor ball in a park with live music and food. In Spain’s second city and throughout Catalonia, midsummer is celebrated from the evening of June 23 to the following day, as the Feast of Sant Joan. Marking the start of summer, the events revolve around fire, water and herbs — the three symbols of Sant Joan. The city is lit by fireworks and fires lining the streets throughout the night and, as with Latvian traditions, the holistic properties of herbs are said to multiply on this night. The beach is the best place to be during the celebrations — restaurant tables line up across the beachfront, picnics are dotted around the sand and pop-up firework shops throughout the city make sure the night goes off with a bang. Icelandic folklore says the summer solstice blurs the lines between the worlds as we know them — animals can speak and turn human, and a roll about in wet grass can heal diseases. Though there are no promises of a conversation with our four-legged friends, the Summer Solstice Festival in Reykjavík, taking place over 23-25 June, isn’t just a music festival. Expect a breathtaking rave inside a glacier or, for a slightly warmer alternative, a party in geothermal springs. The festival also includes tours to the natural wonders of Iceland, sharing ancient stories along the way.

19,Parissa DJangi,The perfect storm that led to the Jonestown massacre,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/jonestown-massacre-jim-jones-peoples-temple-civil-rights,Jim Jones leveraged upheaval surrounding civil rights and the Vietnam War to earn trust and manipulate his followers.,2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Jim Jones leveraged upheaval surrounding civil rights and the Vietnam War to earn trust and manipulate his followers. The Jonestown massacre remains one of the largest mass murders in American history. In a single day, 901 Americans and 8 Guyanese died from Jim Jones’ actions. Met with criticism rather than compassion, victims and survivors of the 1978 tragedy were often blamed and seen as “crazy” for joining the movement.  The truth is that Jonestown’s leader, preacher Jim Jones, was successful in drawing in followers in the United States because his message resonated in an era of frustration and upheaval—and his views were legitimized by other civil rights leaders. In Guyana, Jones offered a utopia where followers could enact their vision of an equal, self-sufficient society.  (Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown will premiere June 17 on Hulu and August 14 on National Geographic.)  Wildly charismatic, Jones preached what so many Americans longed to hear. Young radicals, disillusioned by establishment politics and the Vietnam War, applauded the socialist principles he promoted at his church, Peoples Temple. Black members were also drawn in, at one point making up 80 to 90 percent of the congregation. Not only did much of Jones’ work take on civil rights issues, he also modeled traditional Black worship styles, touted his adopted Black and Korean children, and even claimed he himself was Black. Considering the months and years that led up to the massacre, it’s clear the folks who joined Jonestown weren’t “crazy” or “cultists.” Instead, they were simply people looking to build a fairer, better world—and Jonestown gave them a way to see their community realized. Jim Jones opened what would become Peoples Temple in Indiana in 1954. The Peoples Temple drew from socialism, communism, and Christianity to promote equality and attract a multi-racial congregation. Jones  proselytized with a showman’s panache and used faith-healing to attract followers. Black Americans made up a significant share of church membership. Peoples Temple’s commitment to racial equality, and its incorporation of Black American religious traditions, meant that it was what scholar Rebecca Moore called “a culturally as well as racially Black movement.”  “The first time that I got there I was greeted by a rainbow coalition of people, and this was the first time I had been in an atmosphere where it’s one church, multiracial and multigenerational as well,” Former Peoples Temple member Yulanda Williams remembers. “When I heard Jim Jones, he spoke about how much he respected the civil rights movement and how important it was that we continued to live out Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream.” Jones’s charisma and vision attracted the attention of some of the country’s most visible activists, including actor Jane Fonda and Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther movement. Jones also won the support of the political establishment in San FranciscoCalifornia, where he moved his church in 1965. There, he met Rosalynn Carter, wife of President Jimmy Carter, who was so enthralled with Jones she went on to speak from his pulpit.; the two also had dinner together and exchanged letters.  Harvey Milk fawned over Jones’s work, and politicians courting voters often turned up at Peoples Temple. After a series of reports debunked Jones’ faith healing and accused him of abuse, Jones started believing these were signs that America was out to get Peoples Temple––and him. Drug use only fueled his paranoia that the U.S. government would target the church or turn fascist. These fears convinced Jones and other church leaders that the future of their movement lay outside America’s borders. In 1974, Peoples Temple acquired land in the jungle of Guyana. Since A conveniently English speaking country, Guyana also’s population included a mixture of people of African, Asian, and Amerindian descent, and Jones believed it would be perfect for a multiracial utopia. The church planned to construct an agricultural commune where members could live out their values. A big wave of Peoples Temple members, including Jim Jones, came in the summer of 1977. As Rebecca Moore wrote in her book Understanding Jonestown and Peoples Temple, these “members believed they were not just deserting something worse but also moving to something better. They set the goal of creating a community without racism, in which all children would be free and equal.”   By November 1978, Jonestown’s population had swelled to 1,020. Moore estimated that Jonestown’s largest demographic group were Black women and girls, who made up 45 percent of the population. Black members made up 68 percent of Jonestown’s total population. The commune was also predominately youthful, with 63 percent of the population 35 or younger, and 152 children under the age of 12. Everyone played a role. Residents acted as cooks, carpenters, and engineers. Teachers delivered student-centered instruction to children, teaching subjects like math, reading, and Guyanese history. Older students participated in apprenticeship programs in the community. The compound had a generator, dormitory-style cabins, and a communal kitchen. Residents also had access to a library and health center. An audio system enabled Jones to make frequent announcements through a loudspeaker, so his voice was ever present.  In addition to the mandatory meetings every night, residents participated in different activities, including sports teams, dance and musical arts groups, and movie nights. Some initially enjoyed their time in Jonestown. “They were bringing in electricity, building beautiful homes where we wouldn’t have to pay rent, all the food we needed, our medical would all be taken care of,” Williams remembers. “It was something that was absolutely amazing. We were safe and secure. A great utopia, the better life, helping each other as one, big, happy family.”  Still, Jonestown wasn’t the utopia Jim Jones had promised. Grace Stoen left Peoples Temple before the building of Jonestown, but she still learned of what was happening there. “I started hearing that people were being badly mistreated. […] Jim was making their lives a complete misery, bullying and controlling them.”  The man who preached the gospel of equality anointed himself ruler of his kingdom in the jungle. He hoarded everyone’s passports, preventing them from leaving. Residents couldn’t date or break up without his approval. Punishments included social ostracism, and according to witnesses, he bound children in the forest and wrapped a snake around a woman’s leg. Jones’s paranoia worsened, and he was convinced that soldiers would storm Jonestown. Insisting mass suicide was the only way out, he gathered residents and told them to drink what he said was poison—it wasn’t; it was a test to prove their loyalty, and to prepare them for what was to come. Jonestown residents went along with it because they had performed these suicide drills in California, and these The drills may have desensitized Jonestown residents them to what Moore called a “ritualized” ceremony. On November 18, 1978, Jones directed the people of Jonestown to act out what they had rehearsed. After a visit from U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan, Jones decided the end times had come. He compelled his congregation to consume a cyanide cocktail. Some may have willingly taken it, but many were likely coerced into the act, perhaps fearing that they would be killed if they refused. Others, including children, were forced to drink it, or it was injected into their bloodstream with syringes. When the commune fell silent, over 900 men, women, and children were dead.

Here’s what you need to get the most our your vehicle, from sleeping to cooking to hygiene.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"It’s convenient, accessible, and allows you more flexibility than tent camping. Here’s what you need to get the most our your vehicle, from sleeping to cooking to hygiene. There are a thousand and one ways to enjoy the great outdoors—and not all of them involve a six-person tent. Many people (present company included) are taking advantage of the mobile accommodation currently parked in their driveway, i.e., car camping. Unlike a traditional tent-and-pole campsite, camping à la automobile is more convenient, great for last-minute adventures, and allows you to pack as heavy or as light as you'd like. While you could, in theory, hit the road with nothing but a toothbrush and a case for wanderlust, I've found that there are a few specialty items that make sleeping on the road a little more comfortable. I’ve been on my fair share of car camping trips, including a 5-week jaunt around the U.S in a tiny Honda Civic, to National Park-centric road trips during which I car camped the entire time. I’ve spent plenty of time packing and unpacking my vehicle, folding down the seats, and setting up a makeshift bed and kitchen in the back. Here are some car camping essentials I recommend. Just like moving into a new home, temporarily living in your vehicle requires a few basics. I've broken down those essentials into seven categories: sleep, kitchen, maintenance, safety, hygiene, entertainment, and other miscellaneous camping gear. (Get ready to hit the road with these road trip essentials) Buy it now at Tuff Stuff Overland Many car campers choose to snooze within the confines of their four-door. But if you want more of a sleep-underneath-the-stars experience, this two-person rooftop tent is the next best thing. It's just like any high-quality tent you'd stake into the ground—waterproof material, multiple mosquito net windows, and a built-in shoe bag—only it mounts to your car's roof rack and can only be accessed via a ladder. Buy it now on Amazon Sleeping on top of your folded-down backseat will result in a symphony of aching muscles come morning time. Beat the back pain with this two-person cushioned air mattress designed specifically to fit in an SUV. It only takes 10 minutes to inflate and comes with two pillows for extra coziness. Buy it now on Amazon If you're a solo traveler like me, a compact sleeping pad will maximize space. I've used this one while car camping in national parks like the Badlands, the Smoky Mountains, and Zion and was happily surprised by how thick and cushioned it was. It's also affordable, comes with a built-in pillow, and is super easy to inflate—no air pump or mouth-blowing required. (The best camping gear, according to National Geographic staff) Buy it now on Amazon Whether you're trying to shield yourself from morning light or nosy fellow travelers, window covers are something you don't think you need until you don't have them. These polyester and spandex ones work with most cars, are easy to install, and help keep your vehicle ventilated. Plus, you can still roll and raise your windows while they're on, so if you want a nighttime breeze in the car, but don’t want to let in mosquitoes, these covers do the trick. Buy it now on Amazon No mobile bedroom is complete without a dedicated covering. This flannel option is cozy and versatile, with the ability to zip up into a one-person sleeping bag or unzip into a large quilt. You can even zip two bags together to form a double-person sleeping bag. Buy it now on Amazon Storing all the sandwiches, snacks, and beverages your heart desires is a non-issue thanks to this 30-quart cooler. It can work as both a mobile refrigerator to keep your food fresh or as a freezer to preserve any perishables for longer trips.

Buy it now on Amazon You're probably not whipping up five-course meals on the road, but having a portable stove handy is always a good idea. This portable kit comes with everything you need—a mini stove, two non-stick pots, a spoon, a fork, a knife, a 16-ounce cup, and a carrying bag—to make a simple yet satisfying meal. Plus, it can all be folded together to save space.

Though it's only 5 pounds and folds down flat, it has adjustable height options and can hold up to 77 pounds of weight. There are other sizes and heights available, but I found this 2-foot one to be the most versatile during my 5-week road trip from Pennsylvania to California and back. Buy it now on Amazon This collapsible water container is a much more efficient use of space (not to mention better for the environment) than lugging around multiple single-use bottles. It can hold up to 5.3 gallons of H2O, depending on what size you get, and comes with a spigot for easy pouring. The fact that it's BPA-free and folds up flat for easy storage is just a bonus. Buy it now on Amazon There are some luxuries we can't live without—and freshly brewed coffee is one of them. This cordless (yep, you read that right) coffee maker takes up minimal space and can be charged with your car battery.  It can make up to three 5-ounce cups of coffee per charge and works with both single-serve packs and grounds. Buy it now on Amazon While you'll hopefully never have to use it, investing in a fully loaded roadside emergency kit is a must for any car camper. This one includes a whopping 124 essentials, such as jumper cables, repair tools, a survival whistle, and gloves. There's even a handy shovel that can be used for anything from digging out tires from snow and mud to breaking glass.

This compact jump starter can jump-start up to 4-liter gasoline engines in seconds and can be recharged with any USB port within three hours.

Buy it now on Amazon You never want to be without some basic medical supplies when you're on the open road. Johnson & Johnson's All-Purpose First Aid Kit comes with 160 essentials to help with everything from minor cuts and headaches to burns and sprains. The small size and compact carrying case make it easy to throw in your glove compartment, and it's refillable for future trips. Buy it now on Amazon While some road kits come with flashlights, it's a good idea to grab one with a little more power. This battery-powered S1000 LED flashlight may be small, but its zoomable beam can reach a lot farther than you'd expect. It also has five different modes, is water-resistant, and can survive drops from as high as 10 feet. Buy it now at REI Beyond the obvious reasons for self-defense, having a pocket knife on hand can be useful for all the unexpected tasks you can encounter on a road trip. This multi-tool from Leatherman is a popular choice because it has not only a 2.6-inch blade but also a screwdriver, a bottle opener, pliers, and a wire cutter. I love how small and lightweight it is, too. (Everyone needs a multi-tool. Here are 10 we love) Buy it now on Amazon If you're cautious of leaving out food and considerate of wildlife, your chances of a real-life grizzly encounter are slim. But it's always better to be safe than sorry. So grab a can of this SABRE Frontiersman deterrent and sleep peacefully, knowing that it has a range of 30 feet and a holster for even quicker access.

Its 15-inch blade is plenty big enough to take on fallen branches and saplings, and the fact that it folds up to only 17 inches in length means it'll fit nicely in a car trunk. Buy it now on Amazon I can't stress enough how important it is to have a good bug spray. This CDC-recommended one from Murphy's Naturals uses lemon eucalyptus oil as its active ingredient to repel mosquitos for up to six hours and deer ticks for up to four.

21,Rachel Fairbank,Is decaf really healthier than regular coffee? Here’s how they compare.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/decaf-coffee-health-benefits,"Coffee beans are full of antioxidants that benefit that heart and brain, but the decaffeination process can alter these helpful compounds.",2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"Coffee beans are full of antioxidants that benefit that heart and brain, but the decaffeination process can alter these helpful compounds. Coffee may be one of the world’s most popular beverages but people are increasingly turning to decaf out of concern for their health. Surveys show that 26 million Americans report drinking decaf coffee on a regular basis, whether it’s due to concerns over high blood pressure, a desire to limit caffeine later in the day, to avoid sleep disruptions, or due to caffeine sensitivities.   Whatever a person’s reasons for switching may be, “decaf is becoming more and more popular,” says Lauren Ball, a professor of community health and well-being at the University of Queensland, in Brisbane, Australia.  But regular coffee has health benefits in its own right—including a reduced risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, a reduced risk of developing neurological conditions, such as dementia, and a reduced risk of death. Meanwhile, there are rising health concerns about one particular method of removing caffeine from coffee beans, as it uses a harmful chemical called methylene chloride. (Read more about the debate over methylene chloride here.) So what are the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee—and how do these health benefits compare to regular, caffeinated coffee? The good news is that many of coffee’s health benefits are still found in decaffeinated coffee, says Luis Rustveld, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, Texas. As Rustveld notes, coffee contains a number of beneficial compounds, many of which remain even after removing the caffeine. The reason for this is thought to be due to the levels of antioxidants in coffee beans, many of which remain even after the caffeine has been removed. “There are different ways the caffeine is removed, but overall, looking at the chemical compounds in the coffee beans itself, it seems that there are still some protective benefits,” says Dolores Wood, a registered dietitian at The University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health, in Houston, Texas.   Depending on how the caffeine is removed from the coffee beans, this can reduce the amounts of antioxidants compared to regular coffee, but overall, the levels are still high, with coffee representing a significant source of dietary antioxidants for many people.  (Four common methods for making decaf—and how their health benefits compare.) That can translate to real benefits for decaf drinkers. In a 2014 meta-analysis of 28 different studies, researchers found that both decaf and regular coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The more coffee a person reported drinking in a day, the lower their risk for developing the disease.    However, there are some subtle differences in the benefits of decaf and regular coffee. But it’s difficult to parse out whether the effects found in these studies are due to the lack of caffeine in decaf; the changes made to coffee as a result of removing the caffeine; or the lower numbers of decaf drinkers. In a 2022 study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers tracked the health outcomes of 449,563 participants over 12.5 years, looking at the rate of cardiovascular disease in coffee drinkers versus non-coffee drinkers. They found a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death in all coffee drinkers, which included people who drank decaf. The one major difference researchers found was that decaffeinated coffee was not associated with a reduction in arrythmias. This may be due to caffeine having a stabilizing effect on the heart’s rhythm, by blocking adenosine receptors, says Peter Kistler, a cardiologist at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute at The Alfred, a hospital in Melbourne, Australia.   As a result, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology issued a recommendation that physicians should stop telling patients to stop drinking coffee—which they had long done due to concerns that it was linked to atrial fibrillation.  Caffeine can also help alleviate migraines, with research showing that for people who experience episodic migraines, regular caffeine consumption can decrease the frequency of their migraines. Research also suggests that caffeine can help augment the effects of migraine medication, making it more effective. For other people, caffeine can trigger headaches, or make them worse. (You can consume too much caffeine. Here are the risks.) But that doesn’t mean more caffeine is the answer, says Ina Bergheim, a nutritional researcher at the University of Vienna. “If caffeine were the only reason why coffee was beneficial, we would probably see similar effects from soft drinks,” Bergheim says.   The current FDA recommendation is to not exceed 400 milligrams per day, with one eight-ounce cup of coffee containing between 80 to 100 milligrams. The effects of caffeine can vary, with some people being much more sensitive. In the short-term, consuming too much caffeine can cause jitteriness, sleep disruptions, gastrointestinal discomfort, headaches, or a racing heart. Long-term, consuming too much caffeine can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, if a person tries to stop. One of the reasons that the health benefits of coffee have been debated for so long is due to the fact that its consumption can often go hand-in-hand with other habits, some of which can make parsing out the true cause and effect very difficult. “There are no perfect studies on this,” Bergheim says. Instead, researchers have had to parse out the cause and effect of coffee consumption by tracking the habits and health outcomes of a lot of people, which introduces a risk of conflating factors that are correlated, but not causative.  For example, in a major study that tracked the coffee consumption habits of over 200,000 health workers, researchers found coffee drinking was associated with a higher rate of smoking cigarettes—and that the health risks they faced such as lung cancer were due to smoking rather than coffee. The same can be true of other habits that go hand-in-hand with drinking coffee, such as adding in a lot of sugar. As another study found, regular coffee consumption is associated with a reduced amount of weight gain over time, but only if drinkers had their coffee black or with cream, but no sugar. This held true whether people were drinking regular or decaf coffee. “Having unsweetened coffee seems to be the way to go, whether or not it’s decaf or regular,” Ball says.  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

Trastevere has something to offer culinary-minded visitors at every hour of the day, from little shops selling artisanal salumi to classic trattorias. Literally meaning ‘the other side of the Tevere (Tiber River)’, Trastevere is one of the most historic neighbourhoods of Rome. It used to be a working-class district, and although much has changed since those times, plenty of its charm has remained: the tight alleys with fascinating angles, laundry hanging from building to building, old men playing cards in the bars, the smell of tomato sauce wafting from homes and trattorias alike. Its streets abound with historical sights such as churches and palazzos to explore. And at night, you can find the same streets buzzing with huge crowds of young people out for a drink and a bite in one of Trastevere’s many bars, or in its extraordinary piazzas. Here are a few of the best places to eat while in Trastevere. Near the characterful San Cosimato market, this family-run deli shop has just turned a century old and is still where locals do their shopping. The market itself is well worth a visit, while this old-school deli — with all the retro vibes of a corner shop from the movies — is the perfect spot for a snack or a light lunch. It has a large variety of salami, hams and other types of cured meat, as well as cheeses and a very good porchetta (pork roast), which you can have in the form of a panino, if you want, with the addition of mozzarella. It’s traditional to have fritti (a variety of deep-fried bites) before a pizza in Rome and Naples. The classic Roman fritti are deep-fried courgette flowers (fiori di zucca) stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies; deep-fried cod fillet (filetto di baccalà); and supplì, little rice balls dressed with tomato sauce and stuffed with mozzarella, then breaded and fried. Some compare supplì to Sicilian arancini, but they’re supposed to be different, both in size and in condiment. Supplì Roma in Via di San Francesco a Ripa has gained fame for making its supplì using other traditional Roman recipes such as cacio e pepe, aubergine parmigiana and even non-traditional options such as pulled pork — the latter two are especially popular. Many locals have these supplì for a workday lunch. There’s a Roman tradition of pizza al taglio that is quite unmatched in the rest of Italy. Literally meaning pizza by the slice, pizza al taglio is made in large trays, topped with a variety of ingredients that can be quite far from the classic round pizza flavours, and is sold in the quantity you want — so it’s a perfect solution for a little snack, a light lunch or feeding a big crowd at a party. Alice Pizza, born 35 years ago in Rome, is famous for its light and highly digestible pizza dough, which manages to retain its quality across branches throughout the country. Alice’s toppings, however, are locally provided, which means the pizzas in different cities are not quite the same. Go for the classic potato and the amatriciana if they’re available. This one of Rome's oldest and most classic trattorias, run by generations of trasteverini who have been making the same dishes for more than 70 years. It’s a trusted institution run by generations of trasteverini. They make tonnarelli (a fresh pasta not unlike spaghetti) in house and serve it with amatriciana, carbonara, gricia or cacio e pepe — all the Roman classics to try. Another standout menu option at Taverna 51 is the tonnarelli with mussels and pecorino — an unlikely but very interesting combination. For the main, the meatballs (polpette) and saltimbocca alla romana (veal with ham and sage cooked in wine), are highly recommended choices. For over 25 years, this small gelateria has been a source of refreshment on cobbled Via della Lungaretta. The pleasantly surprising element about Fiordiluna is its attention to the ingredients; not only does it source them from fair-trade and local producers — many of which are organic — it also takes particular care to use as few ingredients as possible for each gelato flavour. You can also find sugar-free gelato that’s truly indistinguishable from the conventional kind.

23,Jamie Davis Smith,The best mosquito repellents for 2024,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-mosquito-repellents,Forget the citronella. These repellents have ingredients that are known to be effective.,2024-06-11T00:00:00Z,"Forget the citronella. These repellents have ingredients that are known to be effective. Mosquitos are small but formidable creatures. In addition to causing itching, mosquito bites can transmit diseases like malaria, West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya, according to Richard J. Pollack, Ph.D., senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University.  Pollack explains that choosing the right mosquito repellent depends on the person and the circumstances. However, “a good repellent can dramatically reduce the number of bites a person receives,” he says. That “will not only reduce how often we’ll suffer itching from the bites, but it should also reduce the chance that we’ll become infected by the pathogens the mosquito might pass onto us,” Pollack says.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to selecting a mosquito repellent. However, we chose Deep Woods Off as our best mosquito repellent overall because it has long-lasting protection, ingredients proven to repel mosquitos, and a nonsticky formula most people will be able to tolerate.  (You really are a mosquito magnet. Here's what they're drawn to—and what you can do about it.) Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: Deep Woods Off is our best overall mosquito repellent. This mosquito repellent will work well for most people in most situations. It contains 25 percent DEET, which Amy Duckro, DO, infectious diseases physician with Kaiser Permanente, says is proven to repel mosquitos. The aerosol spray bottle also makes it easy to apply the repellent evenly and completely.  (How much DEET do you need? Here's what the EPA recommends.) Deep Woods Off also has a dry-to-the-touch formula that should help prevent hands and clothing from getting sticky. Plus, its long-lasting formula means you can go longer between applications. That increases the chances you will stay protected.  Keep in mind: Some users don’t like the smell of Deep Woods Off. Product details: Form: Aerosol Spray | Active Ingredients: DEET Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: Cutter Backwoods Dry is our choice for the best mosquito repellent with DEET. It’s sweat-resistant, lasts for up to 10 hours, and feels dry to the touch. Cutter Backwoods Dry also comes in a smaller bottle that's easier to pack and carry. This is also a good choice for a mosquito repellent that is effective against other insects, including ticks, gnats, fleas, and biting flies. Bites from these insects can also cause itching and disease. Choosing the best mosquito and insect repellent that works well against these critters means fewer products to worry about to try to stay healthy.  Keep in mind: Like some of our other picks, some users complain about the smell. However, since scent is largely a matter of personal preference, this won’t bother everyone. Additionally, some people don’t like the smaller-sized containers, but that is a bonus for those who like to cut down on weight in their bags.  Product details: Form: Aerosol Spray | Active Ingredient: 25% DEET  Buy it now at Amazon Why we like it: Sawyer Products Picaridin Insect Repellent is our choice for the best mosquito and insect repellent without DEET. The active ingredient in this mosquito repellent is picaridin. Duckro explains that, like DEET, picaridin is known to be effective against mosquitos.  However, “unlike DEET, picaridin has a pleasant smell and does not dissolve plastic materials,” she says. Sawyer Products Picaridin Insect Repellent says it repels mosquitoes for up to 12 hours and lasts longer than many other repellents. It also dries quickly and is safe to use on clothing. That makes this mosquito repellent easier to use.  Keep in mind: Some users say that cans of this repellent run out more quickly than similar products. However, how long a can will last depends largely on how it is used.  Product details: Form: Aerosol Spray| Active Ingredient: 20% picaridin  Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: Our choice for the best natural mosquito repellent is Repel Plant-Based Mosquito Repellent. The active ingredient in this mosquito repellent is oil of lemon eucalyptus, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found is safe and effective, only when specifically formulated for an insect repellent. Keep in mind that the CDC does not recommend using “pure” oil of lemon eucalyptus. It’s a great alternative for those who want to avoid DEET and picaridin but want to use a mosquito repellent with proven results.  Oil of lemon eucalyptus may be less irritating to some people than those that contain harsh ingredients. Keep in mind: It may take more time and effort to get complete coverage with a spray bottle, but this may be worth the trade-off for those who want to avoid aerosol sprays or products containing DEET and picaridin.  Product details: Form: Spray | Active Ingredients: oil of lemon eucalyptus Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: The best outdoor mosquito repellent system is the Thermacell Mosquito Repellent Rechargeable Adventure EX-Series EX90. It’s a battery-powered machine with a refillable reservoir of liquid mosquito repellent. All you have to do is press the machine’s “On” button, and it will heat up the repellent, dispersing it through the air. This model should create a 20-foot barrier of mosquito repellent from wherever you decide to put it, within 15 minutes. This mosquito repellent device is a great alternative for those who can’t, or prefer not to, use repellent directly on the skin. We like this model for its portability so you can take it on camping and road trips.  Keep in mind: The battery lasts for up to nine hours, but will eventually need to be recharged. Also keep in mind that this is a scent-free mosquito repellent.  Product details: Form: Battery Powered Mosquito Repellent | Active Ingredients: Metofluthrin | Sustainability: Battery is rechargeable  Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: Our choice for best spray-on mosquito repellent is Ranger Ready Picaridin Insect Repellent Spray. This spray has a quick-dry, nonsticky formula. It also comes in a variety of scents in addition to a scent-free version. That makes this mosquito repellent a great choice for those who don’t like the smell of standard repellents.  Because this option comes in a spray bottle, it’s easier to keep the spray out of your eyes and apply only where needed. This repellent is also available in a variety of sizes, so it’s easy to find the one that meets your needs. Whether you need a small bottle to pack in carry-on luggage or a large bottle to pack for a few weeks away, you should be able to find an option that works for you.  Keep in mind: Some users have complained that the bottle leaks. Product details: Form: Spray | Ingredients: 20% picaridin | Sustainability: Bottles can be recycled  Buy it now at Avon Why we like it: Our choice for the best mosquito repellent for kids is Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition. This mosquito repellent is combined with sun protection.  It can be hard to get kids to stay still, so using a product that combines mosquito repellent and SPF may make it easier to keep kids safe outdoors.  This mosquito repellent is hypoallergenic and contains Vitamin E, so it may be more gentle for some children’s skin. Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition is also available as an aerosol spray or pump, making it easier to find an option that works for all children.  Keep in mind: Avon Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition might help repel mosquitoes for up to eight hours. However, SPF typically needs to be applied more frequently.  Product details: Form: Aerosol Spray or Pump | Active Ingredient: IR3535  Buy it now on Amazon Why we like it: Sawyer Premium Insect Repellent is our choice for the best mosquito repellent lotion. The lotion is odorless and dries quickly, making it easier to use. And because the lotion needs to be rubbed in, it’s easier to ensure you don’t miss a spot with lotion than with clear sprays.  Sawyer Premium Insect Repellent lotion repels mosquitoes for up to 14 hours—that’s longer-lasting protection than most of our other choices. The lotion container is also small and light, making it easy to pack.  Keep in mind: Unlike sprays, lotion cannot be applied on clothing or gear. However, for some people, this will be sufficient. A similar formulation is available as a pump or spray, but protection does not last as long.  Product details: Form: Lotion | Ingredients: 20% picaridin I drew heavily on my own experience using mosquito repellents. I live in Washington, D.C., where mosquitoes are common throughout the summer. I also enjoy hiking and have traveled extensively through malarial areas. Mosquitoes seem to flock to me, and I've tried many different repellents to keep them away. Additionally, I studied brand product descriptions, third-party reviews, and competitor articles, considering the following:       There are several factors to consider when selecting a mosquito repellent. Pollack emphasizes that no matter which type of mosquito repellent you use, “to use such products effectively and safely, each person should read, understand, and follow the instructions on the product.” Select only repellents that are registered by the Environmental Protection Agency According to Pollack, “products formulated with DEET, picaridin, or pyrethroids have good track records as effective and low-risk repellents.” Other ingredients, such as oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535, have also been shown to be effective. Pollack warns that although alternative products exist, “they tend to be relatively ineffective or may actually pose unjustifiable risks.”   Look for the right concentration of active ingredients  Once you have identified a product with an effective active ingredient, it’s important to make sure the product contains the right amount to be safe and effective. Duckro recommends looking for an insect repellent with 25-40 percent DEET or 20 percent picaridin. “These ingredients have the most data supporting their effectiveness,” she said.  Avoid untested ingredients and methods  Many commonly used repellents include citronella, cedar, or peppermint. However, “these natural insect repellents have not been evaluated by the EPA for effectiveness,” Duckro says. Pollack adds that consumers should be “highly skeptical regarding the supposed value of sound devices.” Both Pollack and Duckro recommend sticking with mosquito repellents that have a proven track record of working.   Select the right mosquito repellent for the right circumstances  When selecting a mosquito repellent, consider how it will be used. “A product with a lower concentration of the repellent substance may be suitable for low-risk situations, such as while outside for just an hour or so” in an area that does not have a high incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, Pollack says. However, “a product formulated with a higher concentration of repellent, or a time-release formulation, may be more suitable” for someone spending more time outdoors or in high-risk areas, he says.        Duckro recommends using an insect repellent that contains 25-40% DEET or 20% picaridin. Pollack stresses that to be effective, all mosquito repellents have to be used according to the instructions on the label.  Pollack says that most mosquito biologists use mosquito repellents with a track record of effectiveness. They also “cover up skin with clothing to reduce opportunities for mosquitoes to find exposed skin” and avoid mosquitos when possible, he says. This could include staying indoors or avoiding areas with standing water where mosquitoes breed.  Duckro also stays alert to the risks in the area she is visiting so that she plans accordingly. Some mosquitoes, such as those that transmit malaria and West Nile virus, are “active at dusk and dawn,” but those that transmit Zika and dengue virus “bite during the day,” she says.  Many products using citronella, cedar, or peppermint claim that mosquitoes are repelled by these smells. “However, these natural insect repellents have not been evaluated by the EPA for effectiveness,” and there is no evidence that mosquitos hate these smells, Duckro says. She adds that “scented soaps or perfumes may attract mosquitoes.”  According to Duckro, “When using a spray, spray the repellent on the hands first, and then apply it to the face rather than spraying the repellent directly onto the face. Avoid getting insect repellents near the mouth and eyes.”  As a precaution, “it’s best to apply an insect repellent for a child instead of letting them apply the product because kids often put their hands in their mouths,” she adds. Read the product label to understand “how water, sweat, and temperatures affect the product you are using, and reapply the repellents according to the product label,” Duckro says.  “Some sunscreens are less effective when combined with DEET,” Duckro says, “and sunscreens increase the skin absorption of DEET, which may increase the risk of toxicity, particularly in kids.” When using sunscreen and insect repellents, “sunscreen should be applied first and allowed to fully dry before applying an insect repellent,” she says.   Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

24,Berkok Yüksel,Is this small Baltic city the arts and culture capital of 2024?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/tartu-estonia-guide-arts-culture-capital,"Estonia’s second city is coming into its own as more than 1,000 arts and culture projects take over as part of its European Capital of Culture 2024 programme — here’s how to plan a visit.",2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Estonia’s second city is coming into its own as more than 1,000 arts and culture projects take over as part of its European Capital of Culture 2024 programme — here’s how to plan a visit. The Kissing Students statue in Tartu is many things — a symbol of the city, a gathering point and the inspiration of Kissing Tartu, a one-day festival comprising art, musical performances and a mass kissing event. And while it seems like it could be the highlight of the year in this small Baltic city, Tartu is worth a visit year-round as it takes up its mantle as a European Capital of Culture for 2024. Standing in front of Tartu Town Hall, the Kissing Students statue is the main meeting point in Raekoja plats, the city’s central square. The cobblestoned plaza, encircled by cafes, cocktail bars, boutique shops and even a tattoo parlour, takes on various roles over the seasons — an ice rink in winter, an open-air cinema in summer and an ideal starting point to explore the city year-round. Here you’ll also find the Kunstimuuseum (Tartu Art Museum), affectionately known as ‘the leaning house’; the 18th-century mansion was built atop a previous medieval structure, on unstable soil. Expect local art exhibits, including the current exhibition on 1980s Estonian caricature, which promises some light-hearted laughs until late July. Dive into one of the narrow lanes, the Rüütli Street, and you’ll find people coming to eat and drink al fresco when the weather is fine. Here, the underground Gambrinus beer shop provides a vast selection of craft beer from Estonia and beyond — perfect for stocking up for a picnic in the nearby Botanical Gardens. Wandering among the blooming flowers and relaxing in the pergola by the pond is an essential Tartu experience, giving visitors a taste of the calm and easygoing nature of the city. Walk north from the main square and you’ll come across the 14th-century St John’s Church, famous for its copper-coloured brick exterior and human figurines adorning its façades. Although the reasons for creating them remain unknown, the handmade terracotta busts are believed to represent past residents of Tartu, who were a part of the church’s congregation. Five minutes north west of the Town Hall Square is the impressive main building of the University of Tartu. A shrine to education and architectural symmetry, the grey neoclassical building has six large Ionic columns carrying a triangular pediment, making the façade unique in the city in its grandeur. The university, founded in 1632 by King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden (then-ruler of Estonia), was the first step in shaping Tartu into an intellectual and cultural hub. To this day, the presence of the university is prominent in the city, as many residents are connected to the institution in some way and many migrate here for academic reasons. Towards the other side of Tartu, behind the university’s library building, is a cultural centre that houses a special spot — a quirky record store called Psühhoteek, run by ‘vinyl whisperer’ Ahto Külvet. Here, you can flip through rare Soviet-era records and niche, once-contraband American albums with fake covers to allow them to be distributed in Soviet Russia, while listening to Ahto’s fascinating tales of musical treasure hunting. One of Tartu’s most intriguing areas is the Karlova neighbourhood. Towards the south of the city, this area is famous for its historic wooden houses, often with art nouveau details, many dating back to the early 20th century. Now inhabited by young creatives and an alternative crowd with a strong sense of community, Karlova has become the city’s bohemian quarter. Start your morning with a well-brewed coffee at Karlova Kohv and come back in the evening for a drink at Barlova, a locals’ favourite run by a hardcore Juventus fan. On weekend nights, expect a DJ set and Tartuvians gently reaching over each other to pick up their beers from the bar. It’d be a shame to come to Tartu and omit the Estonian National Museum from your itinerary. Proof of the city’s artistic identity, the museum has transformed the former site of a Soviet-era military airfield runway into a cultural space. The permanent exhibition on Estonia’s history, from medieval times to the modern day, is well-curated and exhilaratingly interactive. Visitors can digitally flip through books from the 16th century, explore traditional storytelling with motion-sensing animations and save video components on the chip in their ticket and access them later via a QR code. Throughout the year, the museum will be hosting various events as part of the European Capital of Culture activities, such as the ongoing exhibition on the works of the lesser-known Prague school of surrealists and Estonia’s own surreal artists, running until September. But perhaps Tartu’s most precious asset is its access to the wider southern region of Estonia. Only 25 miles away from the city, a constellation of villages along the shores of Lake Peipus make up the Onion Route cultural trail, named after the bulbous onions grown in the region’s rich soil. Here, local communities preserve traditions and share their culture by offering farm visits, and there are cultural museums, workshops and photo opportunities of countless onions at every corner. An important spot on the trail is the Kolkja Museum of Old Believers, where you can learn about the Old Believers, a unique local community who escaped Russian religious persecution in the 17th century. On top of displaying historic artefacts from the community, the museum allows guests to observe a virtual reality simulation of an Old Believers’ Orthodox church service, a ritual outsiders are usually not allowed to attend. For a wholesome family outing, visit the Peipsimaa Heritage Centre, an old farmhouse on the Onion Route now serving as a museum of textiles and chicory farming. Kids can enjoy treasure hunts or join print-making workshops to create their own textile prints, while adults get absorbed in designing indigo-coloured tote bags. Make sure to conclude the experience with homemade pastries and a warming cup of chicory coffee, a dark-brown brew rich in treacly flavours and with a smooth texture. Throughout the year, visitors can benefit from the city’s vicinity to lakes and forests by kayaking, hiking and camping in the wilderness. For extreme adventure seekers, plan a trip around Kallaste Karakatitsa, a Mad Max-style car race held every year in February on the frozen Lake Peipus. For a more calming time, an alternative is to enjoy the great outdoors through a dip in a cold pond after a smoke sauna session. It’s just like a regular sauna, but the room is first filled with the smoke of burned leaves and then cleared, leaving behind soot and a smoky smell, supposedly amplifying the health benefits of the experience. It’s easy to spot postcard-worthy panoramas in the region, as huge National Geographic-inspired yellow frames are sprinkled across scenic locations. One of 28 such frames is placed near Alatskivi Castle, a 19th-century cream-white manor with pointy turrets, open to the public for visits and events. The manor gardens stretch wide, even including a disc golf course — this is a popular sport in Estonia, where players throw a frisbee disc to far-away baskets. Be sure to stop by Alatskivi Mõisamaitsed, a local shop on the grounds serving various homemade berry wines — you’ll want to try the rhubarb and strawberry. 1. Wild BitsWild Bits is a series of technological art installations and projects spread across southern Estonia’s farms, forests and meadows. Visitors can interact with the ‘techno art’ in the fields, such as exploring lake biodiversity from a rowboat or listening to a radio that changes tunes based on the direction and strength of the wind. Until 15 September, tickets £8.50. 2. Peipsi Food Street 175kmThe Peipsi Toidu Tänav is a two-day pop-up event where restaurants, food producers and local chefs will dot a strip of 175km (109 miles) along Lake Peipus to serve hungry visitors. Traditional Estonian food will be the mainstay of the event alongside more innovative dishes, as well as workshops with local chefs. 17–18 August, free to attend. 3. Paganlik Pärimusöö, Pagan folklore nightOld pagan traditions take the form of theatrical plays, dances and forest exhibitions in this summer folklore evening. Join hundreds of Estonian dancers later in the night as the show turns into a party. 24 August, tickets from £8. 4. Ryoji Ikeda ExhibitionFamous scientist-cum-music artist Ryoji Ikeda, whose CERN-inspired art project won international awards in 2015, will be staging a solo exhibition at the Estonian National Museum. This will feature audiovisual installations made with scientific data, in collaboration with the Estonian Genomics Foundation and Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir. 2 November 2024–2 March 2025, tickets from £4.

25,Nevin Martell,Interested in foraging? Here are 6 places to start.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/best-places-foraging-tours-summer,"Foraging helps travelers connect with nature—and discover surprisingly delicious, locally sourced foods.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Foraging helps travelers connect with nature—and discover surprisingly delicious, locally sourced foods. To get a taste of your destination on your next trip, you could book a table at a locavore restaurant. Or you could go foraging for wild foods. Whether you’re hunting for mushrooms in Sweden’s forests or harvesting leek-like wild ramps in America’s mid-Atlantic region, such experiences reveal a territory’s unique climate, topography, and soil.  “It gives you a deeper understanding of a place by understanding its flavors—from wild blueberries in Maine to porcini mushrooms in the Rocky Mountains,” says Ellen Zachos, an expert forager and the author of How to Forage for Wild Foods Without Dying. Some wild foods can be lethal, trigger long-term health issues, or cause severe gastric distress, so travelers should book experiences with professional foragers to be safe. When tasting any new ingredient, only eat a small portion to ensure it agrees with you, since even non-toxic foods may cause internal discomfort. Here are six ways to get your hands dirty—and fill your belly—on foraging tours across the United States. “The reputation of foragers is that we’re secretive, but that’s not the case,” says Alan Muskat, who leads guests on seasonal hunts to harvest mushrooms, berries, nuts, greens, ramps, and persimmons in and around Asheville, North Carolina. The discovered ingredients are then delivered to a local restaurant and cooked into a bespoke “forest to table” meal. This might mean brown butter seared mushrooms over congee at Tastee Diner or a punchy salad of chickweed and dandelion greens at the Bull & Beggar.  Most people walking through Philadelphia’s public parks and community gardens don’t understand the potential health benefits of the plants surrounding them. On her small group tours, master herbalist Lady Danni Morinich identifies native plants with reputed wellness benefits. Depending on the time of year, she may find dead nettle, which can be brewed into a tea to treat allergies, or mock strawberries, which can sooth burns and boils. “There’s a little tweak in your head when you realize something is useful and not just a weed,” says Morinich. “It might have been something growing through a crack in the sidewalk you’ve stepped over a thousand times.” (A guide to Philadelphia's diverse food scene.) “Truffle hunting is like an Easter egg hunt on steroids,” says Amico Roma’s Kevin McFarland, who breeds fungi-sniffing dogs just outside of Portland, Oregon, with his partner, Carly Luzader. From November through March, the couple takes guests on expeditions to find white Oregon winter truffles with a little help from their Lagotto Romagnolos, dogs which have been following their snouts to the rare delicacies for centuries in Italy. “When a dog marks a spot, you know you’re going to get a truffle, but you don’t know how big it is. It’s magical.” The dog only points with its nose, it’s up to the humans to use a spoon to carefully extract the truffle, which usually weighs anywhere from less than an ounce to a couple ounces. After a one- to two-hour foray into the woods guests return to McFarland and Luzader’s home for a cooking class that includes tips on cleaning truffles and infusing them into cheese and almonds. For dessert, there’s chocolate-chip banana bread slathered with—what else?—truffle butter. In 1986, Steve “Wildman” Brill was arrested in New York City’s Central Park for harvesting and eating dandelion greens. The charge was dropped, and ever since, the naturalist and forager has been leading walking tours around the 843-acre greenway. He points out dozens of edible uncultivated plants, from mustard greens and wisteria in spring to black walnuts and spicebush berries in the fall. Along the way, he talks about how to cook and eat the wild ingredients as well as the park’s environmental diversity. “First you’re on a lawn; a one-minute walk, you’re at the edge of a thicket; another minute, you’re in the woods,” he says. The high desert surrounding Santa Fe, New Mexico, is surprisingly rich with edible plants, including mustard greens and wintercress in spring, summertime chokecherries, and oyster and honey mushrooms come autumn. Travelers can harvest them during tours in and around the city led by wild food expert Ellen Zachos. After hunting for ingredients, tours end with a class on incorporating wild ingredients into cocktails and cooking. Garlic mustard martini, anyone? “I find most people learn better, and knowledge sticks with them longer, if they can put their hands on the food, eat it, and say, ‘I made this and it’s delicious,’” she says.   Travelers can get their hands—and nets—on the fish and seaweed of Northern California’s coastline during Sea Foragers’ 3-4-hour guided tours of Half Moon Bay, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Kirk Lombard, a onetime commerical fisherman and author of The Sea Forager's Guide to the Northern California Coast, teaches participants about identifying edible seaweeds, harvesting clams, and wielding a poke pole to catch eel and rockfish in the cracks and crevices of the intertidal zone. “I'm trying to impart that [foraging] is something they can do and for them to see how beautiful it all is,” he says.

26,Alice Sun,Why giant Antarctic sea spiders are surprisingly good dads,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/giant-sea-spiders-dads-fathers,"The spindly-legged creatures, which are not closely related to spiders, defy expectations of fatherhood in the animal kingdom.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"The spindly-legged creatures, which are not closely related to spiders, defy expectations of fatherhood in the animal kingdom. Any schoolkid will tell you seahorse dads carry their babies. But sea spiders? There are 1,500 species of these long, spindly-legged denizens, found in oceans worldwide, and most are doting fathers that care for their unborn young. They range from tiny creatures roaming intertidal pools to behemoths stalking the polar depths. The fact that male sea spiders play such a big role in raising offspring just adds to their smorgasbord of strangeness. Though they’re arthropods—the phylum that includes spiders, insects, and crustaceans—sea spiders are not closely related to spiders. In fact, these animals also have a tiny body and store all their internal organs in their limbs. “They’re all legs,” says Felipe Barreto, an evolutionary biologist at Oregon State University. “They’re kind of their own thing.” (Read how sea spiders “breathe” through their legs.) Now, a recent study on male giant Antarctic sea spiders, the world’s largest, offers a new clue on how their fathering behavior may have arisen. In the past, male sea spiders may have attached eggs to a safe place, like a rock. Over the eons, the animals likely started gluing eggs on themselves to help their young survive—providing them with an evolutionary advantage. In most sea spider species, males use ovigers, an extra set of little arms that aid in grooming and to attach fertilized eggs onto their bodies, says Claudia Arango, a sea spider expert at the Queensland Museum in Australia. “It’s quite a big job,” she says. Methods of egg-carrying vary across species. For instance, some sea spiders package eggs in a mucus-y blob and carry it on their torso. Others roll their offspring into little balls. Some attach them directly to their legs. The males can carry these eggs for several weeks or months. When the eggs hatch, baby sea spiders, or larvae, often continue to cling onto the caring father for a period of time. They eventually crawl away when they find a food source like an anemone. Previously, no one knew if male Antarctic giant sea spiders also provided care. Males of these dinner plate-size spiders lack ovigers, and scientists had also never observed a male Antarctic sea spider carrying eggs. (See photos of excellent animal dads.) In the latest study, scientists captured Antarctic sea spiders from the wild and observed their mating and reproduction in the laboratory. The researchers found that, unlike other sea spiders, Antarctic giant sea spiders don’t attach eggs to their bodies. Instead, they meticulously glue their eggs to a rock or other substrate at the bottom of the ocean. For two days, “the male just kind of walks around the egg mass and seems to be grooming it,” says study leader Amy Moran, a marine physiological ecologist at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. This behavior may provide a possible explanation on how male sea spiders evolved to be the primary parent. “We [now] have evidence of a species that does something in the middle. They're not quite attached to the body, which is very costly, but they still provide some care,” says Barreto, who wasn’t involved with the research. Adds Moran: “It sort of opens up this sort of new view of how that might have happened.  Some research shows carrying eggs can be a huge sacrifice for males. Eggs can weigh him down and make him less able to clean or take care of himself, says Barreto.  Sometimes males carry so many egg masses, his body is no longer visible. That can make them more susceptible to threats like parasites. ""It can take a lot of energy,"" Barreto says. (Read about the pesky hitchhikers that make life miserable for Antarctic sea spiders.)  Why male sea spiders invest so many resources into their offspring, however, is unknown. The females, in this case, are often only present during mating, when she lets go of her fertilized eggs. Regardless, learning about sea spider males reveals how little we know about the marine arthropods, and how the animal kingdom can subvert expectations. “Every expedition to a remote island or remote seamount, scientists come back with new species with something new that we didn't, we didn't know,” says Arango. For instance, recent research has found that sea spiders can regenerate segments of their bodies. “There’s a lot of excitement that comes with finding such fascinating creatures,” says Arango. “They’re full of mysteries.""

27,Daryl Austin,"Becoming a dad is good for your health, according to science",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-health-benefits-of-fatherhood,"Fatherhood is no easy role, but psychologists say it comes with a host of mental and physical health advantages that benefit both dads and their offspring.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Fatherhood is no easy role, but psychologists say it comes with a host of mental and physical health advantages that benefit both dads and their offspring. The costs of fatherhood are well known: financial responsibilities and related stress, diminished sleep, and less free time. But there are also plenty of mental and physical upsides that come from taking on such a pivotal caregiving role.  These include greater stores of empathy, improved longevity, and more happiness and meaning in life. ""Men also report improvements in diet and exercise and less substance use after becoming fathers,” says Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan, a psychology professor at Ohio State University and a fellow of the National Council on Family Relations. “And dads who are more involved with their children are more satisfied with their lives and are more connected with friends, family, and community."" A present father can also provide unmatched benefits for the kids they are raising. ""Children who grow up with invested fathers have better social, emotional, and academic outcomes than children without such fathers,"" says Lee Gettler, a biological anthropologist and director of the Hormones, Health, and Human Behavior lab at the University of Notre Dame. Of course, related upsides also apply to mothers and all committed guardians and caregivers, but in honor of Father's Day, it's appropriate to highlight the seemingly superhuman benefits that come from being a superhero dad.  Parenthood can be great for a father's mental health by improving feelings of compassion, increasing life fulfillment, and by providing higher rates of satisfaction with job performance and work/life balance.  ""I and other researchers have consistently found that caring for and spending time with one’s children is associated with emotional benefits for all parents, and especially for dads,"" says Katherine Nelson-Coffey, a behavioral scientist, researcher, and the director of the Social Connection & Positive Psychology lab at Arizona State University. Nelson-Coffey has measured these benefits across multiple studies by comparing day-to-day activities in which men commonly engage while looking at who those activities were done with and what emotions were experienced during each one. ""We've consistently found that fathers report more positive emotions and a sense of meaning when they are spending time with their children compared to the other activities they do during the day,"" she explains. New fathers also experience a flood of happy hormones. ""We've published research showing that fathers’ oxytocin increases substantially when they first hold their babies shortly after they are born,"" says Gettler.  Another noteworthy change that occurs when men become fathers is that, as they spend time with their infants and young children, they experience a decrease in testosterone. ""Higher testosterone focuses time and energy on mating efforts and competition, while lower testosterone shifts time and energy commitments towards partnering and parenting,"" says Gettler, who co-authored the first large longitudinal study measuring such changes.  The resulting empathy and understanding stemming from these hormone changes are among the reasons that, ""on a behavioral level, anthropologists have been aware for a long time that those cultures where men live in close proximity to children tend to be less bellicose and less likely to initiate war,"" says Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, professor emerita at the University of California, Davis and author of the book, Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding. (This Father’s Day, meet 6 extreme animal dads) Beyond hormonal changes, fathers also experience many positive emotions when their children say something amusing, learn a new skill, or show tender affection through words or hugs. ""Experiencing frequent positive emotions these ways are important building blocks for mental health and well-being,"" says Nelson-Coffey. In a supportive study that Nelson-Coffey co-authored and published this year, she showed fathers also experiencing a sense of gratitude that ""predicted greater life satisfaction and fewer negative emotions over time."" Gettler points to additional related research that shows that ""partnered fathers who live with their children are also less likely to be depressed than single men without children."" He says this is likely associated with the happy emotions that fathers frequently feel while caring for their children and because of the satisfaction some men experience when providing for their family's financial needs. Dads also often experience many new social opportunities because of their children such as meeting other adults through child-centered sports participation, parent-teacher conferences at school, playdate arrangements, and scouting. Karen Fingerman, a human development and family sciences professor at The University of Texas at Austin, says such opportunities are especially appreciated when a family moves to a new city. Supporting this, Nelson-Coffey points to one of her parenting studies, which found that men with children experience a greater sense of social connection compared to men without children. She explains that when men feel connected to others, ""they are less likely to experience loneliness, which is a major risk factor for the development of depression and other mental health concerns.""  Beyond such mental and social advantages, fathers also experience many physical health benefits. For instance, studies show that men are more likely to avoid drugs and ditch harmful substances like tobacco and alcohol, in part, because ""young children help fathers to consider and prioritize what's most important in life,"" says Jay Fagan, professor emeritus at the school of social work at Temple University and the former co-director of the Fatherhood Research and Practice Network. Another related outcome Fagan points to “is a decrease in negative behaviors, fewer accidents, and less contact with the criminal justice system.""  Nelson-Coffey says that eating habits also often improve as fathers work to model a balanced diet and healthier eating behaviors to encourage their children to do the same.  Dads also commonly make more time to engage in physical activity and play with their kids—interactions that benefit father and child alike. ""When fathers engage in physical exercise and make it fun and a habit to take their kids, the kids also learn that exercising and staying healthy is fun and good for them,"" says Natasha Cabrera, professor of human development and quantitative methodology at the University of Maryland. And while there is scientific evidence that some men gain weight and what's often called the ""dad bod"" after becoming a father, Gettler notes that it's occurrence may sometimes be more cultural than related to parenting as he didn’t find evidence of this occurring in another country in recent related research. Timing may also play a part in cases of new fathers packing on some extra weight. Nelson-Coffey notes that during the early years of fatherhood, fathers are more likely to be sleep deprived and are often less physically active, but that usually changes as their kids age and often because of their kids. ""So, although there may be a cost in the early years, parents may benefit physically as their kids get older,"" she says.    Some of these physical health benefits help explain several studies that show ""that fathers live longer than men without children, even controlling for marital status,"" says Jason Carroll, the Wheatley Institute's family initiative director at Brigham Young University in Utah.  Efforts to be more physically fit and eat better likely occur because fatherhood ushers in greater life meaning for many men. ""Becoming a father often gives men an expanded vision and a new sense of identity and purpose—changing a man's priorities in life and giving him a sense that his choices matter,"" says Carroll. Of course, even when certain mental and physical health outcomes are better for dads when compared to non-dads, fatherhood is an exceptionally demanding role that can be its own source of enormous stress. ""Fathers can suffer from depression because parenting is intense and difficult as much as it is joyous and rewarding,"" says Cabrera.  She points out that becoming a new father can also be intimidating and overwhelming for many dads, and that relationships with teenage children can be especially fraught with tension. When navigating these uncharted waters, many fathers experience high levels of anxiety and self-doubt. ""Fathers also often feel the responsibility to work harder and longer hours to support their children, which can put a lot of strain on their physical health,"" she adds.  Children can also distract away from quality time with one's partner and be a strain on one's marriage, notes Nelson-Coffey.  Because of such factors, ""it's important for all parents, including fathers, to pay attention to how they are feeling, both mentally and physically, and to take steps to strengthen their health,"" advises Schoppe-Sullivan. While it may feel tempting or unavoidable to neglect one's wellbeing, she says, getting enough sleep and exercise and planning plenty of ""you time"" is still crucial. ""Healthy parents make better parents and better partners."" Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"

Although he was inspired by questionable sources, we now know if his search was in vain.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"In 1925, explorer and surveyor Percy Fawcett disappeared in the Amazon basin looking for an ancient civilization. Although he was inspired by questionable sources, we now know if his search was in vain. When the Spanish first ventured into the Amazon Basin in the 1540s, they recorded Indigenous accounts of a lost city of fantastic wealth that they called El Dorado (“the golden”). Over the centuries, many vain attempts were made to locate a lost civilization in the Amazon rainforest. The last significant attempt to find such a culture was undertaken by British explorer Percy Fawcett. Between 1906 and 1924, Fawcett made seven expeditions across the Amazon Basin, concluding with his doomed quest to find the city he called Z. Fawcett was inspired by his extensive reading of historical sources, including a mysterious document known as Manuscript 512. A man of extraordinary mental and physical stamina, Fawcett was working at a time when the Amazon region was still largely undocumented by Europeans who sought to explore its jungles and waterways, seeking ancient cities and riches. His disappearance during his search for Z in 1925, in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, continues to intrigue writers and filmmakers. (The true story of the 'lost city' made famous by Indiana Jones.) Percy Harrison Fawcett was born in 1867 in Torquay, Devon, the English county that had produced many famous explorers and mariners, including Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh. The son of an aristocrat who had lost his fortune, Fawcett described his childhood as lacking in affection. At age 19, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery and sent to outposts of the British Empire. In 1901, Fawcett joined the Royal Geographical Society of London and traveled to Africa as a surveyor in the service of the British state, tasked with gathering military intelligence. In 1906, he was commissioned by the society to lead an expedition to the Amazon. Arriving in South America was the moment his whole life changed. Setting out from La Paz to map the vast territory on the borderlands of Bolivia and Brazil, Fawcett often faced hostility from Indigenous peoples angered by rubber barons, who had invaded their lands to extract rubber for use in car and train manufacturing. For nearly a decade he roamed the Amazon Basin, often the first European to record geographical features such as waterfalls. His writing gives a sense of the awe he experienced: Above us rose the Ricardo Franco hills, flat topped and mysterious, their flanks scarred by deep quebradas [ravines]. They stood like a lost world, forested to their tops, and the imagination could picture the last vestiges of an age long vanished. The outbreak of World War I interrupted this rich period of exploration, forcing him to return to Europe. Although in his 50s, Fawcett was in peak physical condition, and he proved to be an outstanding soldier. (These other explorers disappeared into thin air. Will we ever know the truth?) Fawcett could not shake off the allure of South America, however. So, when the war ended, he returned to Brazil, where he would pursue an idea that led him to his last great adventures and, ultimately, his mysterious death. Although Fawcett often relied on racist tropes and ideas when he wrote of Brazil’s Indigenous peoples, he also made great efforts to understand their customs and languages. He lamented the effects of colonialist greed on these societies and became convinced that Spanish and Portuguese accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries of complex civilizations in the rainforest may have had merit. Such accounts mention “very large settlements” as well as “fine roadways in the interior.” One document in particular fascinated Fawcett. Known as Manuscript 512 and written in Portuguese, it is purportedly an account by adventurers and fortune hunters. In 1753, in search of precious metals, the adventurers found a ruined city boasting monumental buildings, roads, and a plaza, in “each corner of which is a spire, in the style of the Romans.” Scholars are divided about the manuscript’s authenticity. Skeptics consider it a forgery. Brazil achieved independence from Portugal in 1825. It would have been useful for a new, insecure republic to “discover” a document that described ancient civilizations in its territory—akin to the great Maya sites in Central America. Many at the time, however, accepted the manuscript’s authenticity, including Fawcett, already convinced that early accounts of complex civilizations in the rainforest were accurate. He became obsessed with finding such a place. Although Fawcett was inspired by Manuscript 512’s claims, he never intended to find the city it described. The settlement in that document lies, supposedly, in Brazil’s northeast. Citing other sources (which he did not name), Fawcett became convinced that a lost civilization existed in the wild, central-western region of Mato Grosso. He named the city Z. In April 1925, Fawcett set out from Cuiabá to find it, accompanied by his eldest son, Jack, and his son’s best friend, Raleigh Rimell. The last news from them was in a letter Fawcett sent to his wife: “We shall disappear from civilization until next year. Imagine us ... in forests so far untrodden by civilised man.” And then they really did disappear. Were they killed by animals or people? Several expeditions were launched in an attempt to clarify what happened, including one headed by Peter Fleming, brother of the James Bond creator Ian Fleming. Many of these ventures also ended in tragedy. And none shed any light on what happened to Fawcett. (This Arctic murder mystery remains unsolved after 150 years.) In 1952, anthropologist Orlando Villas-Bôas announced he had found the bones of the explorer and that Kalapalo Indians had confessed to killing him. Later forensic analysis showed the remains did not belong to Fawcett. Fawcett’s story has had an enduring cultural impact. He is one of the inspirations for the character Indiana Jones. (The Walt Disney Company is a majority owner of National Geographic Media.) The English explorer was also the subject of David Grann’s The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon, the basis for a 2016 feature film. In his book, Grann quotes Kalapalo Indians, who insist they had not killed Fawcett. They had seen the smoke from Fawcett’s camp for a few days until it stopped. They say he likely died at the hands of “hostile” people in territory to the east. (Did Indiana Jones help or hurt archaeology?) Although the mystery of his last days may never be fully resolved, Fawcett’s quest for a lost city may be at an end. In the decades since his disappearance, exploration of northeastern Mato Grosso has uncovered the remains of large urban settlements, now located in Xingu Indigenous Park. Named Kuhikugu, the complex includes remnants of streets, bridges, and large squares. Modern lidar scans further suggest that between 1,500 and 400 years ago, this part of the Amazon was indeed the site of a large settlement. While Z’s exact identity and location are still a mystery, Fawcett’s hunch about a hidden ancient city in the region seems to have been correct.

29,Natalie Berry,Everything to know about climbing Mount Kilimanjaro,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-climb-mount-kilimanjaro,"To summit Kilimanjaro is an expedition of a lifetime. Whether you’re a seasoned mountaineer or a first-timer, there are key questions to consider before tackling the Tanzanian peak.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"To summit Kilimanjaro is an expedition of a lifetime. Whether you’re a seasoned mountaineer or a first-timer, there are key questions to consider before tackling the Tanzanian peak.  A sunrise ascent of Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro while taking in panoramic views across the savanna is an unforgettable experience. Soaring upwards from the Tanzania-Kenya border, Kilimanjaro is Africa’s highest mountain at 19,340ft, one of the Seven Summits and the world’s highest standalone mountain. Also known as ‘the Roof of Africa’, the dormant volcano’s sheer scale combines with geological intrigue, natural beauty and a rich human history to attract 30,000-plus climbers annually.   In 1887, Chagga tribe member Yohani Lauwo led an expedition that saw Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller become the first Europeans to reach the summit. Lauwo lived to age 125 and became known as ‘The Old Man of Mount Kilimanjaro’. Today, his grandson Joshua Mlay follows in his footsteps as a guide for Intrepid Ventures. “I keep on practising my grandpa’s legacy, because every time I get up there I feel a sense of belonging,” he says.  The trek ascends through five climate zones — bushland, rainforest, heath, alpine desert and finally an icy arctic landscape. A range of wildlife roams the plains, including leopards and elephants, and you trek to a soundtrack of colobus monkey calls and tropical birdsong. At the summit, peer into craters and an ash pit fringed with the ice cliffs of a glacier.  Kilimanjaro is more of a long, high-altitude trek than a technical climb (you don’t need ropes, ice axes or crampons), so it’s suitable for people with no climbing skills. Having a basic level of fitness will make the experience more enjoyable rather than an arduous test of endurance.   If you’re capable of long walks, a few months of regular walks, runs or hikes will build strength and stamina in your legs — plus confidence in your ability. If you lack basic fitness, a longer period of preparation should get you in sufficient shape.   Joshua recommends consulting with your doctor if you have concerns about your fitness or ability to cope at altitude. “Kilimanjaro is doable, but you need to come with a positive mind and very positive vibes,” he says.   Regulations state that climbers must ascend with a local guide. This means any expedition operator based outside of Tanzania will run its tours in collaboration with companies on the ground, contributing to the local economy.   With so many options, it’s important to do your research when considering expedition outfitters. “Make sure the tour operator is licensed by the Kilimanjaro National Park and registered with the Tanzania Association of Tour Operators,” Jon Gupta, of Mountain Expeditions, advises.   Don’t be tempted by the cheapest prices — these can indicate scrimping and saving by any combination of rushing the climb, using poor-quality equipment or forgoing critical items and/or paying unfair wages to porters and staff. Reading online reviews can help to gauge standards.   Numerous airlines fly to Kilimanjaro International Airport. The route you choose will determine your starting point, but many climbers make their way by minibus or taxi to Moshi or Arusha, gateway towns to Kilimanjaro National Park.   During the trek, you’ll sleep in huts or tents provided by the outfitter and carried by porters between camps. Cooks prepare carb-heavy, energy-rich and easily digestible meals, plus local delicacies such as mandazi (African doughnuts), all washed down with stomach-settling ginger tea.   A longer climb will be more expensive, but it’s important to weigh the risks of struggling at altitude or failing to summit on a rushed climb versus the extra money spent on taking it slow and increasing your chances of reaching the top.  The dry seasons are the optimum time to climb, running from January to March and from June to October. “These months offer the best chances of clear skies and dry conditions, which can make the climb easier and more enjoyable,” Jon says.  But don’t underestimate the temperature variation, both as you ascend and over the course of the day. At the base, temperatures can reach up to 30C, while at the summit, they can drop to as low as -20C at night. “The temperature drops by around 6C for every 1,000 metres of altitude gain,” he adds.   There’s a network of seven official routes up Kilimanjaro, with some link-up combinations. “It’s difficult to pinpoint the best route for climbing Kilimanjaro as it depends on individual preferences and fitness levels,” Jon says.   Routes vary in length, steepness, popularity and scenic variety. Your tour operator can advise on which of their routes fit both your ability (for example, a more gradual climb) and expectations (the best views versus quieter paths). The Marangu route is the busiest. It’s the only route with huts and is easily accessible from Moshi with one of the shortest climbs. It can be done over five days, but the lack of time to acclimatise impacts its success rate and the descent retraces the ascent route, which limits views and causes two-way traffic.   A longer choice is the Machame route, enabling slower acclimatisation, while the even longer Lemosho is quieter and has the best views. Both have high success rates. The moderate, remote Rongai route is the only one to ascend from the north and offers good monkey-spotting opportunities. For experienced climbers, the Umbwe is the shortest and steepest.   Most teams summit and descend in around five to nine days. The climb is best done in ‘pole pole’ style, meaning ‘slowly’ in Swahili. “Create your own rhythm and go at a consistent pace from day one so that by the time the steepness increases, you can handle it,” Joshua says.   Having more days in hand to climb maximises your chances of summiting. “You’ll have plenty of time to acclimatise plus the opportunity to climb higher and sleep low,” he explains. The descent is usually split over two days.   Additional activities in the area include visiting caves and waterfalls in the national park, touring banana and coffee plantations, or going on a safari.   A good operator should provide you with a kit list and hire options. Since the routes pass through five climate zones, you’ll start in the humid rainforest and summit in a windy arctic landscape. Bring plenty of layers so you can stay warm and dry at each stage. Start with breathable base layers and build warmth with a fleece and insulated jacket. Pack waterproofs, too, and thermal layers for night-time. Other essentials include comfy shoes, a cap for protection, sunscreen and a warm hat and gloves.   Key equipment includes trekking poles, a head torch and an insulated sleeping bag. Also take a rucksack with at least a 30-litre capacity and an in-built hydration system. Pack luxury items to make your climb as comfortable as possible (snacks, eye mask, inflatable pillow, etc.)   Altitude sickness (AMS) is the main risk and is the leading cause of death on the mountain. At altitudes above 2,500 metres, the oxygen thins out, resulting in symptoms from headaches, dehydration, nausea and poor appetite to more serious and potentially fatal pulmonary or cerebral oedemas.   AMS can be mitigated by acclimatising properly, taking it slow, keeping hydrated and climbing with accredited, first-aid-trained guides who can spot symptoms developing and respond promptly with bottled oxygen, as well as descend with the casualty if necessary. Responsible operators will also perform daily heart rate and pulse oximeter checks.   The climb can also be tough psychologically, especially since high altitude impairs sleep quality. To keep spirits up, guides often teach the song Jambo Bwana, which means ‘hello, sir’ in Swahili. “It’s a motivational theme tune,” Joshua says.   A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Kilimanjaro is sacred to the local Chagga people, revered as a source of life and fertility.   Respect the local people and environment. Check the sustainability credentials of tour operators. Follow the ‘leave no trace’ principle: don’t litter, use the camp toilets where possible and keep to marked paths. Single-use plastic is banned in the national park, so pack a reusable bottle or hydration system. Weigh-ins ensure that porters are not overloaded and rubbish is also weighed to deter littering.   Climate change is causing Kilimanjaro’s summit glacier to vanish. Deforestation has exacerbated its effects, leading to warm, dry air blowing up the slopes. In an effort to offset your carbon travel footprint, consider donating to a local tree-planting organisation to help cool the air through the evaporation processes and shade provided by forests.   At the summit, don’t touch the remaining ice cliffs. “Poor guides allow clients to climb the delicate, fragile glacier and it causes them to collapse,” Joshua says.

According to Amber Quann KPA-CTP, CPDT-KSA, the CEO and Head Trainer at Summit Dog Training in Fort Collins, Colorado, there are several things to keep in mind when camping with your dog—and much of it starts before you even leave home.   If you’ve never taken your dog camping before, you probably have a lot of questions running through your head right now. Here, Quann breaks down a few of the most common areas of confusion.  According to the certified dog trainer, the answer to that one is “100% yes”—so long as you’re up for the challenge. Quann says she’s “a big fan” of bringing her dog along on as many of her outdoor adventures as possible, with camping being one of their favorite activities.  “If you think that you and your dog would both enjoy this process, then I would definitely recommend giving it a try,” she urges. Just like any outdoor activity, there are pros and cons to camping with your dog.  Quann says the biggest upside is probably the companionship and safety that comes with bringing your dog out into nature. “The relationship building and bonding time you enjoy while camping and hiking together [is unmatched],” she explains, adding that it’s also an excellent form of exercise (for both you and your dog). Of course, there are also potential drawbacks, including wildlife risks, campground restrictions, and all the extra packing it requires. But for most outdoor enthusiasts, the benefits of camping with your dog far outweigh any negatives. “Depending on the type of camping setting that you will be visiting, your dog may be able to be off-leash or may need to stay on-leash,” advises Quann. However, for most established campgrounds, leash rules will be in effect, which means you’ll have to plan ahead of time to keep your dog on a leash. When visiting a campground with leash rules, the dog trainer typically packs two leashes: A shorter one for walking, which measures roughly 4-7 feet, and a longer line for attaching her pup to something stationary at the campsite.  Here are a few specific things to consider when setting up a successful tie-out.   It’s also important to train your dog about what it actually means to be on a tie-out, says Quann, which may require practice at home first. “When teaching my camping dogs what it means to be on a tie out, I reward them for being calm within the bounds of their attachment radius,” she explains. “If something exciting is happening nearby, I reward them for watching calmly—not for running to the end of the tie-out, barking and lunging.” It’s also important to note that tie-outs should only be used under supervision.  “This is not the place to leave your dog while you go hiking, as this puts them at risk for wildlife encounters, as well as potentially impacting other folks enjoying the campground,” notes Quann. A general rule of thumb, according to Quann, is to choose a tent that’s made for the number of people you plan to house plus one more, so you have extra space for your dog. That said, this could vary depending on the size of your dog. “When I had my medium to large breed camping companion plus my human partner, we used a three-person tent,” the trainer explains. “Now that my camping companion dog is about 11 lbs., we have downsized to a two-person tent and everyone fits comfortably.” While some people prefer to sleep with their dog, others choose to purchase smaller tents made specifically for dogs to sleep separately. Think through the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. “I prefer having my dog sleep inside the tent with me for several reasons,” shares Quann. “They provide me with warmth and a feeling of security when they are sleeping next to me, and I don’t have to worry about them being in a separate tent. The individual dog tents may be cute, but if your dog has any separation or confinement anxiety and is not comfortable being left alone, they may be able to easily roll those small dog tents or break out of them.” Lastly, Quann recommends setting up the tent in your backyard or living room before taking your dog to a campsite for the first time. This will help familiarize them with the tent before your trip and get them comfortable with the idea of going in and out of it. “Maybe even put their cozy dog bed in there and have a little nap time sleepover to help them understand that this is a safe place to rest,” the trainer adds.

31,Tom Metcalfe,How did the Maya choose sacrifice victims? DNA yields new clues.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/maya-sacrifice-dna-chichen-itza-boys,A study of human remains deposited over 800 years at the Maya city of Chichen Itza challenges long-held assumptions about the age and gender of sacrifice victims.,2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"A study of human remains deposited over 800 years at the Maya city of Chichen Itza challenges long-held assumptions about the age and gender of sacrifice victims. Almost 60 years ago, archaeologists discovered a cache of human bones in an underground cistern in Chichén Itzá, one of the most powerful cities of the ancient Maya. The cistern was connected to a cave located only a couple hundred feet from the Sacred Cenote, a water-filled sinkhole filled with the remains of hundreds of human sacrifices.  When the discovery in the cistern, or chultún, was made on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula in 1967, archaeologists determined that young adults and children had been deposited there over a span of eight centuries and assumed that most of them were and young women; at the time, it was thought that the Maya preferred female victims for their ritual sacrifices. But now a new DNA study has turned that assumption on its head, by revealing that all of the 64 sets of human remains sampled from the cave are from male victims, many of them brothers and cousins between the ages of three and six years old—and an unlikely number of identical twins. “We were not expecting this to be the case,” says archaeogeneticist Rodrigo Barquera of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and the lead author of a new study describing the analysis just published in the journal Nature. “Traditionally, these kinds of burials are associated in Mesoamerican archaeology with fertility offerings, and fertility offerings usually feature females only.”  In recent years, Barquera and his co-authors have taken another look at the bones recovered from the chultún and cave in 1967, which are now stored nearby. Their new analysis suggests that the location was used for more than 100 burials between A.D. 500 and the 1300s.  Most of the people buried there were interred before the 900s—roughly when Chichén Itzá was the dominant city of the northern Maya lowlands, which covered what are now Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, northern Guatemala, and Belize. Earlier anthropological studies had revealed that the victims were mostly toddlers and young children; but this is the first time that their DNA has been analyzed, Barquera says. As well as learning that only boys had been buried in the cave, the researchers were surprised to find that many had been closely related: At least a quarter were a brother or cousin to another boy buried in the same cave, and the burials included two pairs of identical twins.  Identical twins occur only in about 0.4 percent of births, so finding two pairs of such twins among 64 burials is much higher than would be expected by chance, Barquera notes. It’s not clear how widespread human sacrifice was among the Maya, although there are many Spanish reports of practice after they arrived in the Maya territories in the early 16th century. It now seems the Maya mainly practiced human sacrifice in the later stages of their civilization, to seek favor from their gods for the fertility of their crops, or for rain, or for victory in war. Twins feature prominently in Mesoamerican mythology and are a central theme in the Popul Vuh, a sacred narrative of the Kʼicheʼ Maya people thought to date from the earliest stages of Maya civilization. According to the Popul Vuh, twins named Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hanahpú descended into the underworld to play a ball game, but were sacrificed by the gods after they were defeated. Despite his death, the head of one of the twins impregnated a maiden with the “Hero twins” Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, who went on to avenge their father through repeated cycles of sacrifice and resurrection. Barquera notes that subterranean structures, such as the cave where the children were buried, were seen as entrances to the underworld; and it could be that the sacrifices of boy twins and close relatives—perhaps when true twins were not available—were part of rituals involving the Hero twins that were intended to ensure bountiful harvests of maize. The new Nature study raises additional questions for archaeologists to answer. The first is the causes of death, since there are no visible human-made marks on the bones from the cave, unlike remains from the nearby Sacred Cenote. “We couldn’t find any cut marks or any lesions that would point to specific methods of sacrifice,” Barquera says. “This indicates that the sacrifice did not involve, for example, heart extraction or decapitation—so maybe it was a different kind of sacrificial method.” Further ancient DNA analysis could establish whether any of the children buried in the cave were from multiple generations of the same family, which may indicate that the honor—or curse—of providing sacrificial victims may have been an inherited privilege among certain families, Barquera says. The new analysis also involved analyzing blood samples from modern Maya who live near Chichén Itzá today; the results show a “genetic continuity” between the children buried in the cave and the modern people of the region. Barquera says this indicates that the sacrificial victims came from the local population and not more distant communities across the Maya empire. The researchers also saw distinctive differences between ancient and modern DNA sequences involving immunities to diseases, suggesting that the local Maya have adapted to certain infectious diseases, such as Salmonella enterica, introduced during the Spanish Colonial period, Barquera says. Archaeologist and National Geographic explorer Guillermo de Anda, a researcher with Mexico’s National Institution of Archaeology and History, wasn’t involved in the latest study but has spent decades researching human sacrifices at Chichén Itzá, including numerous dives into the Sacred Cenote. He recently went looking in the nearby jungle for the cave where the mass burial was discovered in 1967, but it seems to have been covered by what’s left of an airstrip built a few years later—but then abandoned—near the vast city ruins.  “We would really love it to be there, but it looks like it’s gone forever,” de Anda says. De Anda says that the proximity of the cave to the Sacred Cenote raises questions about why two different places so close to each other were both used to dispose of sacrificial victims; and the lack of visible causes of death on the bones from the cave burials is also a mystery that needs to be addressed. This seems to be the first time that ancient DNA analysis has been used on any remains from Chichén Itzá, and De Anda hopes such techniques will now be used on the bones of sacrificial victims from the Sacred Cenote. “This is a new thing for Chichén Itzá,” he says. “We are looking forward to doing it.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

32,Erin Blakemore,The 'Hello Girls' helped win WWI—why was their service overlooked?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/hello-girls-wwi-telephone-unit-signal-corps-france,"When American women were first deployed into combat zones, the U.S. refused to consider them veterans for more than 50 years.",2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"When American women were first deployed into combat zones, the U.S. refused to consider them veterans for more than 50 years. Ethel Elkins was one roughly 25,000 American women who volunteered in Europe during the First World War. But unlike most who served with the International Red Cross and other aid organizations, Elkins was one of the first female soldiers officially deployed to a combat zone—as a uniformed member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. An eager nation took note: “How many girls do you know with ‘the disposition of angels’ who can add thereto a strong constitution, soldierly fortitude, a low, musical voice, and ability to speak French just as fluently as English?” trilled a reporter in a 1918 Philadelphia newspaper article about Elkins. She was no girl, but her voice did matter: Her unit would serve as front-line telephone operators on the battlefields of France, translating, encoding, and deciphering critical messages between French and U.S. forces. Known informally as the “Hello Girls,” the 223 women of the Woman’s Telephone Unit of the American Signal Corps were known for their efficacy, patience, and fearlessness on the battlefront. But despite their historic service and the significant publicity they elicited at the beginning of their military service, Elkins and her counterparts would later be denied veteran status and military benefits, and their efforts almost completely forgotten. No longer: More than a century later, a bipartisan group of legislators is pushing for Congress to memorialize the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit’s service with the nation’s highest civilian honor: the Congressional Gold Medal. When the U.S. first entered the war in 1917, it had tried relying on French telephone operators to place calls to and from the front, but issues with English proficiency and cultural differences prompted American officials to turn to their own servicemen to do the job. That failed, too: The male soldiers’ lack of language proficiency and experience with switchboards immediately became clear. The Army needed experienced operators, and most American telephone operators at the time were women. So that same year, General John Pershing put out a call for women interested in serving their country at the front. Soon, the Army gathered a group of mostly bilingual operators, culled from single applicants who could passed psychological tests and Secret Service background checks. Subject to regular Army discipline, the women, who were an average age of 26, underwent military training including drills and lessons on military history and terminology. The first group of 33 telephone operators, wearing U.S. Army uniforms of navy blue wool, reported to the front in France in March 1918.  The presence of American women on European battlefields made a splash from the start, and they immediately became known as the “Hello Girls,” a term with unknown origins that emerged with the growing popularity of the telephone in the early 20th century. They operated at five times the speed of their male counterparts, says Lora Vogt, Vice President of Education and Interpretation at the National WWI Museum and Memorial, and maintained and provided the communications essential to Allied victory. The job was dangerous, historian Jill Frahm writes: The women often worked within range of German artillery, performing everything from transmitting coded messages to directing supplies to connecting commanding officers with men in the trenches, even working to get communications working when the fighting damaged wires. “The [Army Expeditionary Forces] telephone operators were a trusted part of the military machine,” writes Frahm, “something no group of women had ever been before.”  That doesn’t mean their service was easy—or that they were sheltered from casual misogyny on the front. As historian Elizabeth Cobbs documents in her book The Hello Girls: America’s First Women Soldiers, many women felt their efforts were hampered because they were stationed too far from the front, while others dealt with obvious opposition to their presence in the field from many commanding officers. In 1918, the female soldiers formally protested the nickname “Hello Girls,” resulting in a War Department directive to respectfully call them the Woman’s Telephone Unit of the American Signal Corps instead. Though the hundreds of American female telephone operators served in France through 1920, just one of them was decorated by the Signal Corps. As Cobbs notes, most even didn’t realize the U.S. government didn’t see them as soldiers until they attempted to apply for the same types of benefits offered to male military members and veterans, including combat bonuses, pensions, and military funerals. They weren’t even reimbursed for their uniforms, which the Army had made them purchase with their own money.   Only in 1977, after a lawsuit and legislation, the women granted veteran status—over the objections of the Army, the Veterans’ Administration, and even the American Legion. Today, supporters of the Hello Girls say that the efforts of 1977 didn’t go far enough. In their proposed legislation, re-introduced in May 2024, the bipartisan group from the House and Senate call for the women to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Endorsed by the American Historical Society, the American Legion, and others, the law, if passed, would officially recognize the women’s service during what co-sponsor Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II calls “a time of grave uncertainty.” The move may be seen as too little, too late by some, but Vogt says it would highlight the importance of the story not just within classrooms or in history books, but in the national conversation. These American women “were crucial in the Allied victory of World War I,” she says. “To receive this posthumous honor will help recognize the not equal—but superior—work the women within the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit contributed to the war effort.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

33,Emily Lush,Why small but mighty Armenia should be on your agenda in 2024,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-why-small-but-mighty-armenia-should-be-on-your-agenda-for-2024,"Head to Armenia this year and you'll find mythical mountains, ancient monasteries and a rapidly developing farm-to-table food scene. Here's a complete guide to visiting the unsung South Caucasus nation.",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Head to Armenia this year and you'll find mythical mountains, ancient monasteries and a rapidly developing farm-to-table food scene. Here's a complete guide to visiting the unsung South Caucasus nation. Nestled in the heart of the Caucasus region, at the geographical and ideological crossways of Europe and Asia, Armenia holds its own in terms of history, hiking and cuisine. It’s a mountainous nation, with more than half of its territory elevated between 3,000ft and 6,500ft above sea level. Sweeping plateaus — etched with canyons and bulging with extinct volcanoes — are occasionally interrupted by pockets of fertile lowland in the west, while the eastern part of the country unfolds around the sapphire waters of Lake Sevan, one of Eurasia’s largest freshwater alpine lakes. From the 'pink city', Yerevan, to the charcoal-and-gold Gyumri and the emerald Debed Canyon, here’s how to explore this colourful nation. Armenian people are fiercely proud of their language, customs and beliefs. The country was the first nation to declare Christianity as its official religion in 301 CE, and monasteries and churches occupy a special place in its heritage. More than 4,000 pepper the hills and valleys, with Etchmiadzin Cathedral, the seat of the Apostolic Church and spiritual heartland of the nation, believed to be one of the oldest Christian temples on Earth. For many visitors, it’s the rugged mountains, old-growth forests and semi-desert steppe that command attention. Hiking routes include the Transcaucasian Trail, an epic 497-mile through-hike that runs from north to south and combines agrotourism offerings with nature and culture.  Armenia also has viniculture traditions dating back more than 6,100 years, with established terroirs and 400-plus local grape varieties providing the building blocks for a world-class natural wine and brandy scene. Meanwhile, the cuisine, which favours wild herbs and fresh seasonal vegetables, is fuelling a farm-to-table movement that centres on rural villages. Armenia is well suited to those with an appetite for outdoor adventure and culture. There are ample opportunities to enjoy the landscape, from rock climbing in Noravank Canyon to kayaking at Azat Reservoir, while oenophiles can explore the Vayots Dzor Wine Route. Those with an eye for design can trace the evolution of ecclesiastical architecture, while Armenia’s urban centres — particularly Gyumri, the nation’s cultural capital, where the streets brim with art galleries and workshops — offer an insight into artisanal traditions such as woodworking, silversmithing and blacksmithing. The latter has recently been inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Anyone with even a passing interest in world history will also find Armenia captivating. Home to dozens of museums and several pre-Christian archaeological sites, Yerevan — the capital of Armenia, whose founding date of 782 BCE makes it older than Rome — is the perfect place to unravel chapters of the past. Particular highlights include the Matenadaran, a museum of manuscripts and illuminated volumes, the Cascade Complex, a grand, open-air complex which houses the Cafesjian Center for the Arts, and the History Museum of Armenia. Nicknamed the ‘pink city’ thanks to its rose- and coral-coloured tuff stone buildings, cosmopolitan Yerevan is full of sidewalk cafes, tree-lined avenues and open-air markets. The Yerevan Vernissage is a particular favourite among locals and visitors for Armenian handmade masterpieces, souvenirs and works of art.  Some of Armenia’s most important monasteries are within an hour’s drive of the capital: the UNESCO-listed Geghard is located deep in a gorge and almost invisible until the final approach; Khor Virap sits on a plateau in the shadow of Mount Ararat; and Zvartnots Cathedral is an example of medieval architecture. But it’s the ninth-century Tatev that’s perhaps the most spectacular. Proudly perched on an outcrop in the Syunik Province, five hours south east of Yerevan, this monastic complex impresses as visitors approach via cable car on the Wings of Tatev, the world’s longest reversible aerial tramway. While in the south, be sure to also venture to Khndzoresk, a cave city that was inhabited up until the 1950s, and Zorats Karer, a prehistoric site composed of over 200 carved monoliths. The north of Armenia, meanwhile, is a more verdant area which is well primed for those seeking to immerse themselves in nature. The town of Dilijan is a departure point for forest hikes that lead to sapphire lakes and ancient ruins, while, further north, a visit to two more monasteries, the UNESCO-listed Haghpat and Sanahin, can be paired with whitewater rafting on the Debed River. As you move across the country, a taste of rural life and village hospitality can be found in the many ‘gastro yards’. Located inside family homes and small guesthouses, these kitchens offer home cooking at its finest, showcasing national dishes and delicacies, such as gata pastries near Haghartsin Monastery, and cheese in one of the southern cities, Sisian. Armenia is a year-round destination, with activities and events happening throughout every season. The autumn months are great for wine-lovers, with the harvest spirit sweeping through the vineyards. The hiking season also extends into early November, when splendid autumn foliage decorates Dilijan National Park. Winter is a fine time for an off-season city break, soaking in the mineral-rich Jermuk Hot Springs and skiing in Tsaghkadzor or Yeghipatrush. Late March sees apricot trees beginning to bloom and pop-up dinners held in blossoming orchards around Yerevan, while summer is best for trekking at higher altitudes, watersports on Lake Sevan and seeing sunsets at Debed Canyon.

34,Jason Bittel,Extremely rare—and sacred—white buffalo calf born in Yellowstone,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/white-buffalo-yellowstone-birth,"“There are prophecies about white buffalo calves being born at a time of great change,” says one expert. How rare are white bison—and what does this birth mean?",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"“There are prophecies about white buffalo calves being born at a time of great change,” says one expert. How rare are white bison—and what does this birth mean? It’s not often that the birth of a wild animal causes a stir among so many different groups of people, but a white American bison calf photographed in Wyoming has done just that. “We’re in Yellowstone this week and just missed this birth by a few minutes!” wrote photographer Erin Braaten in a Facebook post on June 4. “A white bison calf!!” News of the birth quickly spread around the world after that.  Images of albino, yellow, or blonde animals—from giraffes, tapirs, and monkeys to cougars, badgers, and frogs and snakes—often fascinate the public. But this pale bison, also known as an American buffalo, has special significance in Indigenous cultures.  “There are prophecies about white buffalo calves being born at a time of great change,” says Jason Baldes, a member of the Eastern Shoshone tribe and executive director of the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative. “We have stories of the Eastern Shoshone people hunting and pursuing white bison or white buffalo from well over a century ago.” (At long last, the American buffalo has come home.) Buffalo used to roam from Alaska to Mexico and number between 30 to 60 million. Although that population was driven down to just 325 animals by 1884, scientists and conservationists have since rescued bison from the brink of extinction. But most of the 30,000 buffalo that exist today aren’t as free or as wild as you might think. “With the momentum that we see with bison restoration and conservation, I think this will help to bring awareness about the importance of, not only the sacredness of that white buffalo calf, but also the issue of [buffalo] existing as wildlife,” says Baldes, who is also a National Geographic Explorer. While studies about the frequency of albinism or leucism have taken place in animals such as penguins, white buffalo are much less studied. One statistic bandied about online, and misattributed to the National Bison Association, is that a white buffalo calf will occur in one out of every 10 million births.  (Rare ""blonde"" penguin spotted in Antarctica. See the photo.) “To my knowledge, no one has kept consistent records of white buffalo being born,” says Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association. “Therefore it’s tough to make a determination of occurrence.” At least anecdotally speaking, there haven’t been many in the last few decades, says Robert Pickering, author of Seeing the White Buffalo. Most of the white bison you do hear about actually come from cross-breeding bison and white Charolais cattle. “There’s a lot of private producers, folks that are in the bison industry, that realize that there’s a lot of attention garnered from white bison calves,” says Baldes. “And that really is not a good thing in terms of conservation for bison.” Matheson and the National Bison Association agree. “Our code of ethics would forbid that type of cross breeding,” he says. The other, less common ways you can get a white bison would be examples of albinism or leucism, genetic conditions that affect pigmentation. Bison with albinism would have pink eyes, hooves, and noses, while leucistic animals lack pigment in some but not all of their tissues. (What is albinism—and how's it different from leucism?) Pickering’s book catalogued another instance of the latter in Wisconsin in 1994. Named Miracle, that buffalo was born with white fur, but black eyes, hooves, and nose. It’s the animals with these leucistic features that appear across many Native American cultures, from the Sioux to the Cherokee. The new calf appears to be of that same sacred variety, says Pickering. “Now, the interesting part about Miracle, and we’ll see if it’s going to be true about this new calf,” says Pickering, “although it was born with a white pelage, Miracle turned nearly black when she got her winter coat.” Even more curious, as the seasons changed, Miracle next turned reddish and then yellowish. “Red, yellow, black and white are the four sacred Lakota colors,” Pickering says. “So in a sense, that verified that she was a spiritual being.” “The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning,” Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, told the Associated Press. “We must do more,” says Looking Horse, who is the 19th keeper of the White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle, a sacred artifact to his people. As senior buffalo program manager through the National Wildlife Federation's Tribal Partnerships Program and vice president to the InterTribal Buffalo Council, Baldes has been working to restore bison to tribes that want to have them.  “We, the Eastern Shoshone, call ourselves the Buffalo Eaters, the Gweechoondeka, even though they were missing from our diet for well over 130 years,” says Baldes. “Most buffalo exists today in private herds and ranches,” he says. “They are essentially ecologically extinct.” One way to remedy this is to buy land and release bison onto it. So far, the InterTribal Buffalo Council has managed to acquire 25,000 wild bison across 65 herds held on tribal land. More recently, at Wind River, Baldes helped get approval to convert 17,000 acres of cattle pasture into bison habitat. “The limitation, often-times for tribes, is land,” he says. Restoring bison to the landscape is of the utmost importance, he argues—and not only for the ancient eco-cultural importance that this species holds for Native American tribes. “They increase plant and animal biodiversity. That should be reason enough,” says Baldes. Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"
35,Stephen Starr,These destinations offer kayakers a unique adventure: underground paddling,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/underground-kayaking-destinations,"From Kentucky’s Red River Gorge to Slovenia’s ancient tunnels, journey through hidden caverns and forgotten mines for a kayaking experience like no other.",2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"From Kentucky’s Red River Gorge to Slovenia’s ancient tunnels, journey through hidden caverns and forgotten mines for a kayaking experience like no other. Descending into a chasm on the side of an eastern Kentucky mountain might not sound like an epic start to a kayaking expedition. Yet, here in the heart of the Red River Gorge Geological Area, a 29,000-acre canyon system home to sandstone arches, cliffs, and abandoned mines, it is the best way to experience water without the crowds.   With U.S. kayak sales up nearly 25 percent from pre-pandemic levels as of March 2023, congested lakes and rivers have become the norm. This trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down, with the global kayaking market projected to approach one billion dollars by 2031.   Yet, for those seeking tranquility on the water, there remain undiscovered havens—hidden beneath the surface. Our guide, JP Stamper, leads down into a chilly cavern with a life jacket, helmet, and paddle in hand. Flashlights flicker on as we navigate around icy water cascading from the mine’s ceiling, 40 feet above. Venturing deep underground on water might seem daunting to some, but there’s an overwhelming sense of calm that accompanies floating over still water, in surreal silence. For 90 minutes, we paddle through winding chambers and expansive caverns, our clear-bottom kayaks revealing huge boulders and rainbow trout below. Overhead, tiny Kentucky brown bats are nestled deep in their winter hibernation. Here and there, wires and pipes—remnants of a once-thriving mining industry—appear eerily preserved beneath the water’s surface. At no point during the SUP Kentucky kayaking tour did it feel claustrophobic. In the parts of the tour with the deepest water, paddlers rise within about six feet of the overhead rock. The absence of any current and the presence of our two guides on stand-up paddleboards monitoring our group also helps. Subterranean kayaking might not be at the top of the list for most paddlers, but for Don Marsan, who runs kayaking tours from the massive, 150-acre underground lake at Crystal City Cave in Missouri, there’s nothing like it. “We’ve had thousands of people from all over the world come here to try this out. We do about 20,000 people a year,” he says. SUP Kentucky saw a 26 percent increase in visitors between 2021 and 2023. Last year, it started offering unguided kayaks and paddle board tours to meet the demand from more adventurous paddlers. “We take them in, show them around, and then leave them be for two hours,” says Stamper. “But people can’t get lost—there’s a light trail that leads all the way back to the entrance.” (These trails aren’t for hikers, they’re for kayakers.) The company also offers the choice between a clear-bottom kayak or a paddleboard with multicolored LED lights illuminating the water underneath. At the Blue Springs Cavern Park in Bedford, Indiana, kayakers can navigate America’s longest navigable underground river with a local tour company that offers three-hour kayaking and boat trips 100 feet below the surface. Subterranean kayaking isn’t limited to the U.S. In Korea’s Dongyang (also known as Chungju) Jade Cave, visitors can paddle in the cool, damp underworld. In Belize’s Nohoch Che’en Caves Branch Archeological Reserve, tour operators offer kayaking and tubing through caves where ancient Mayan culture is depicted on cave walls. A 450-year-old former metal mine in northern Slovenia has become a hotspot for underground kayaking. “We had 2,100 people in 2021, last year we had 3,371, despite being closed for three weeks due to flooding in August,” says Darja Komar, the manager of Podzemlje Pece, a tour operator at the mine. Visitors take a short train ride down the mine before walking 328 feet through hip-high water to reach the kayaks. From there, paddlers spend 45 minutes on tandem kayaks, navigating through 1.7 miles of tunnels and open spaces. The guided tours are in English, German, and Slovenian, with each tour limited to 10 participants. (See the ocean’s glow-in-the-dark world on a fluorescent night dive.) “It’s not just a tour,” says Komar, “it’s an experience where you learn about the history of mining and this region.” For some, exploring subterranean water worlds from a kayak is adventurous enough, while others have taken it to another level. The Rio Chontalcoatlán in Mexico’s Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park offers one of the most challenging whitewater kayaking adventures. Expert kayakers navigate nearly two miles of underground rapids and narrow passages, guided only by tiny lights on their helmets—a venture best suited for the most skilled whitewater paddlers.

36,Alexandra Frost,The best walking shoes for plantar fasciitis in 2024,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-walking-shoes-for-plantar-fasciitis,Supportive footwear is a must for anyone with this chronic foot condition. But that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style.,2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Supportive footwear is a must for anyone with this chronic foot condition. But that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style. Nothing will put a stop to a bucket list travel adventure faster than a plantar fasciitis flare-up. The chronic foot condition that plagues thousands of Americans is the result of inflammation of a thick tissue band connecting the heels to the toes along the bottom of the foot.  Generally, treatment includes rest, stretching, and sometimes medical treatments to alleviate inflammation, Dr. Audey Nasser, podiatrist and foot specialist at University Foot Associates in Gurnee, Ill, adds. Supportive footwear is also a must-have on his treatment list. We chose the Hoka Bondi 8 as the best shoe for plantar fasciitis sufferers, though other Hoka shoes made the list as well, thanks to their careful balance of cushioning and support. (These are the 8 best Hoka shoes for walking) Choosing good shoes for plantar fasciitis is crucial for helping with pain and potentially preventing further irritation of the plantar fascia. Our picks for the best walking shoes for plantar fasciitis are: Buy it now at Hoka (Women's) (Men's) Why we like it: The Hoka Bondi 8 is one of the most cushioned shoes in the Hoka line, making it a great option for those suffering from plantar fasciitis. It’s made with lighter foams than previous versions and boasts a new extended heel geometry, giving you a soft and balanced step each time you move. It also has removable insoles so you can use your own orthotics if needed, and received the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance for good foot health. It’s suitable for everyday activities, including walking and running, so it makes it the best overall shoe for plantar fasciitis — even if your condition isn’t letting you run marathons anytime soon. Keep in mind: These shoes do have a wider heel, so for some consumers, they might not be aesthetically appealing. Some reviews have mentioned that they feel like they’re wearing “clown shoes,” so it might be worth trying them on to see if they meet your personal preferences. On the other hand, bulkier sneakers seem to be trending, and comfort is always trending — especially in painful conditions. Product details: Materials: Mesh, memory foam, polyester, rubber | Shoe type: Everyday walking/running shoe | Width: Regular and wide | Heel drop: 4.00 mm | Sizes: 5-12  (The 8 best walking shoes for men) Buy it now at New Balance Why we like it: The New Balance 990v6 provides a great combination of cushioning —from its lightweight midsole cushioning with a durable rim to its removable padded footbed. It also has a breathable lining and adjustable laces. These unisex shoes have a plush but supportive feel and might be a great alternative to those who find Hokas to be too bulky — a common complaint for men who don’t want to feel they are walking on platforms to get pain relief. Keep in mind: There aren’t loads of color options, so if you prefer a brighter color or something beyond black, navy, and gray, the New Balance 990v6 might not be your best fit. Product details: Materials: Mesh, suede and synthetic overlays | Shoe type: Running shoe | Width: Standard (D) | Heel drop: 10 mm | Sizes: Men’s 4-14, women’s 5.5-15.5  (The 9 best walking shoes for women) Buy it now at KURU Why we like it: The Kuru Roam Atla is a slip-on shoe that offers plenty of support. Their heel-hugging design means your heels don’t hurt, and the insole hugs your feet and arches, providing comfort that lasts much longer than other shoes. Kuru has recently been pushing the orthopedic/comfort shoe industry forward with trendy and stylish options for those with foot conditions. This is a win for people suffering from plantar fasciitis who often have to sacrifice aesthetics for support. Women who find relief from Kuru’s sneakers might also want to try their other travel-friendly shoes that offer support for the heel, especially some of their sandal options. Keep in mind: These are wider shoes, so you might consider sizing down. Some consumers mentioned that while the toe area fits fine, the heel part was wide, and they found it more difficult to keep it on. Product details: Materials: Canvas, rubber | Shoe type: Everyday shoe | Width: Medium | Heel drop: 6 mm | Sizes: 6-11  Buy it now at Zappos Why we like it: The Brooks Beast GTS 23 combines style and functionality in a running shoe. With its wide base and generous fit, the shoe allows space for orthotics if needed. It also provides slightly more cushioning than the Brooks standard cushioning and is made for maximum support, no matter what the road ahead of you looks like. Keep in mind: This is a pricier shoe, and some customers shared that they didn’t feel the quality was as good as it should be given the price, noting some thread and stitching issues after a couple of months of wear. Product details: Materials: Mesh | Shoe type: Maximum support running shoe | Width: Medium (1D), wide (2E) and extra wide (4E) | Heel drop: 12 mm | Sizes: 8-15  (The best shoes for back pain) Buy it now at Zappos Why we like it: The Asics Gel-Kayano is the top for stability and soft cushioning. Asics uses its 4D GUIDANCE SYSTEM™ to give the shoe adaptive stability to land softly, absorb shock, and reduce overpronation. This is especially useful during long-distance events, such as training or marathons. While the point of this system is to help runners be more agile and adaptable to changing conditions and fatigue, it works well for those navigating pain conditions, in which the foot tires as well. The shoe also uses gel technology underneath the heel, giving you smoothness and softness with every step you take. Gel is one of the substances sometimes used to give extra cushiony shoes their forgiving feel. The super cushy heel makes you feel a bit springier than you would otherwise, basically energizing your sore and tired feed. Also, the brand carries around 22 colors, so you can actually pick one you love and not just a bland, boring, “supportive” shoe. Keep in mind: While stability is great, the cushioning might not be as cloud-like as you’re accustomed to or when compared to others on the list.  Product details: Materials: Stretch knit and cushioning | Shoe type: Running/distance training | Width: Standard | Heel drop: 10 mm | Sizes: 5-13  (The 6 best hiking boots for women) Buy it now at Aetrex Why we like it: Aetrex uses a built-in orthotic system, meaning you’ll have arch support that stabilizes and aligns while also helping to relieve foot pain. The shoes have extra cushioning in their insoles, giving pressure relief. The insole has antimicrobial technology to help prevent foot odors, which can minimize the need for washing them frequently. This brand also offers numerous orthotics that make any of their already supportive shoes even more comfy, especially if you have a higher arch or need specialized support. Keep in mind: Larger sizes are hard to come by, and colors are extremely limited. Product details: Materials: Premium Italian nubuck and rubber | Shoe type: Everyday active shoe | Width: Standard | Heel drop: n/a | Sizes: 5-11  (How to get rid of shoe odor) Buy it now at Zappos Why we like it: Many people love a slip-on sandal, and those with plantar fasciitis deserve one too. The Birkenstock Arizona softbed sandal is a great option for those with a wider footbed, as it has adjustable buckles, allowing you to personalize for your best fit. This sandal has an extra foam layer for added comfort, along with an EVA sole that is lightweight and flexible, made from ethylene vinyl acetate — which basically feels like foam. Birkenstocks are among the “harder” soled shoes that plantar fasciitis sufferers sometimes gravitate to for their supportive structure, but those who need a softer feel might like this style over traditional Birkenstock sandals with harder soles. Keep in mind: Pay close attention when ordering to make sure you get the correct width for your foot —that’s important, especially for those with a wider foot, as the medium width of these can fit a bit narrower. Product details: Materials: Natural leather and cork | Shoe type: Slip on | Width: Regular/Wide and Medium/Narrow | Heel drop: n/a | Sizes: 6-6.5 - 17.17.5 mens Buy it now at Kizik Why we like it: The Kizik Brisbane is a truly hands-free, slip-on shoe —ideal for when you’re on the move while traveling. I’ve tried these and found that they’re extremely comfortable with their cushioned midsoles. The insoles are also removable and washable, helping you keep your shoes smelling fresh no matter what your travel adventures lead you to. This is a key feature for people who are only able to wear a few types of shoes due to this pain issue and might re-wear them many times in a row. Kiziks are excellent for people with plantar fasciitis because you can slide your own orthotics in. Also, they offer people the chance to wear shoes that look much more like everyday streetwear and much less like an orthotic sneaker for the gym without sacrificing support.  Keep in mind: Ensure the sizing is correct so you don’t slip out of these shoes if they are too loose. Product details: Materials: Leather and cushioning | Shoe type: Everyday shoe | Width: Standard or Wide D | Heel drop: n/a | Sizes: 6-13  (Do you have bunions? Here are 7 shoes that might help) Buy it now at Zappos Why we like it: The ECCO Slip-On 2.0 is super lightweight and flexible. We also like the slip-on style and the fact that it contains a leather upper with a suede accent. The grippy bottoms give a bit of extra security and safety if you aren’t feeling super stable on your feet. These are perfect slides for those who have to go through airport security, or in and out of the car multiple times. The rounded toe bed design also gives plenty of wiggle room. Keep in mind: Sometimes, leather takes a bit more time to break in and form to your feet than typical sneakers, so be a little more patient with these. Product details: Materials: Leather and suede | Shoe type: Slip-on | Width: One option (M) | n/a | Sizes: 5-5.5 - 15-15.5 Buy it now at Hoka (Women's) (Men's) Why we like it: The Gaviota and the Clifton are two of Nasser’s favorite choices at Hoka, a brand that has changed my own life as a plantar fasciitis sufferer. The brand is known for “maximalist” styles, with substantial heel padding meant for long-distance runners or, in this case, people who don’t want plantar fasciitis to prevent them from traveling wherever they want. These maximalist styles offer more support and heel cushioning than other types of shoes, which can give people with plantar fasciitis the feeling of walking on a cloud rather than their heel striking the ground in a painful way.  Compared to other models, the Gaviota 5 is a “wider” and “more accommodating” fit, the brand says. Nasser shared that for this, and other foot conditions, feel shouldn’t be restricted, so this style can help ensure the foot is in the right place and has enough room to be truly supported. In addition, women tend to overpronate more than men do, research shows, so additional support will help women with plantar fasciitis keep their feet in the correct position for pain reduction. Keep in mind: Some find Hokas too bulky and prefer a lighter or more streamlined shoe. Product details: Materials: Mesh and foam | Shoe type: Everyday running/walking shoes | Width: Regular and wide | Heel drop: 6 mm | Sizes: 5-12 Nasser recommends choosing both reputable brands that have a track record of the best shoes for plantar fasciitis while also searching for specific qualities and support features like the following:   “Shoes with good arch support will help distribute pressure evenly across the foot,” Nasser says. You can also remove the liners or inserts from many types of shoes to replace them with orthotics for better arch support. Adequate cushioning in the heel and forefoot absorbs shock and provides comfort, Nasser says. Look for shoes that specifically promote extra cushioning in these two areas, and test them out yourself to experiment with which level of cushioning feels the best to you — it’s an individual preference but one that people with plantar fasciitis should consider. “A firm heel counter helps stabilize the heel and provides additional support,” Nasser says, describing the structured part of a shoe that wraps around the back of the heel, providing essential support. So, look to heels that aren’t floppy or unstructured in the back or lower section of the shoe to ensure the heel has substantial support around it. Minimize the impact on the feet during activities like walking or running, Nasser says, such as with shoes that have enough cushion and support in the heel.   “With plantar fasciitis, effective shock absorption in shoes will help to reduce heel impact and alleviate pain. Look for cushioning materials like EVA foam, PU foam, gel inserts, and memory foam, which provide excellent shock absorption,” Nasser says. “Shoes with additional heel cushioning, dual-density midsoles, and “rocker-bottom” soles also help minimize impact. Check material descriptions, ensure proper padding in heel and forefoot areas, and seek shoes with good arch support.” In addition, he says terms like ""maximal cushioning,"" ""extra cushioning,"" or ""high-impact cushioning"" indicate enhanced shock absorption. If you still aren’t sure, try the “pressure test,” Nasser says. “Press your thumb into the heel and forefoot areas of the shoe. Adequate cushioning should compress under pressure but return to its original shape quickly.” “Shoes should fit well, providing ample room for the toes and not being too tight or too loose,” Nasser says. Move around when testing the shoes to ensure they are the right fit before committing. A slight heel lift (around 1-2 inches) can relieve tension on the plantar fascia compared to flat shoes. Nasser shares that you can also consider the heel-to-toe “drop” called the “shoe drop” when shopping. Most reputable brands list the heel-to-toe drop in the specifications, either on the shoebox or on the brand’s website, he adds, though you can ask for this information, especially in running shoe stores.  “A well-constructed sole and midsole help maintain proper foot alignment and prevent overpronation or supination,” Nasser says. This will help you feel well-balanced regardless of what type of activity you are trying to do, even with plantar fasciitis.  “Shoes should have flexibility in the front part where the toes bend while maintaining support in the arch and heel to allow natural foot movement without excessive strain,” Nasser says. Nasser tends to favor Asics for great arch support and cushioning and Brooks for a wide range of supportive products. He also likes New Balance’s variety of styles with excellent arch support and cushioning, and Hoka’s maximalist cushioning and shock absorptions features, he says. Hoka is one of the most recommended brands for people who have plantar fasciitis, as they offer extra cushioning in the heel area and support all around the foot. They also have removable soles so you can insert more specific orthotics based on your own needs, such as a higher arch or flatter foot.  The ""drop"" of a shoe has to do with the angle of the sneaker. “It is the difference in height between the heel and the forefoot of the shoe. It can be an important factor to consider, especially for individuals with plantar fasciitis or other foot conditions,” Nasser says. People with severe foot conditions can talk to their doctor about the best shoe drop for them specifically. Some running shoe stores might also have advice based on your needs.

37,Erinne Magee,The 10 best hotels in Maine for every kind of traveler,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/10-best-maine-hotels,"These are the most beautiful places to sleep in the Pine Tree State, from a treehouse to a cliff house to a lighthouse.",2024-06-11T00:00:00Z,"These are the most beautiful places to sleep in the Pine Tree State, from a treehouse to a cliff house to a lighthouse. Maine is best known for its jagged coastlines, sprinkled with beaches in the southern parts and tucked-away seaside towns as you drive north on Route 1. But visitors shouldn’t ignore the rest of the state’s forested mountains, pristine lakes, and burgeoning small cities. These 10 hotels get you to the heart of quintessential Maine. Best for: outdoor exploration Southwest Harbor is known as the quiet side of Mount Desert Island. Next to Acadia National Park, the Claremont is just a 15-minute drive from bustling Bar Harbor. Nostalgic and luxurious, the hotel was for 43 years home to the Claremont Classic, a croquet tournament that hosted players from around the country. A court is still available for guest use and lessons are available twice each week. Garden tours, mixology classes, and daily yoga are among the activities offered. Large groups can rent one of two signature houses on property.  Good to know: The Claremont has its own boat, The Lady Clare, which can be booked for public and private tours. Best for: historic stay Overlooking Moosehead Lake, Maine’s largest, the Blair Hill Inn is a boutique hotel just down the road from picnic-perfect Lily Bay State Park. Once a popular getaway for the well-heeled New England elite in the 1830s to the 1930s, Moosehead Lake is now a laid-back community that gets a short summer rush. “Because we’re removed from the crowds often found on the coast, our guests come here for solitude and are surprised to find our property, which offers luxury accommodations, farm-to-table fine dining, and a full-service spa,” says innkeeper Jennifer Whitlow. Off-property, visitors can board Katahdin, the last of the historic steamboat fleet that once ferried tourists across the waters, for a nostalgic guided tour of Moosehead Lake. Good to know: Request room 10 for an expansive private courtyard with lake views.   Best for: luxury escape Designed by Pete Nelson of Animal Planet’s Treehouse Masters, The Woods is home to one luxury treehouse, offering a private and secluded getaway with lakefront access, 60 miles northwest of Portland in the lakeside town of Norway. “While some pockets of the state are booming with growth and development, our land stands similarly to how it was decades ago,” says Samantha Masabny, CEO and co-creator with her husband, Rob. “Guests are allowed the opportunity to just enjoy the natural landscape without it feeling over-designed.” Surrounded by 10 acres of woods, every window of the treehouse is met with a canopy of trees, creating the feeling that you really are sleeping in the sky.  Good to know: Less than a 10-minute drive from the treehouse, The Woods Store sells branded clothing, but also features the wares of local artists and makers. While in town, enjoy a cup of gelato under a colorful umbrella installation at Dolce Amici. Best for: romantic getaway  Guests board a ferry to reach the walkable island of Chebeague, situated just a 20-minute drive north of Portland. The island has less than 400 year-round residents, but the population quadruples during the summer. The Inn offers the island’s only restaurant open for dinner, so it’s common to see the fisherman who dropped off lobster in the morning returning in the evening for a bite. “From the slow ferry through Casco Bay to bellying up at the bar beside the local lobsterman, the island forces you to slow down and is a snapshot of days gone by,” says executive chef Marsh Elliot. Chebeague is five miles by one-and-a-half; walking to Hamilton Beach from the Inn is a 10-minute walk, but golf carts and bicycles are available for farther destinations. Good to know: For an added adventure when visiting the beach, walk across the sandbar to Little Chebeague Island.  Best for: exquisite views  In 1872, as the railroad started bringing tourists to the U.S. northeast, Elsie Jane Weare, wife of Captain Theodore Weare, purchased Bald Head Cliff and opened a hotel charging $6 per night, all meals included. Closed during World War II, Cliff House was used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a radar station. The hotel remained in the Weare family until 2014. While the rates have changed, the property still sits 90 feet above sea level, offering the same awe-inspiring sunrise vista over the Atlantic Ocean. “One of my favorite views is from the spa’s relaxation lounge,” says general manager Nancy White. “It’s tucked in the cliff and feels suspended in midair.” Good to know: Check out rotating local art exhibits in the resort’s Gallery. Tap into your own creativity by booking a plein air painting experience with the artist in residence.    Best for: beach vacation Recently renovated, the Dunes is dotted with 23 one-, two-, and three-bedroom whitewashed cottages overlooking popular Ogunquit Beach. Situated between picturesque sand dunes, all cottages are equipped with screened porches, fireplaces, and a breakfast delivery of coffee and pastries. Take a golf cart to the town’s center for dinner at M.C. Perkins Cove or walk next door to the lobster pound where you can choose your own live lobster before it’s handed over to the chef. Good to know: Step into a rowboat to get across the tidal river to the beach at high tide. Best for: lighthouse living  If you’ve ever wanted to sleep in a lighthouse, 90-year-old Sebasco Harbor Resort, nestled in one of the state’s quieter coastal areas, can make this dream come true. With 10 guest rooms and a top-floor observatory with window benches and comfy chairs, the lighthouse assures a birds-eye view of the harbor (don’t miss sunset). Guests also enjoy boat tours, family bingo, s’mores with campfire singalongs, and an old-school arcade with candlepin bowling. Attractions within 10 minutes’ drive from Sebasco include more lighthouses (Doubling Point and Sequin Island) and two state parks (Reid and Popham Beach). Good to know: Every Thursday night the resort hosts a lobster bake from 6-8 p.m. Best for: gourmet tastes Located in a revitalized old mill in Biddeford, just 20 minutes south of Portland, the Lincoln is the town’s first boutique hotel and the only hotel in Maine with a rooftop pool. If seafood is calling, try the lobster gnocchi from on-site restaurant Baston River Brewing and Distilling. Or stop by Fish & Whistle on Main Street for fish (usually local pollock) and chips. To satisfy other cravings: Indian, Vietnamese, Thai, Greek, Mexican, and Mediterranean fare are also within walking distance. Good to know: Plan on a breakfast of buttermilk pancakes from the Palace Diner, a dining car outfitted with 15 counter stools—but arrive early to avoid long lines. Best for: family fun Generations of families have vacationed at this 108-year-old, all-inclusive, summer-camp-like resort on Maine’s arguably most popular lake: Sebago, a 30-minute drive west of Portland. The daily calendar is packed with activities such as pickleball, bingo, or a picnic lunch on a private island. Kid-specific experiences include a boat ride to the candy store and an underwater scavenger hunt.   Good to know: The Friday night Lobster Bake is a guest favorite and a great time to mingle with locals as the dinner is also open to the public. Best for: quiet retreat  Perched on a private peninsula beside South Twin Lake in Millinocket, with Mt. Katahdin as the backdrop, this serene lodge is surrounded by water views. While relaxing is easy, guests can also book moose safaris, sea plane rides, whitewater rafting, and scenic boat rides. Good to know: If you plan on visiting Baxter State Park or hiking Mt. Katahdin, reserve a parking spot in advance as they sell out fast.   (For more tips for what to do in Maine, see our Explorer’s Guide.)

38,Laurel Neme,"Elephants may call each other by name, a rare trait in nature",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/african-elephants-names-communication,"African savanna elephants communicate more like humans than previously thought, new research shows—opening up new possibilities for elephant cognition.",2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"African savanna elephants communicate more like humans than previously thought, new research shows—opening up new possibilities for elephant cognition. Since she started studying African savanna elephants in 1975, biologist Joyce Poole noticed that sometimes an elephant would call out to their kin. Sometimes, a bunch would answer, and other times only one would respond. ""I suspected elephants had a way of directing their calls to specific individuals,"" says Poole, scientific director and co-founder of the nonprofit ElephantVoices, but ""had no idea how one would tease this out."" Now, scientists have published new research in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution that begins to do just that. The study provides evidence that elephants address each other with calls, or names, that are specific to the individual. Names are a rare phenomenon in the animal kingdom, and the few species that use them, such as parrots and dolphins, mimic a sound first made by the recipient. Bottlenose dolphins, for example, broadcast their own signature whistle, which others repeat when addressing them. Elephants seem to do something different: They use arbitrary vocal labels that have nothing to do with sounds or physical properties of the listener. ""We thought this was unique to people,"" says study co-author George Wittemyer, a biology professor at Colorado State University and and chairperson of Save the Elephants' scientific board. From Frida to Rothko In human language, an arbitrary label would be calling a bovine a “cow,” since that word does not resemble, either physically or acoustically, the animal itself. A simpler label, which scientists call an iconic label, would refer to a bovine as a “moo,” since that’s based on and imitates sound the animal makes. Arbitrary labels expand the scope for communication and provide a way of expressing abstract thought—and it’s likely true for elephants, too. “In terms of cognition, that opens all sorts of possibilities,” Wittmyer says. The team drew on both recordings made from 2019 to 2022 in Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve and Buffalo Springs National Reserve, as well as archival recordings from Amboseli National Park in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Poole, a study co-author and National Geographic Explorer, made the Amboseli recordings. In all, the team analyzed data from 101 African savanna elephants making 469 separate calls to 117 recipients. The scientists focused on contact, greeting, and caregiving rumbles, which elephants use when initiating contact with an unseen family member, approaching another in touching distance, and nurturing a calf. These were the types of calls researchers thought were most likely to contain a name. (Learn why both African elephant species are now endangered, one critically.) Elephants produce a range of vocalizations, from trumpets and barks to many types of rumbles. Their structures are complicated. For example, rumbles are low-frequency sounds, partially outside the range of human hearing, that not only vary a lot but can travel through the ground and last anywhere from half a second to 12 seconds. That diversity can contain a lot of information, which makes them challenging to interpret. ""Our data suggest that, unlike human names, where the name itself accounts for most of the variation in the utterance, elephant names account for only a small portion of the variation in the call,"" says study leader Mickey Pardo, a Colorado State University postdoctoral fellow. ""Elephants may cram more information into a single vocalization, so the name might be only one piece of a complex signal that simultaneously conveys other information.” Though researchers don’t know how a name is encoded in a call, this study indicates it is there. Plugging the data into a computer algorithm, researchers found that calls from the same caller to the same receiver were more similar than calls from the same caller to different receivers. Hence, the acoustic structure of calls from a Samburu elephant named Frida to a matriarch, Donatella, were more alike than Frida's calls to other elephants, like her cousin Rothko. This ""indicates that the calls were indeed specific to the individual targeted receiver,"" Pardo says. From Frida to Donatella The researchers' new analysis found contradictory answers as to whether different elephants use the same name to address the same receiver. One of several possible explanations is that different elephants use name derivatives to address the same receiver—somewhat akin to nicknames. (Read: “What are elephants really saying? First-ever library reveals communication mysteries.”) ""Just as the human nicknames Liz, Elizabeth, and Ellie have certain features in common despite being distinct words, it may be that different elephants address the same individual with somewhat similar yet distinct labels,"" Pardo says. Lack of data is an issue, says Tel-Aviv University zoology professor Yossi Yovel, who was not involved in the study. While he finds the topic ""super interesting"" and appreciates the attempt to tease out individually specific calls, he notes that ""there are fewer than 500 calls, which is very little for such a study."" ""For many pairs they have only one caller and one receiver, so it is impossible to learn the ‘name’ of the receiver unless it is consistent across callers,"" he says. ""But they say it is not."" ""For a name to be a name, more than one caller should use it,"" he says, noting that what seem like names can have other explanations. For instance, if someone said “hi hi hi” to one person and “hey hey hey” to another, the algorithm would probably suggest one name is hi and another is hey, Yovel says. ""But this is not the case."" The researchers also conducted field experiments, playing back multiple recordings to the study elephants, with some originally addressed to them and others from the same caller that were not. (See “What elephant calls mean—a user’s guide.”) The findings revealed dramatic reactions, showing that elephants do recognize their own “name,” and respond to it, Pardo says. For instance, when Donatella listened to playback of a call originally addressed to her, she ""called eight times, approached the speaker, and searched behind it.""  But when hearing a recording from Frida to her cousin Rothko, Donatella barely reacted, calling just once and not approaching the speaker. ""We're really in early stages to try and decipher what's going on,"" Wittemyer says.  For instance, Poole wonders if elephants also have names for places. “When they're negotiating a plan of action, you can see them agree or disagree. But what are they saying? Are they saying, 'I'm not going to go with you, I want to go to this other place?’"" she says. ""This study opens a door into how their mind works,"" Wittemyer adds. ""We're making a step to understanding them better, and maybe that will help us live with them better.""

39,Stephen Starr,"Inside the rise of river surfing, the Midwest’s next big thing",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/river-surfing-midwest,"River surfing is gaining popularity in the Midwest, drawing outdoor enthusiasts and spurring economic development in small communities.",2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"River surfing is gaining popularity in the Midwest, drawing outdoor enthusiasts and spurring economic development in small communities. Hannah Ray J has been around rivers her whole life. As a child, she fished and kayaked the waterways close to her family’s farm in Manchester, Iowa. Then, one day, she saw someone standing on a surfboard in the middle of a river in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “I thought: That looks really fun; I want to try that,” she says. In the years since she has turned that chance encounter into her life’s passion: surfing America’s rivers. She’s not alone. River surfing is emerging as the next big thing in outdoor recreation across the Midwest. An urban whitewater park has recently opened in Norfolk, Nebraska, and a surfing area is being planned for Cedar Falls, Iowa, as part of a wider river recreational project. Authorities in West Carrollton, Ohio, are poised to build a large development around a new whitewater river park on the Great Miami River, while a similar project is underway in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These new facilities can potentially attract thousands of river recreators— and their tourist dollars—aiding the economic development of many small, land-locked communities. Some experts have even called river surfing “the future of surfing” due to its fast-growing popularity. Badfish SUP, a Colorado-based paddle and surfboard company, says sales of its river surfboards have rocketed since the pandemic. “We have had far and away our best year ever this year,” says Mike Harvey, its co-owner. “I’ve never seen this level of excitement from any other river-based activity I’ve been in.” The company has even named one of its boards’ Wave Farmer’ as an homage to the people who live and work the landscapes surrounding this emergent activity. Here‘s what you need to know about the rising popularity of river surfing and its potential impact on local communities. River surfing, a niche sport with roots in the 1970s, began in Munich, Germany, on the Eisbach River. Initially an underground activity, it gained popularity as enthusiasts sought alternatives to ocean surfing in landlocked regions. Unlike ocean surfing, where waves come in sets, river waves are constant, allowing surfers to continuously practice and refine their skills without waiting for the next wave. These waves form when fast-moving water flows over a submerged obstacle, like a rock or a constructed feature, causing the water to rise and create a surfable wave that remains fixed. The boards used in river surfing are generally shorter and wider than traditional ocean surfboards, often with more volume to provide buoyancy in freshwater. (Here’s what it’s like to surf the world’s largest waves.) Over the decades, technological advancements in wave generation and surfboard design have transformed river surfing from a fringe activity into a growing mainstream sport. This growing interest is what Laura Hunter, one of the people behind WOKA, a new $33-million whitewater park in northeastern Oklahoma, hopes to see more of. Last month, the eight-feature park opened on the Illinois River, and the public response, she says, has been amazing. “We’ve had north of 4,000 cars in the park to date; it’s more than what we anticipated,” says Hunter. “It’s pretty unreal.” Visitors to WOKA can rent surfboards, kayaks, personal flotation devices (PFDs), and other whitewater gear at the park. WOKA’s website has live webcams so that guests can check wave levels and water conditions ahead of time. What’s been just as exciting, she says, is the community buy-in. “We’re already seeing businesses that support whitewater (activities) coming into the area,” she says. One is Eddyline Kayaks, which is moving its headquarters from Washington State to Siloam Springs, Arkansas, a town linked to WOKA by a three-mile paved trail. Ozark Mountain Trading Company, a local outdoor gear store, has added a ‘WOKA section’ of gear to its website. In some cities, residents have gone farther. In Dayton, Ohio, local surfers unable to travel during the pandemic took their love of surfing and turned it into a thriving business. Communities in Austin, Minnesota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and elsewhere hope to build whitewater parks on their own rivers in the years ahead. While river surfing may be a social and economic boon to Midwestern communities, there are challenges. Trash, storm runoff, and felled tree branches can all impede a good surfing experience or present dangers to surfers. River flows that dictate wave levels can vary daily, and with drought conditions dominating much of the Midwest last summer, low water is a challenge some whitewater parks have had to deal with. Also, like with any activity involving fast-moving water, there are risks. (What happens to the U.S. Midwest when the rivers and lakes dry up? Still, that isn’t deterring most, and new technology to make surfing waves adjustable to changing water heights is coming onstream. What’s more, the broader goal of whitewater parks is to attract more than just surfers: In Oklahoma, WOKA’s eight drops are spread over a 1,200-foot stretch of river and cater to kayakers, tubers, and people who want to watch the fun unfold from the riverbank. Whether you're a seasoned surfer or a beginner looking for a unique water sports experience, river surfing in the Midwest offers an exciting alternative to ocean surfing. While ocean surfing can have a high barrier to entry or offer no more than a couple of seconds of thrill for novices, river surfing waves are constant, meaning once you fall off your board, you can get back on the wave again within a few minutes. You only need your surfboard, helmet, and personal flotation device, says Brandon Burress, who lives in Indiana and regularly plays on the river surfing waves in Dayton, Ohio, a 150-minute round-trip drive from his home. Places like Montrose Beach in Chicago or St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis offer surfing on rivers or lakes. In Chicago, Lake Michigan can create waves for surfing, while in Minneapolis, the Mississippi River’s rapids make for exciting rides. Missoula, Montana, and Sheboygan, Wisconsin, also have spots for river or lake surfing. Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

40,"Gaia Squarci,Avery Schuyler Nunn",Another summer of extreme heat is ahead—and you’ll feel every degree of it,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/heat-temperature-climate-change-sensitivity,A recent study finds that humans are sensitive to even small temperature increases. Researchers hope the findings will influence how we tackle climate change.,2024-06-07T00:00:00Z,"A recent study finds that humans are sensitive to even small temperature increases. Researchers hope the findings will influence how we tackle climate change. In the annals of human history, a subtle but relentless pulse has marked our anthropogenic impact on Earth. Since the industrial revolution dawned in 1850, our planet has steadily warmed each year , with the rate tripling since 1982. By the year 2050, experts estimate we’ll see a 2.7 degree Celsius average temperature rise—and a cascade of ecological repercussions. 2023 etched its fiery signature as the hottest year on record—and forecasts for summer 2024 are already predicting extreme heat across the United States and Europe. And, recent research suggests that you are going to feel every single degree of it.  (Extreme heat can be deadly—here’s how to know if you’re at risk.) According to the study published in the journal Scientific Reports, humans are even more sensitive to temperature shifts than previously thought: Indeed, we can perceive temperature differences as small as 0.9°C with surprising accuracy. “Whether or not you’re aware of it, you are actually sensitive to it biologically,” says Laura Battistel, a cognitive and brain sciences student at the University of Trento who led the study. And that could make a difference in how we tackle climate change. While it's crucial to note that the real impact of temperature shifts lies in how they disrupt environmental and weather systems, Battistel hopes that her research will help people understand just how keenly they really will feel even a one-degree Celsius temperature change due to global warming—which could perhaps inspire them to care about climate change solutions.  Human bodies are meticulously regulated to maintain an internal temperature of around 37 °C, vital not just for physical well-being but also for cognitive processes. Extreme temperatures, whether scorching or freezing, pose significant health risks such as heat stroke or hypothermia. Our evolutionary path has finely attuned us to temperature fluctuations for our survival.  Detecting even minor shifts likely served as an early warning system, prompting actions like seeking shelter, adjusting clothing, and adapting behaviors to stay comfortable.  (How extreme heat can make you sick—and even kill you.) But these adjustments can only go so far. The pace and magnitude of contemporary climate change present unprecedented challenges. Rapidly escalating temperatures, coupled with environmental disruptions, strain our adaptive capacities and require us to take proactive measures to mitigate impacts. Battistel was inspired to research just how attuned we are to temperature changes after noticing a lack of literature on the psychology of it. “There was nothing about it—are we aware of the changes? How good are we at detecting these changes?” In the study, Battistel and her team asked participants to walk between two climate-controlled chambers, which had a maximum difference of two degrees Celsius. What they found was that the participants' response was surprisingly accurate—they were able to detect less than a full degree of temperature change, and more likely than not, guessed that the temperature difference was greater than it was.  “It tells us a story of how disconnected we are from our environment. Our bodies are connected, and yet our awareness is not so connected,” says Battistel.  (See how your city’s climate might change by 2070.) While the researchers note that the study was fairly preliminary and didn’t ask participants which chamber they preferred in terms of comfort,  they emphasize that studies like this one can inform energy models, guiding future energy usage and potentially promoting more sustainable practices. “Our curiosity extends to unraveling how our bodies interpret signals to form our perception of temperature,” says Riccardo Parin, an engineer who co-authored the study.  “This exploration holds the promise of revealing profound insights into the complex processes governing our sensory experiences.”  One thing that’s clear from the scientific literature, Parin says, is that health risks escalate as temperatures rise beyond certain thresholds. “This means we might need to use more and more energy to stay comfortable as temperatures rise,” he says. Parin argues that having a better understanding of human sensitivity to temperature changes could drive advancements in technology for climate control systems, which rely on algorithms to optimize settings based on occupants' comfort levels. This knowledge could allow for the development of highly precise sensors that can detect subtle temperature variations, ultimately leading to more efficient heating and cooling systems in homes.  But while UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain finds the recent research compelling, he notes that the effects on our bodies are hardly the worst part of climate change. “It is interesting that we do seem to be able to perceive pretty small fractions of a degree centigrade differences, which tells us something about perception,” Swain says. “The challenge with extending it to climate change is that the main reason that we’re so worried about degrees of warming is not the actual warming itself—it’s those numbers serving as an indirect indicator of much bigger, more consequential changes that are going to occur and those levels of warming with respect to almost everything else.” (These real solutions could help us fight climate change.) The true climate challenge resides in the broader scope of Earth's interconnected systems. Climate change is already transforming our world, from the rise in extreme weather events like hurricanes and heatwaves to reshaped ecosystems such as coral reefs and Arctic ice. It’s going to take comprehensive solutions like transitioning to renewable energy sources, implementing large-scale reforestation projects, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices to avert the worst impacts. Now we understand how acutely we’re going to feel it—but are we going to take action? Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

41,Antonia Windsor,5 unique ways to discover Jersey’s coastline,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-5-unique-ways-to-discover-jerseys-coastline,"Jersey's varied coast is a playground for sea-lovers, home to sheltered sandy coves ideal for swimming, golden surfing beaches and rugged cliff-top hiking paths.",2024-06-09T00:00:00Z,"Jersey's varied coast is a playground for sea-lovers, home to sheltered sandy coves ideal for swimming, golden surfing beaches and rugged cliff-top hiking paths. There are plenty of ways for visitors to channel their inner seafarer in Jersey, from kayaking, surfing, swimming or simply enjoying the coast on foot. Jersey is the closest Channel Island to France and is small in size, with only nine miles of land east to west and five miles north to south. Yet, its coastal circumference is 43 miles, making it feel like there are more beaches than land. The expanse of Jersey’s coastline is particularly felt when the tide goes out, almost doubling the island’s size twice a day. Whether visitors are seeking adventure, relaxation or exploration, here are five ways to enjoy the island's coastal reaches.  With over 30 beaches and bays — from rocky coves in the north to sweeping sandy beaches in the south — visitors would have to stay on the island for a very long time to swim in all locations. However, a swim has to be planned around the tides as Jersey has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, and when it’s out, it completely disappears from view. If the tide is high in the morning, visitors can head east to sandy Grouville or pebbly Archirondel for a swim. If the tide is high in the evening, a paddle at St Brelade or St Ouen offers the chance to see a spectacular sunset. Cold-water swimming is popular on the island, with many claiming it increases their mental and physical wellbeing. There are plenty of swimming clubs on the island that visitors can join such as the Jersey-based group Dips and Chips, an inspiring female collective that takes to the sea year-round, no matter the weather. Its members share a real sense of camaraderie as they enjoy an invigorating cold-water paddle before catching up afterwards over a warm coffee. Booking a communal session at Sauna Society, a woodfired sauna on St Catherine’s Bay, is another excellent experience for those looking to feel rejuvenated. Visitors get 50 minutes to cycle between a hot sauna, a cold plunge shower or even a refreshing dip in the sea. Whether visitors feel like speeding along the coast in a fast rigid-inflatable boat (RIB) or slowly sailing from bay to bay, a boat tour of Jersey’s coast allows people to see the island from a new perspective. With Jersey Seafaris, a one-hour south coast tour or a one-and-a-half north-coast tour can be booked on its 12-passenger RIB. The tours are packed with local history and information about the island, and visitors may be lucky enough to spot dolphins playfully racing alongside the boat. For those looking for a more laid-back experience, a sunset cruise on the Jersey Duchess is just as enjoyable. The boat travels along the southwest coast to Corbière Lighthouse as the setting sun casts a golden glow over the water. Those looking to splash out can charter Longueville Manor’s luxury yacht Fizz Too, which comes with a seafood lunch, Champagne and a personal steward. Standup paddleboarding (SUP) has become a hugely popular sport in Jersey, with many locals taking to the water to unwind after a day in the office. If visitors want to join them, they can hire an inflatable paddleboard from Windmadness, Absolute Adventures or Jono Watersports in St Brelade’s Bay or from Jersey Adventures at Archirondel. For beginners, a one-hour lesson can be booked with Absolute Adventures, or a SUP yoga session can be booked with Windmadness for the more advanced. For a real taste of island life, visitors can join a SUP evening tour from St Brelade’s Bay to the Portelet Bay Cafe, where they can stop to enjoy a pizza on the beach. If sitting seems more appealing, visitors can try a kayak tour instead. Jersey Adventures has an exhilarating east coast tour from Archirondel to Mont Orgueil Castle and back. Jersey Kayak Adventures and Kayak Nomad also offers sea kayak tours at varying locations around the island, with the departure point confirmed by text the night before. With the heady scent of gorse in the air and the sun bouncing off the granite cliffs, creating twinkles in the sea below, a walk along Jersey’s coastal path is a beautiful experience. Visitors can join the path from one of the northern bays — Rozel or Bouley Bay — and continue to weave around the cliffs or explore one of five self-guided walks on the Visit Jersey website. A tea break is never more than a 40-minute walk away, and the day can be punctuated with refreshing dips in the sea. Jersey is an aspiring UNESCO Geopark, and among the activities the Geopark team organise are wellness sessions at L’Etacquerel Fort on the north coast, where groups can enjoy a yoga class whilst admiring a stunning cliff-top view. Whatever the weather, whatever the season, if there is surf in St Ouen’s Bay (and there usually is), then local surfers will be out catching a wave. The first Jersey Surf Club was set up in 1923, making it among the first in Europe, and the island went on to become a hugely popular surf spot in the 1960s, partly fuelled by local board manufacturing. Photographs that line the walls at surfers’ hang-out, the Watersplash show St Ouen’s Bay packed with surfers gathering to compete in the European surf championships in the late 1960s. Next to the Watersplash, the sea has some of the cleanest breaks on the island, and there are good spots further down the bay, too, at Le Braye and Secrets. The north-coast beaches, such as Grève de Lecq and Plémont, also provide reputable conditions. Jersey has several surf schools for those looking to learn to surf or improve their skills. The Splash Surf Centre, Jersey Surf School, and Laneez Surf School all offer lessons from basic to advanced levels and summer camps for kids.

42,Kerry Walker,9 of the world's most beautiful lakes and what to do there,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/worlds-most-beautiful-lakes-what-to-do,"From swimming to standup paddleboarding, boating to biking, here’s how to have the ultimate adventure on and around six of world’s most beautiful lakes.",2024-06-08T00:00:00Z,"From swimming to standup paddleboarding, boating to biking, here’s how to have the ultimate adventure on and around six of world’s most beautiful lakes. Boosted by a growing awareness of the mental and physical health benefits of wild swimming, lakeside adventures have captured the imaginations of people keen to take the plunge. From glacial Alpine tarns to tropical jungle-wreathed lagoons, lakes can boost moods, reconnect us with the elements and help us to press the reset button. They also offer a wealth of options for intrepid travellers. Whether it’s canoeing across a mountain-clasped lake in Canada’s Rocky Mountains, diving down to a ghostly petrified forest in Kazakhstan, fishing in Finland’s Lakeland as ospreys soar overhead or hiking up to the world’s clearest lake in New Zealand, these activities and excursions promise adventure while simultaneously soothing the soul. 1. Lake Louise, CanadaBest for: canoeing For a taste of Canadian wilderness, few places rival Banff National Park in the Rocky Mountains, where grizzly bears amble through pine and spruce forests, mountains loom overhead and jewel-like lakes dot the landscape — the most scenic of which must be Lake Louise. Hemmed in by rugged, snow-cloaked mountains, this glacier lake sits at 5,200ft, just below Mount Victoria and right on Alberta’s border with British Columbia. While you can admire the lake’s brilliance from its shores, you’ll get a wholly different perspective by grabbing a paddle and canoeing in silent wonder across its waters, your gaze forced upwards to the parade of towering peaks and pearly shimmer of the hanging Victoria Glacier. The startling azure colour of the water can be attributed to light reflecting off small particles of ‘rock flour’ (glacial silt) carried down from glaciers above. 2. Blue Cave, GreeceBest for: subterranean boating Carved over time by the erosive force of the sea, the entrance to the Blue Cave, near the tiny island of Kastellorizo in the Dodecanese, appears almost concealed until one enters its confines. The roof collapsed thousands of years ago following an earthquake, and now when the sun is low, light filtering through the ceiling gives the chamber an otherworldly quality, with intense blue hues reminiscent of an Yves Klein painting. With passengers ducking or lying flat on their backs, tiny boats navigate narrow passages in the rock before a vast chamber reveals itself, its roof reaching heights of 115ft. On hot summer days, the opportunity to swim beneath the cave’s stalactites provides a refreshing escape from the heat. Near the coast of Turkey, the island of Kastellorizo is remote and peaceful, home only to a scattering of dwellings and a few characterful harbourside tavernas. 3. Lake Atitlán, GuatemalaBest for: hiking With volcanoes, waterfall-filled tropical forests and richly cultured Maya villages hugging its shores, Lake Atitlán in Guatemala’s southwestern highlands is a hiker’s paradise. Measuring 1,120ft at its deepest point, the lake fills the crater of an enormous volcano that blew its top around 85,000 years ago. The three volcanoes that guard its shores are ideal for trekking enthusiasts, and the oldest, San Pedro, last erupted around 40,000 years ago. The route to its summit is a five-and-a-half-hour hike that passes coffee plantations and avocado farms to enter cool cloud forest alive with exotic birds like the endangered horned guan. More challenging still is Volcán Tolimán, an ascent of 10,361ft that involves starting at dawn and trekking up forested slopes to a shallow crater and the remains of ancient lava flows. Hardest of them all, however, is 11,598ft-high Volcán Atitlán, one of Guatemala’s most extreme hikes up steep, rugged terrain. The rewards are worth the climb: glimpses of rare birds like the electric blue-green quetzal and phenomenal summit views over Lake Atitlán and a ripple of volcanoes to the Pacific Ocean glimmering in the distance. 4. Lake Kaindy, KazakhstanBest for: diving A drop of turquoise in Kazakhstan’s snow-capped Tian Shan mountains, Lake Kaindy requires an off-road adventure to reach, but it’s worth braving the bumpy ride from the village of Saty, a 35-minute drive away. This 1,300ft-long, 98ft-deep lake was created by a huge earthquake in 1912 that triggered a limestone landslide and formed a natural dam. Fed by a glacial river, this lesser-known star of the Kolsai Lakes National Park looks like something from a Tolkien fantasy. The slender trunks of a submerged Picea schrenkiana (Asian spruce) forest rise from its depths to spear the flawless blue sky. Under the water, it gets more otherworldy still. The frigid, oxygen-rich water has frozen the trees in time, protecting them from decay, while branches swathed in thick curtains of algae create an underwater labyrinth so ghostly locals often refer to it as ‘dead lake’. Due to its altitude and the depth of the water, with divers descending to around 30ft, this is a realm for experts only. While swims are tempting, given the temperature, it’s likely to be a quick plunge: temperatures get to a maximum of 6C even in the summer. In winter, meanwhile, the lake ices over entirely. 5. Lake Päijänne, FinlandBest for: fishing Finland, viewed from above, resembles a tapestry woven from forests and lakes. With almost 190,000 lakes scattered across the country, it’s almost impossible to explore without encountering these sprawling bodies of water. Among them, Lake Päijänne stands out as the second-largest, resembling a fjord nestled within the expansive Finnish Lakeland. Located at the heart of the national park that shares its name, Lake Päijänne stretches for around 80 miles, its waters bordered by ancient spruce, pine and silver birch forests; speckled with islets and sandy esker islands, shaped during the last Ice Age. When the midnight sun burns, Finns come to slip back to nature in lakefront cabins or pitch tents on remote stretches of shoreline. Birds like herons, ospreys and lesser black-backed gulls flock here for the fish, and whether casting lines from the shore, navigating the waters by boat or venturing out to the lake’s numerous islands, fishing enthusiasts, too, are rewarded with the chance to hook prized species such as perch, zander, pike and brown trout. The lake’s reputation as a prime fishing destination is boistered by its rich underwater ecosystem and the surrounding landscape. Don’t miss the chance to swim, with water temperatures rising to 20C in summer. 6. Blue Lake, New ZealandBest for: paddleboarding Lake Tikitapu in the Rotorua Bay of Plenty region on New Zealand’s North Island is known as Blue Lake thanks to its dazzling aqua hue, created by pumice and rhyolite on the lake bed. Skirted by the native bush and exotic redwoods of Whakarewarewa Forest, this volcanic crater lake is steeped in Māori history. Their spiritual connection to the land is profound, and for centuries Tikitapu has been a place of spiritual reverence, where rituals and ceremonies were performed to honour ancestors and seek guidance from the natural world. Visibility is excellent, making Blue Lake an ideal place to swim, but hiring a paddleboard will open up remote reaches of the water. Secluded coves dot its shoreline, as do caves that flicker with glow worms after dark. While paddling, look out for native birds like the tui and fantail flitting through the trees along the shoreline. 7. Lake Constance, EuropeBest for: cycling Straddling Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Lake Constance — or Bodensee, as it’s known locally — is Central Europe’s third-largest freshwater lake, and there’s no better way to see it than by bicycle. The 162-mile Bodensee-Radweg (Lake Constance Cycle Path) makes a spectacular loop of the lake, passing orchards, farms, vineyards, bird-rich wetlands, baroque pilgrimage churches and medieval castles. Stay in historic towns like Konstanz on the northwest shore and break up the pedalling with a swim. Particularly pretty is Hörnle beach; avoid pausing there in July and August, when it’s very crowded. 8. Great Lake of Alqueva, PortugalBest for: stargazing Among the olive groves, cork oak forests, vineyards and snow-white towns of rural Alentejo is Portugal’s Great Lake of Alqueva, Europe’s largest reservoir. Sitting close to the Spanish border, this 97sq-mile lake has beaches and islets to explore by kayak, with castle-topped hill towns to hike to afterwards. The world’s first Starlight Tourism Destination and an official dark sky reserve, Alqueva shines at night. With a pair of binoculars, it’s possible to spot constellations, distant galaxies and meteor showers. For more serious stargazers, use the telescopes at Monsaraz observatory, or opt for a starlit canoe tour. 9. Laguna Colorada, BoliviaBest for: wildlife watching On the Bolivian altiplano, Laguna Colorada is a sight to behold. This shallow, 23sq-mile lake sits 14,035ft above sea level, the pink-red tint of sediment in the water contrasting with the blue skies and snow-streaked volcanoes. Filled with algae and plankton, its mineral-rich waters draw thousands of flamingos, including three of the world’s six species (Chilean, Andean and the rare James’s flamingo). Watch them skim over the water at sunset, with the Andes towering behind. Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

43,"Melissa Hobson,Justin Gilligan",These photos show what happens to coral reefs in a warming world,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/before-and-after-bleaching-lord-howe-coral-reef,Exclusive before and after photos reveal how recent bleaching near Australia’s Lord Howe Island has dramatically changed the region’s coral reefs.,2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"Exclusive before and after photos reveal how recent bleaching near Australia’s Lord Howe Island has dramatically changed the region’s coral reefs. New images, exclusive to National Geographic, show that even remote marine havens aren’t safe from the impact of climate change. Lord Howe Island, a two-hour flight from Sydney, is home to the world’s southernmost coral reef, and its protected waters are a paradise for marine life. This year, researchers were devastated when a double tragedy hit the region’s pristine reefs. Soaring ocean temperatures and record-low tides wiped out many sensitive corals. “It really demonstrates how widespread the impacts of climate change are on our marine ecosystems,” says Bill Leggatt, professor at the University of Newcastle, Australia. Corals are animals that have a mutually beneficial relationship with microalgae called zooxanthellae. The algae live inside the coral and provide it with food in exchange for shelter. It's these zooxanthellae that give coral their stunning colors. But this relationship is fragile. When waters get too warm, even by one or two degrees, corals eject the algae, turning white.  “Corals aren’t like us. They can’t go to the doctor. They can't show a temperature or have a cough. If coral gets stressed, they lose their algae and that’s what coral bleaching is,” says Leggatt. Global sea surface temperatures hit a record high in February 2024.The warming effects of climate change were exacerbated by the El Niño weather pattern that spiked temperatures around the globe. This heat caused the world’s fourth mass bleaching event, with the Great Barrier Reef and reefs across Florida, the Caribbean, the South Pacific, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf all experienced bleaching. The researchers on Lord Howe Island saw this coming. Snorkeling on reefs three to 10 feet deep enabled them to gather baseline data to study the reefs before, during, and after bleaching.  Sea surface temperatures around Lord Howe average around 60.8 degrees Fahrenheit in winter, rising to 78.8°F degrees in summer. They reached a record-breaking 84.2°F degrees during Australia’s most recent summer.  In late January, just before summer temperatures spiked, the reef was pristine. “The colors were incredible,” says Paige Sawyers, PhD student at the University of New South Wales who surveyed the corals. “It was how I pictured the Great Barrier Reef to be about 30 years ago.” The team was shocked when they returned a month later to find the reef had changed beyond recognition. “There was bleaching at every single site,” says Sawyers. “It didn’t feel like the same reef.” As they die, some species of coral glow in highlighter pinks, purples and greens, like a final cry for help. “It’s almost like they put a neon light on,” says Sawyers.  But coral can recover if temperatures drop in time for the algae return to their hosts. As the summer ended and temperatures dropped, things looked promising. “Specific species that had bleached were getting their zooxanthellae back,” says Sawyers. “It looked like everything was going to be OK.” That’s when disaster struck. In May, the island was hit by extremely low tides which left 13 to 15 inches of coral exposed to the air, causing further bleaching, and killing corals that were no longer underwater. “You can actually see a distinct line on some of the coral colonies where the water stopped,” says Sawyers.  The combination of bleaching followed by these unusually low tides was “an unfortunate series of events,” says Leggatt. Very shallow corals naturally encounter low tides but, already stressed by the hot waters, the environmental stress was lethal.  The team is analyzing the data to see the extent of the bleaching but, thankfully, not all Lord Howe’s coral was lost.  “Once they’re dead, they’re dead. There's no coming back from that,” says Sawyers. As winter arrives, the experts are already seeing signs of recovery as the corals regain their color.  But Leggatt remains concerned by the extent of the recent bleaching on an island that is so isolated from other human impacts. With climate change causing increasingly severe bleaching events, these precious ecosystems are under threat. Losing them would have huge impacts on the environment and the people who rely on them for their food and livelihoods. While small-scale restoration efforts can help on a local scale, the problem is too vast for these interventions to provide a global solution. “If you said to people, we’re going to lose the Amazon in 10 to 15 years, the solution wouldn't be to try and bank trees and replant the Amazon,” says Leggatt. “It has to come from stopping the large impact, stopping climate change.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

44,Sarah Gibbens,Birth control options for men are advancing. Here’s how they work.,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/male-contraceptives-birth-control-explained,"From gels and pills to implants, the contraceptive choices accessible to most men may soon expand beyond condoms and vasectomies.",2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"From gels and pills to implants, the contraceptive choices accessible to most men may soon expand beyond condoms and vasectomies. When hormonal contraceptive pills hit the market in the 1960s, it revolutionized women’s control over their own bodies. The pill gave women the freedom to choose when they want to start a family, but unintended pregnancies are still common. Nearly half of the pregnancies that occur every year are unintended, both in the U.S. and around the world. Could a contraceptive for men help?  We might find out in the next decade. Scientists are successfully experimenting with pills, gels, and implants that would allow men to share contraceptive responsibility with women. Many are more convenient and foolproof than condoms or easily reversed than vasectomies, and some are being developed without the hormones that typically cause bothersome side effects for women.  “I see it as a huge shift in equity, ” says Heather Vadhat, the executive director of the Male Contraceptive Initiative, an organization that funds contraceptive research. Understanding how these new birth control methods work requires a refresher on the male reproductive system.    For men, successful reproduction begins with the right cocktail of hormones, notably testosterone. They signal the body to start producing sperm, a process called spermatogenesis. It takes about 74 days for sperm to develop and mature, a regeneration process that’s constantly taking place after a man reaches puberty. Mature sperm are stored in the testes, a reserve of reproductive material that’s regularly restocked.  When a man ejaculates, more than 250 million sperm leave the testicles and begin their hunt for an egg to fertilize. If they find themselves inside a vagina, the best swimmers propel themselves forward, through the vagina, past the cervix, and into the uterus where, if they stumble upon a healthy, fertile egg, they lead to conception.  While modern female birth control uses hormones to disrupt the process that produces one to two fertile eggs a month, male birth control must stop millions of sperm in their tracks.  Hormones are being used to stop the male reproductive process by specifically targeting spermatogenesis, slowly shutting down the sperm production process.  Early clinical trials are showing promising results from a topical gel applied daily to the shoulders. More than 200 men applied the gel daily, and after 15 weeks, 86 percent had sperm counts low enough to make the gel an effective contraceptive. The gel contains a synthetic female hormone called progestin that lowers testosterone, a male reproductive hormone, to a level where sperm production is inhibited. As the gel is absorbed into the skin, small amounts remain just underneath, slowly releasing contraceptive hormones that make the man infertile for as long as he continues to use the gel.  The gel also contains a small amount of testosterone that’s added back into the body to maintain mens' other normal body functions.  One 2012 clinical trial tested the gel in 99 men and found that almost 90 percent of them experienced temporary infertility. Participants reported side effects similar to female hormonal birth control, such as weight gain, acne, low libido, and mood swings. Hormonal gels are already used to treat hormone deficiencies, which is one reason the method is appealing to researchers—they know men are already willing to use the application method. Future trials will test the gel's safety and reversibility. Vasectomies are another option for male birth control. They have been performed since the late 19th century, but became more popular during the 20th. The procedure is named for small tubes in the scrotum called the vas deferens. When sperm leaves the testes, it travels down these tubes and mixes with semen. Vasectomies work by blocking this pathway in the vas deferens, preventing the sperm from leaving the body. Often doctors will surgically insert a special clip to block the tubes, or they might cut and tie the vas deferens tubes directly.  In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ensured women could access abortion care, doctors have seen an increase in men looking for vasectomies.  “One of the things we’re seeing is men thinking they can reverse vasectomies when they want,” says Vahdat. “But a vasectomy is pretty straightforward, and reversal is not.”  Depending on how the vasectomy is reversed, there’s anywhere from a 60 to 90 percent chance fertility can be regained, but the process requires surgery and success isn’t guaranteed. There may be new options on the horizon. Vahdat is excited about a company called Contraline that injects a gel into the vas deferens. The gel is meant to block sperm, just like traditional vasectomies, but over time the gel liquifies and is absorbed into the body. The gel is in early clinical trials in Australia, and the participating men will be evaluated for the next three years. After sperm are produced, tunneled through the vas deferens, and deposited in the vagina, they must still swim their hearts out to successfully cause a pregnancy.  But a study published earlier this year in Nature Communications shows promise for an “on-demand” contraceptive pill that could be taken about 30 minutes before intercourse and whose effects would wear off after about a day. The drug works by targeting an enzyme called Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), essentially the “on switch” that tells sperm to start swimming. When that enzyme is suppressed, sperm can’t get any farther than the vagina.  “They’ll be immotile; they’ll just sit there and twitch,” says Lonny Levin, a pharmacologist at Weill Cornell and one of the study’s authors.  When an experimental drug was given to mice, they were infertile after 15 minutes. Two hours later, their fertility returned to normal.  “I said holy mackerel this is the holy grail. This is a male contraceptive,” Levin says.  After about an hour inside the vagina, the sperm die and pregnancy is averted.  Levin and his research partners hope to test these enzyme blockers on humans in the next two to three years and think it could still be a decade until those trials produce results that ready the pill for market. “There was a stereotype that men won’t use [birth control], and women won’t trust them,” says Vahdat.  But a survey shared at a World Health Organization webinar in September 2022 (seen in a recording here) suggests that’s not entirely true. A global survey of 5,000 men who have sex with women showed many were interested in trying a contraceptive. The least enthusiastic participants were found in the U.S.—about 40 percent of men in the U.S. said they would try birth control in the next year. And the most excited were in Nigeria—nearly 80 percent of men said they were interested in taking a new form of male contraception.  Steve Kretschmer, executive director of consulting firm DesireLine, conducted the survey. He said countries where women’s contraceptives were already common had men who were slightly less interested in taking birth control. But overall, in all countries surveyed, men's interest increased over time.  His data also showed that a majority of women in each country said they would believe their male partner if he told them they were taking birth control.  Vahdat is eager for these new contraceptives, reproductive advancements that have been a long time coming. Among her peers, she says, there’s a running joke that birth control for men has been “a couple years away for 50 years.” But, she adds, it finally feels within reach.  When male birth control is widely available, Vahdat expects it to dramatically reframe how we think about reproduction and who’s responsible for it.  “We just don’t think of men as contraceptive beings. It’s so synonymous with female autonomy,” she says. “I feel confident it’s going to be game-changing.”  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

45,Nina Elkadi,How the humble soybean took over the world,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/soybeans-took-over-world-food-agriculture,"Used in China as early as 9,000 years ago, soybeans are found in everything from candy to crayons today.",2024-06-10T00:00:00Z,"Used in China as early as 9,000 years ago, soybeans are found in everything from candy to crayons today. Soy is found in almost everything we eat—from the vegetable oil in store-bought hummus, to the lecithin found in chocolate bars; it’s in the mono- and diglycerides in hot chocolate packets and the coating on the outside of apples.  More than 60 percent of all processed foods contain soy products, and some researchers estimate that approximately seven percent of the calories Americans consume come from soybean oil alone. While it may seem like humans chose the soybean, it was arguably the soybean—hardy and malleable—that chose people. Soybeans have an innate ability to grow almost anywhere and survive almost anything. The green plant grows anywhere from three to five feet tall and produces around 100 beans per plant. Soy can be grown everywhere from the extremely harsh four seasons of Manitoba, Canada, to the grassland savannah of Mpumalanga, South Africa.  Soy was likely domesticated in China approximately 6,000 to 9,000 years ago from its wild relative, Glycine soja. Because soybeans grew so heartily, even during extreme periods of drought, the first soy farmers found several uses for the bean. Thousands of years ago, ancient Chinese medical healers described using all parts of the plant as medicine. People also turned soy into noodles, tofu, tempeh, and soy sauce. When soybeans first made landfall in the 18th century United States, they flourished. They were likely first planted by the surveyor general of Georgia, Henry Yonge, who noted that soybeans yielded “three crops: and had the [frost] kept off one week longer, I [should] have had a fourth crop.” Soybeans were initially planted to be sent to England to meet rising demands for soy sauce, which was becoming a staple in British cuisine. It would not be long, though, before Americans found another use for the bean. During the Civil War, roasted soybeans were used as coffee substitutes. One report in an 1893 issue of The Rural New Yorker said that soy coffee “is for those who desire a substitute for economy and health considerations.” Soon, soybeans would become the staple feed in the diets of non-human creatures, too. Such a small bean can provide a lot of sustenance for animals and humans. One cup of raw soybeans contains 67.9 grams of protein and 17.3 grams of fiber. This is one reason why soybeans are one of the most popular ingredients in animal feed. In the U.S., chickens eat the most soy, followed by pigs, cows, and fish. These animals eat over 70 percent of all soybeans grown in the U.S., with some pigs eating over ten pounds of soy per day. For humans, soy-based products such as tofu and tempeh are staples for vegans and vegetarians. One cup of cooked tofu has more almost the exact same amount of protein as one cup of cooked chicken. Soy is also unique in that is considered a “complete protein,” meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that the humans body needs. The versatile legumes are soft, odorless, malleable, and oily, especially compared to corn. They’re also cheap and found in surprising products like crayon wax and newspaper ink. Henry Ford, the prolific inventor of the Model T car, believed that the versatile soybean had the power to change the world. He made house paint, soap, and enamel for cars from soybean oil. He turned the bean itself into car parts and light switches. Historian Greg Grandin describes how Ford held “soy banquets,” which featured “puree of soybean, soybean crackers, soybean croquettes with tomato sauce, buttered green soybeans, pineapple rings with soybean cheese, soybean bread with soybean butter, apple pie with soy crust, roasted soybean coffee, and soymilk ice cream.”  Today, people are still finding unique uses for the plant. China, the humble home of the soybean, now leads the way in soybean imports.  Almost all soybeans grown in the U.S. are genetically modified (GM), meaning the plants are resistant to herbicides and can thrive in conditions once thought to be impossible for the legume. However, genetic modification also means that massive quantities of soybeans can be planted in regions of the world, like the Amazon rainforest, where they are replacing the trees that once stood there. Brazil now exports more soybeans than any other country.  As global demand for meat increases, demand for feed— and soybeans —rises too. Some advocacy groups are calling for better land-use practices to safeguard the rainforest and the soil. In 2023, policies brought on by new governments in South America began slowing rates of deforestation in the Amazon. Still, Brazil is by far the largest exporter of soybeans, and many growers have expanded their soy operations to the cerrado, a savannah-like region of Brazil. Despite changing policies and practices around deforestation, this year is expected to be a record year for soybean production.

With 3,500 miles of coastline, 6,000 lakes and ponds, 17 million forested acres, and 14 peaks over 4,000 feet, Maine has lots of options for families to get active outdoors. Here are 10 experiences that reveal the New England state’s natural and wild wonders.   The nation’s easternmost national park, Acadia is one of the first places in the United States to see the sunrise. If your crew aren’t early risers, don’t worry. The view from atop Cadillac Mountain is stunning any time of day. A car trip along the Park Loop Road gets you there, weaving through the park’s forested interior, edging the rugged granite shoreline, passing lakes and ponds, then zigzagging up 1,350-foot-high Cadillac, the highest peak on the Eastern Seaboard. You’ll need a timed reservation to drive to the summit, so plan ahead. For the best experience, hit the road by 8 a.m. to be ahead of the crowds. Along the way, perhaps hike one of the many trails (Gorham Mountain Loop is a moderate family hike), and enjoy tea and popovers on the waterfront lawn of the Jordan Pond House. Acadia provides detailed information on park accessibility for those with cognitive, mobility, hearing, or vision challenges. Sprawling over 300-plus acres, the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens comprises specialty gardens, natural areas, and woodlands, where five Guardian of the Seeds trolls await discovery. These giant trolls, created by Thomas Dambo from recycled wood, inhabit the woodlands surrounding the gardens and guard 10 secret seeds. Find the trolls, and you’ll learn their stories about conservation and the importance of biodiversity. Ask for the troll map at the front desk. One troll is accessible, but the others are located in the woodlands. Allow 45 minutes to see one or two, more if you want to follow clues to the secret seeds. If there’s time, stroll the central gardens, especially the interactive, storybook-themed children’s and sensory gardens. Tom Martin of Lucky Catch Lobster Tours has been lobster fishing since 1984. He knows Casco Bay’s waters extensively and loves sharing them with visitors. He takes passengers out on cruises to see lighthouses, islands, forts, seals, and seabirds. They’re also invited to help pull, empty, and bait traps. On the 90-minute excursions, passengers learn everything they might want to know about lobsters. Any of the crustaceans caught can be bought for boat price and cooked at a nearby lobster shack for a nominal fee after docking. Wheelchair-accessible Maine Wildlife Park is a state-operated refuge that provides a temporary or permanent home for orphaned or injured wildlife, including moose, black bear, bald eagle, bobcat, and cougar. In addition to seeing the animals, families can feed brook trout for a quarter at the fish hatchery, learn about the various Maine trees on the Tree Trail, and find hidden animal cutouts along the Game Trail. The park is located about 35 minutes’ drive north of Portland and 30 minutes west of Freeport. One of New England’s best preserved coastal fortifications, Fort Knox protected the Penobscot River Valley during the Civil and Spanish-American Wars—though the sprawling fort never actually saw battle. “The fort cost a million dollars during its life span, yet it never fired a shot in anger, nor was it shot upon. The best weapon you can buy is the one you never have to use,” quips park manager Dean Bennet. The fort is an architectural masterpiece, with granite walls, dry moats, spiral stairs, batteries, and magazines. Of note are two rare 15-inch Rodman cannons, which weigh a massive 49,000 pounds each. Wear good footwear and bring a flashlight to explore the rooms, halls, and underground passageways. After walking through history, head nearby to the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, which features a 42-floor observatory that provides visitors head-swiveling views from the coast to the mountains. Both attractions are about a half-hour south of Bangor. Join diver and Smithsonian marine ecologist Ed Monat, aka Diver Ed, and his boat-captain wife, Edna, aka Captain Evil, aboard the purpose-built Starfish Enterprise Dive-In Theater boat. You’ll cruise to a spot near the Porcupine Islands, where the boat anchors. Diver Ed dons scuba gear, and then kids push him—and his 3-inch-tall toy sidekick Mini Ed—overboard. Those on board watch their undersea adventures on a movie screen, while Captain Evil narrates. Diver Ed and Mini Ed return to the boat with sea critters they have found: starfish, sea cucumbers, crabs, lobster. Everyone can examine the marine life before they’re returned to the sea. The boat departs from the College of the Atlantic Pier in Bar Harbor. Maine has more moose than any other state except Alaska. Most of the state’s 60,000-70,000 moose reside in northern Maine, and Greenville, where moose outnumber people three to one, is a good bet for seeing one. Despite standing up to 7 feet tall and averaging 800-1,100 pounds, moose can be hard to spot. Joining a moose safari led by a professional Maine guide increases the odds. Northwoods Outfitters in Greenville, about 2.5 hours north of Portland, offers tours by water via canoe or kayak or on land by van. The wheelchair-accessible Casco Bay Lines mail boat hopscotches five Casco Bay islands delivering passengers, mail, and freight. During the three-hour narrated cruise, the captain points out forts and lighthouses, and visitors will see lobstermen hauling traps out of the water. Look out for seals and seabirds as you spend the day getting a sense of island life by watching passengers and cargo loading and off-loading. Bring sunscreen, beverages, and snacks. Reasonable modifications are made for those with hearing, speech, or visual challenges. The gentle Saco River weaves through the woodlands and farmlands of Fryeburg, 70 minutes northwest of Portland. “It’s not unusual to spy a bald eagle,” says Beth Griffin. She is a second-generation member of the Westburg family, owners of Saco River Canoe & Kayak, which has helped visitors explore this river for over 50 years. “If you want to enjoy the serenity of the river, come Monday through Thursday when it’s quieter,” she says. The river’s lazy current does most of the work, making it ideal for a two- to six-hour leisurely paddle with beach breaks for picnicking or swimming. The paved 1.6-mile Spring Point Shoreway edges the South Portland waterfront and delivers outstanding views of the Harbor and Casco Bay’s islands. Start at Portland Breakwater Light (nicknamed Bug Light) in Bug Light Park, which features a sculpture with interpretive signage commemorating where 236 World War II cargo-carrying Liberty Ships, which contributed to the World War II Allied victory, were built. The trail eases around a marina to Spring Point, where you can walk out a rocky breakwater to Spring Point Ledge Lighthouse and scramble around the ruins of adjacent 1808 Fort Preble. Continue along the shorefront, passing Southern Maine Community College’s campus, to sandy Willard Beach, and dip your toes in Atlantic waters before returning. Lighthouse Bikes offers rental bicycles and guided tours. (For more tips for what to do in Maine, see our Explorer’s Guide.)

47,Andrea Cooper,Can trauma be inherited through genes?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/trauma-genes-inherit-epigenetics-methylation,"A life-altering experience “doesn’t just die with you,” one expert says. “It has a life of its own afterwards.”",2024-06-12T00:00:00Z,"A life-altering experience “doesn’t just die with you,” one expert says. “It has a life of its own afterwards.” Emerging science suggests that the effects of trauma—from war and genocide to abuse and environmental factors—could be genetically passed down from one generation to another. Epigenetics is the study of how genes are turned off and on. The molecular process, known as gene expression, boosts the activity of some genes and quiets others by adding and removing chemical tags—called methyl groups—to genes. Multiple research studies have suggested that this may be a mechanism through which a parent’s trauma could be imprinted in the genes of offspring, and the epigenetic effects could be multi-generational. The field ""touches on all the questions that humanity has asked since it was walking on this planet,"" says Moshe Szyf, a professor of pharmacology at McGill University. ""How much of our destiny is predetermined? How much of it do we control?""                                                                                     For some people, the concept that we can carry a legacy of trauma makes sense because it validates their sense that they are more than the sum of their experiences. “If you feel you have been affected by a very traumatic, difficult, life-altering experience that your mother or father has had, there’s something to that,” says Rachel Yehuda, professor of psychiatry and neuroscience of trauma at Mount Sinai in New York. Her research points to a small epigenetic “signal” that a life-altering experience “doesn’t just die with you,” she says. “It has a life of its own afterwards in some form.”  To understand how emotional trauma can transcend generations, consider the distinction between the genome—the body’s full complement of DNA—and the epigenome. Isabelle Mansuy, professor in neuroepigenetics at the University of Zürich, likens it to the difference between hardware and software. You need the genome “hardware” to function. But it is epigenetic “software” that instructs how genes in the genome should behave. “All the time, in every cell, every moment, the epigenome is changing,"" Mansuy says. It responds to all sorts of environmental factors, from chemical exposures to nutritional deficiencies. The epigenome determines which genes will be activated at a given time and which will remain silent. Yehuda uncovered an epigenetic mark in Holocaust survivors and their offspring, a group at greater risk for mental health challenges. She assessed 32 survivors and their adult children in 2015, examining the FKBP5 gene—which has been linked to anxiety and other mental health concerns.                                            By extracting DNA from blood samples, the team identified epigenetic changes in the same region of the gene in the survivors and their children; but those alterations were not present in the DNA of a small group of Jewish parents and their offspring who lived outside of Europe and didn’t experience the Holocaust. In a subsequent study published in 2020, Yehuda examined a larger cohort of subjects, looking at variables such as the sex and age of the parent during the Holocaust. She examined DNA methylation, one of the methods the epigenome uses to activate or quiet genes. DNA methylation generally adds a chemical mark to DNA; demethylation removes it. Yehuda found that there were lower levels of DNA methylation in the FKBP5 gene in children whose mothers survived the Holocaust than in Jewish control subjects whose parents didn’t experience the Holocaust. Some studies have linked reduced DNA methylation in the FKBP5 gene to increased risk of disorders in adults such as PTSD. The results suggested that a mother’s trauma—even if it occurred during childhood—might lead to epigenetic changes within the DNA in her eggs and thus impact the mental health of her children. A 2019 study with male Vietnam war veterans from Australia provides additional clues about how trauma transcends generations. Researchers searched for methylation differences in the DNA encapsulated in the sperm of veterans suffering from PTSD and compared it to DNA of those without the condition. Ten regions of DNA showed different methylation patterns in PTSD veterans compared to non-PTSD veterans. The changes were present in nine different associated with psychiatric disorders such as PTSD.  The methylation patterns in the vets with PTSD were linked with mental health conditions diagnosed in the veterans' children, according to the study. The findings identified a unique pattern of DNA changes which could be inherited, “especially those that are associated with the stress response,” says Divya Mehta, senior research fellow at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Given humans’ long  lifespan and length of time to produce offspring, it’s far easier for researchers to explore inherited trauma in mice or rats, which produce multiple litters a year. In a series of experiments to understand how animals might transmit information about an ancestral trauma to their offspring, Brian Dias, associate professor in the University of Southern California’s developmental neuroscience and neurogenetics program, exposed mice to a chemical that smelled like cherry blossoms and paired that scent exposure with a mild electric shock. The mice, naturally, learned to fear the odor. The next two generations of mice startled when they smelled the scent though they had never been exposed to it before. Dias later repeated the experiment with another chemical that smelled like almonds. This time, a subgroup of mice experienced the combination of odor and shock; later they were exposed to the odor without the shock. Over time, these mice no longer interpreted the odor as a threat. Their offspring didn’t fear the odor, either. “Inheritance” does not mean the children will always show the same signs of trauma as the parent. In several studies, University of Zürich’s Mansuy has investigated epigenetic effects caused by the separation of mice mothers and their pups; with the mothers also exposed to stressors during the separations. How could a stressful environment such as separation from the mother set off epigenetic changes in pups? We don’t know exactly, Mansuy acknowledges. The mechanism linking stress and the epigenome in brain and other cells “is not well understood.” Still, the study found that the pups and their descendants exhibited depression, memory deficits, and risk-taking behaviors, such as an inability to evaluate potential dangers, among many behavioral changes. While the depression and memory decline extended to the third generation, the risk-taking started to diminish only after the fifth generation. “It’s remarkable that some of the symptoms stay for so long,” Mansuy says. When the symptoms lessened, Mansuy found that the DNA methylation was altered in the male offspring’s sperm and brain. Trauma extends beyond devastating events such as child abuse or war. An insult to DNA can also be triggered through environmental causes. One early study in 2005 investigated whether exposure to the agricultural fungicide vinclozolin could affect the sex of offspring in pregnant rats. It didn’t. However, when the male offspring turned about a year old, researchers noticed that a high percentage of these animals’ sperm cells were dying. The same thing happened to the next three generations, though only the pregnant mothers had been exposed to vinclozolin. It was the “first observation of non-genetic inheritance,” says Michael Skinner, study investigator and founding director of the Center for Reproductive Biology at Washington State University. Skinner and colleagues observed altered patterns of DNA methylation. “The sperm had an epigenetic shift and was carrying it to the next generation."" Skinner later tested rats’ exposure to an herbicide called glyphosate. The chemical did not harm the rats’ offspring. But the third and fourth generation (the grandchildren and great-grandchildren) displayed a higher incidence of prostate, kidney, and ovarian disease, along with obesity and birth abnormalities. Examination of the sperm revealed alterations in the DNA methylation linked with higher incidence of disease. The research suggested that though it skipped one generation, the effects of glyphosate passed epigenetically to future generations. If these studies sound worrying, preliminary evidence suggests it may be possible to reverse some epigenetic changes.  Mansuy and colleagues hypothesized that an enriched environment could lessen trauma-associated behavior. In several experiments, she placed adult mice that had been traumatized early in life into cages with many other mice, running wheels, toys, and a maze. Compared to traumatized mice in a standard enclosure, traumatized mice who then lived in the more stimulating setting didn’t show the symptoms of trauma behavior. Their offspring didn’t, either. Mansuy saw differences in the glucocorticoid receptor gene, which helps regulate the body’s response to stress, between the mice who benefitted from enrichment and those that didn’t. The results suggested the epigenetic effects of trauma had been corrected. While the study examined only this gene, Mansuy has extended her studies to additional genes and expects to release new data soon. Szyf found it was possible to reverse the effects of DNA methylation in rats who were anxious because of poor maternal care. Once they reached adulthood, he injected the rats with a drug—trichostatin A—and observed the mice showed fewer signs of stress and “started behaving like animals that were not subjected to this kind of early life adversity,"" he says. The drug also caused DNA demethylation, or removal of tags, in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that Mansuy was studying. Some research suggests that even exercise can influence the epigenome. Skinner studied 70 pairs of identical human twins who agreed to have their level of exercise monitored. The more physically active twins experienced lower rates of obesity and metabolic disease. Their epigenome also changed. The twins who exercised more had chemical tags on their genes linked to lower metabolic syndrome. “All environmental factors, from toxicants to diet to exercise to climate change” impact health through epigenetics, Skinner says. While it’s easy to focus on the negative aspects of potentially inheriting the effects of trauma, epigenetic changes also may help future generations by activating genes to help offspring cope with adversity. “That’s what I think happens,” Yehuda says. “But it depends. If you’re not living in adversity, you might become hypervigilant. And if you’re living in adversity, you might have a skill set to survive it that is honed from life lessons of the past somehow.” With the rise of technologies such as next generation sequencing that allow researchers to analyze types of cells and how they respond to stressors, “we’re now in a gilded age” of exploration, according to Dias. His current research explores how many sperm are marked before the effects of trauma are transmitted, how enduring these marks are, and how embryos may bear imprints of a trauma. How we might inherit the effects of our parents’ or ancestors’ traumas is a story that is just starting to be told. Some scientists are not convinced by the evidence so far. “I don’t think any studies have met the standard of proof to say that this is plausibly happening in mammals,” says John Greally, chief of genomics and professor of genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He worries these studies actually “worsen the damage” because they can make people from communities with multi-generational trauma, such as Native Americans, “feel like they are intrinsically damaged and there’s nothing they can do about it,” while distracting from ways to address the real-world causes of traumas. Other critics have observed that many DNA methylation marks on genes are removed when human sperm and egg unite. There are research papers, Dias notes, which showed some genes come through that process with marks intact. Still, he’s among those who agree more work needs to be done to demonstrate the transmission mechanisms. What’s clear is that humankind has learned to navigate the effects of traumas, inherited or not, or we wouldn’t still exist. Resilience is the more dominant trait, Szyf says, “otherwise we would not survive as a race.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

For any athlete, the moment the starting gun fires represents the moment when all their efforts of weeks, months, and years of training come together with critical focus. It is when every athlete needs to be at their peak physical and mental fitness—with their unique and individual definitions of health underpinning their performance and success. To support Picture of Health, six Bupa athlete ambassadors share their inspirational stories and explore what “health” means to them. “My Picture of Health is independence. Being happy, being fit, and being able to do the things I want to do,” says Australian Para canoeist and former soldier, Curtis McGrath. A mine blast in Afghanistan took both of Curtis’s legs, changing his life forever. “On the stretcher,” he recalls, “I said, ‘I’ll see you guys in the Paralympic Games’; and it wasn’t a promise, it was more a statement of hope.” Less than two years later, Curtis broke a world record and won the 200-meter VL2 world title in Moscow. He has since taken home 14 gold medals and one silver, including consecutive golds at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. “It's amazing to be in Paris,” he says. “It’s just another line in my story of how far I’ve come since lying on the ground in Afghanistan. Now I’m here and it's exciting.” “For me to be healthy, I need to be in a mental and physical state which allows me to develop and grow as a person. My Picture of Health is self belief,” explains Chilean archer Mariana Zúñiga. “This means I can be at my best in both life and my sport.” Mariana was born with myelomeningocele, a form of spina bifida. “I first began archery when I was 10 years old after watching the movie Brave,” she explains. “And today I’m on a beautiful journey in sport.” When she won a silver medal, her achievement was celebrated across the continent as the first archer from the Americas to win in her category. “For me, being brave means facing obstacles,” she says. “Feeling all of the fear and emotions, but at the same time facing the challenges that life throws at me.” “My Picture of Health is the strength to overcome difficulties that seemed impossible at first,” says Polish shot put and club throw athlete, Róża Kozakowska. “In my case, impossible doesn’t exist.” Róża’s nervous system was attacked after a tick bite and she developed articular and cerebral neuroborreliosis, a condition which impacts her coordination. “I woke up one morning and just felt I was paralyzed,” she recalls. “But I never gave up, I believed in myself, and this is how my adventure in sports for disabled people began.” Róża not only won a gold medal in Tokyo 2020, but she also set a new world record and was named Poland’s 2021 Disabled Athlete of the Year. “Developing my physical fitness takes time, it is a hard, thorough process,” she emphasizes. But it’s worth it. “Without health, life is gray, boring, devoid of all color. It is the most important thing.” “My Picture of Health is determination,” declares Richard Whitehead, MBE, and British runner. From an early age, Richard learned to live life without limits, becoming the first double amputee to run the length of Great Britain—40 marathons in 40 days for charity. Since winning two Paralympic gold medals for the 200 meters, Richard has devoted his energy to using the power of sport for the benefit of disabled people. “Probably my greatest achievement was accepting my disability as not a negative, but as a positive,” he says. “An opportunity to show people that anything is possible; to represent a community that maybe didn’t have representation when I was growing up.” “My Picture of Health is energy,” says British Para athlete Emmanuel Oyinbo-Coker. “I say energy because it’s quite similar to health in terms of how contagious it is. If someone is in good health, they would tend to promote good health habits,” he explains. Missing his lower left arm, Emmanuel’s running skill was spotted by a teacher. “I came second out of all the schools in my council,” he recalls, and he was encouraged to take running seriously by following a Para athlete pathway. “I’m representing Great Britain; I’ve won a Commonwealth gold medal. And yeah, the Paralympic medal is the next one to come,” he smiles. “Sleeping good, eating good, exercising, drinking lots of water, if you have good energy, you’re feeling buzzy, you’re feeling happy,” he says. “That ability to influence others through how you’re feeling is very helpful.” “My picture of health is tranquility,” explains Sara Andrés Barrio, Spanish sprinter and long jumper. “Because when your health is good, you’re whole, in peace, at ease with yourself.” Sara lost her feet in an accident, but she seized what she saw as a second chance and took up sport to become more agile. “I realized I loved athletics. It became my passion, and now my profession.” A finalist in Rio, and having won double bronze and silver medals at the World Para Athletics Championships, Sara has a clear focus on health. “I think having good health is the main thing, right?” she asks. “To be able to enjoy life, to be fully calm knowing that everything is fine in your body and mind, to be able to enjoy the things that really matter, right?” These extraordinary athletes have been photographed by world-renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz as part of Bupa's Picture of Health campaign. This aims to start a conversation about what health is, and what it can be—using this series of dynamic and striking photos to inspire people to share their own pictures of health. From strength and independence to family and self-belief, these photos are just the beginning. “I’m very happy to belong to this group,” considers Sara. “I hope Annie captures our feelings very well: our positivity, our tenacity, our resilience. And that these superpowers will be forever remembered.” From the mental to the physical, dive even deeper into these athletes’ Picture of Health.

49,Brian Handwerk,What is kratom? The risks and benefits of the herbal product,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/kratom-health-risks-benefits,"Touted as an energy booster and mood enhancer, kratom is ubiquitous in convenience stores and gas stations across the U.S. So why does the FDA list it as a “drug of concern”?",2024-06-13T00:00:00Z,"Touted as an energy booster and mood enhancer, kratom is ubiquitous in convenience stores and gas stations across the U.S. So why does the FDA list it as a “drug of concern”? Kratom might be the most popular herbal product you’ve never heard of. Almost two million Americans used kratom in 2021, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Although it is banned in seven states kratom is ubiquitous at U.S. gas stations, convenience stores, and online. Sourced from an Asian tree’s leaves, kratom produces weak opioid-like effects. It’s touted as an energy-boosting stimulant, a euphoric mood enhancer that can help anxiety or depression, and a treatment for chronic pain. But does it really work? Is it safe?  “It’s amazing how little information is out there given how many people use it,” says Peter Grinspoon, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. (5 things you should know before trusting that supplement.) Kratom leaves and teas have been used for centuries in Southeast Asia, but the products consumed in the United States are quite different and often far more potent. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists kratom as a “drug of concern,” citing addiction and side effects like seizures, liver toxicity and, in rare cases, even death. Other adverse reactions to kratom use can include drowsiness, confusion, vomiting, or racing heartbeats. Yet because it’s not a food, dietary supplement, or drug, kratom has a nebulous regulatory status and can be sold in many places to those as young as 13. Underlying this uncertainty is a lack of peer-reviewed research. “We really don’t have a scientific understanding of the safety or the efficacy of the product,” says Christopher McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Florida who has studied kratom use for over a decade. The kratom tree (Mitragyna speciosa) is an evergreen in the coffee family, grown in Southeast Asia where fresh leaves are chewed as a mild stimulant, and teas are brewed as medicine to treat pain, diabetes, diarrhea, and other ailments including opium withdrawal. In the U.S., kratom is sold in dried, powdered form that’s typically brewed in tea or taken in capsules. Gummies and liquid kratom doses are also sold, often with very high potency.   (4 herbal traditions used every day, all over the world.) Among kratom’s many chemically active compounds is mitragynine, which targets the same pain-reducing receptors that are stimulated by opioids like heroin, morphine, and fentanyl.  Another key compound is alkaloid 7-hydroxymitragynine, which has far more potent opioid-like impacts. Kratom plants contain very small amounts of 7-hydroxymitragynine but the amounts vary wildly in kratom supplements—some of which are adulterated with artificially high levels of this more addictive compound. Kratom also binds to serotonin receptors, which regulate mood and anxiety, and it impacts dopamine release. These systems can also help reduce pain, McCurdy says—making it difficult to parse out which compounds are really at work. “We just don’t understand exactly how they are playing together,” he says.  Kratom is a stimulant at lower doses but, paradoxically, at higher doses it induces drowsiness or sedative reactions more akin to those produced by opiates.   McCurdy and colleagues’ surveys show the majority of kratom users believe it relieves their anxiety or chronic pain, and that they aren’t using kratom in an abusive way. “They say I take my two or three grams of powder, morning and evening, and it helps me function or gives me energy,” McCurdy says. “Of course we can’t say if it actually works because we don’t have the scientific studies to prove that.”   C. Michael White, a distinguished professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Connecticut, agrees. “Data on kratom use for anxiety, for alertness, to reduce fatigue, or any other purpose is very scant,” he says. Though no randomized, controlled clinical trials have rigorously assessed pain relief in patients, some kratom research shows promise for short-term pain relief. However, some chronic kratom users do experience increased pain and sensitivity when they stop taking it.  (Could this be the solution to chronic pain?) “I would never suggest someone use kratom as a pain reliever because the benefits are not established, there are many other options, and there are real risks,” White says. Kratom use is common among those with opioid use disorder. Although no randomized, controlled trials prove its merit for addiction treatment, White says many people argue that using kratom helps keep them from more dangerous illicit opioids. “This is where kratom may actually have a role in our healthcare system,” White says. “If you have access to addiction treatment, definitely try the proven options first. However, if you are unable to afford treatment, you are unwilling to out yourself and admit you have addiction, or you are not being provided sufficient treatment and will relapse to illicit opioid use, kratom is likely a much better option.” “Kratom seems much less likely to stop someone from breathing than other opioids,” he adds, “because it is a central nervous system stimulant not a depressant.” While kratom teas and other fresh leaf products have long been used safely in Southeast Asia, studies have shown Western users often consume very different stuff—with huge, unknown variations in the amount of active chemical ingredients. “There’s a variety of products that are called kratom, but I compare it to the range from a Miller Light to Everclear,” McCurdy says. “We know there is a spectrum from safe to toxic, but we don’t know where the break point is.” Dried leaf material sold in capsules or bulk powder, used to make teas or just consumed whole, tends to be less potent, McCurdy notes. Other kratom supplements are made from leaves that have been processed, refined, or manipulated to produce extract products that deliver a higher chemical dose with a higher risk of negative effects. Then, at the extreme end, there are kratom supplements that McCurdy says are essentially synthetic 7-hydroxymitragynine products. “Some things being marketed as kratom are so far removed from the plant that they are basically pharmaceuticals,” McCurdy cautions. These can more easily be over-consumed, sometimes with serious consequences, sometimes by people who hope it will give them a euphoric high. “Unfortunately it doesn’t work like that,” he says. “All of a sudden you have a huge amount of exposure into your system and could be suddenly in the ER experiencing very negative side effects.”  Some kratom products aren’t labeled either, so buyers may not be able to tell how potent they are—and since kratom isn’t regulated or tested it can be adulterated with lead and other heavy metals, or even other chemicals, the FDA warns. “It’s the Wild West, in my opinion, and it’s buyer beware,” McCurdy says. Compared to strong opioids like morphine, heroin, and oxycodone, the risk of becoming addicted to kratom is relatively low; however the FDA warns that people can become addicted after taking it for long periods of time for pain, anxiety, or to boost mood or energy. “You start out voluntarily taking it, but at a certain point you need to take it just to feel regular,” White says. “Then if you don’t take it instead of going back to your normal state you feel worse.” (What can your DNA say about your risk of opioid addiction?) Some research, including a recently completed FDA Single Ascending Dose trial, suggests that taking kratom in reasonable doses may do little harm in the short term, says McCurdy, whose team partnered on the research. But the research included only a single dose, and the possible consequences of long-term use aren’t well known. Numerous states have pending legislation to limit concentrations of mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine in kratom products, impose age restrictions on who can buy them, and require products to be labeled and tested. That seems like a sensible step to Grinspoon. “In a perfect world there would be a safe, regulated supply, because I actually think it can be helpful to people,” he says. “But I also think that kratom shows some of the big gaps in a regulatory landscape that put a lot of people at risk,” he adds. “A lot of people that take this are young people—and right now it's sort of like an uncontrolled experiment.”  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

Giant freshwater fish are among the most endangered animals on Earth. But in the lush waterways of the Amazon, one leviathan is swimming against the current. Meet the arapaima, a fish capable of growing up to 10 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds. Just over a decade ago, this popular seafood species faced extinction, its numbers ravaged by overfishing. But conservation efforts spearheaded by local communities have turned things around for the arapaima, with populations increasing dramatically across the Amazon. (Read about efforts to save the world’s biggest freshwater fish.) In areas where communities have adopted sustainable fishing practices, arapaima numbers increased 425 percent in 11 years, according to research by João Campos-Silva, a Brazilian ecologist and National Geographic Explorer. He is part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Amazon Expedition—a two-year scientific exploration of the river basin. The number has since grown to 600 percent, though those results have not yet been published, he says. To date, Campos-Silva has worked with around 40 communities along the Juruá River, a major Amazon tributary that traverses mostly pristine rainforest in western Brazil. Overall in the Amazon, around 1,100 communities have adopted conservation initiatives for the fish, which are listed as data deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The arapaima’s resurgence is a conservation triumph that can serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other large aquatic species in the Amazon and globally, he says. And it highlights the crucial role of local communities in leading successful conservation endeavors. “For many, many decades, people have been looking to the outside for solutions to the problems in the Amazon, but the arapaima story shows that the answers are often in the hands of the local people and communities living in the forest,” says Campos-Silva. “They are the knowledge keepers.” Roughly the size of the contiguous United States, South America’s Amazon Basin, 60 percent of which lies within Brazil’s borders, is home to tens of millions of people, including around 400 Indigenous groups. The basin is crisscrossed by thousands of rivers with more fish species than in any other river system on Earth. The largest scaled freshwater fish in the world, the arapaima in Brazil is known as the “pirarucu,” a word in the aboriginal Tupí language that translates to “red fish,” after its reddish tail. Prowling the region’s lakes and swamps, the predatory arapaima is an air breather that can only stay submerged for 10 to 20 minutes before resurfacing to breathe using a specialized, lung-like swim bladder. This surfacing behavior makes arapaimas easy to catch. A 2014 study found their demand as seafood led to severe overfishing that depleted populations in three out of four of the fishing communities surveyed; the fish completely disappeared from a fifth. By then, Brazil’s government had set up an extensive network of protected areas throughout the Amazon, with several states banning arapaima fishing. To better manage the species, scientists also developed a method to count arapaimas in their lake habitats, drawing inspiration from techniques used to survey breaching whales in the ocean. The individuals most skilled at counting the fish were those who know them best: fishermen. “In the split second that an arapaima comes to the surface, an experienced fisherman can tell you the size, weight, and direction of its movement,” says Leandro Castello, a tropical ecologist at Virginia Tech’s Global Change Center who developed the arapaima-counting model. About 15 years ago, Campos-Silva, who initially worked on birds before turning his attention to Amazonian biodiversity, began working along the Juruá River, collaborating closely with the residents of the tight-knit São Raimundo community. He also supported the efforts of a local group called the Association of Rural Producers of Carauari to manage arapaima protected areas. The São Raimundo community integrated their traditional knowledge with scientific methodologies, effectively making the conservation efforts their own, he says. “They had seen the decline in their fisheries and were eager to find solutions to improve the situation,” he says. (Read more about how scientists are saving megafishes.) Based on fish counts, the community established a sustainable catch quota, with the federal government permitting an arapaima harvest of up to 30 percent of adults in protected areas. Fish under five feet long could not be harvested.  Most arapaimas spawn just after seasonal floodwaters rise and spread into the forest. When waters recede during the dry season, the fish are confined to isolated lakes and river channels. It's during this time that fishing operations are allowed. The actions produced almost immediate results: Arapaima numbers, boosted by the species' exceptionally rapid growth rate, swiftly recovered. As other Juruá River communities adopted the strategy, Campos-Silva was stunned by the economic and social benefits it yielded for local people. In addition to households making more money, improved fishing earnings were reinvested in local schools, health centers, and basic infrastructure. “People realized that through conservation, they can have a better life,” he says. The community-driven initiatives have also enhanced the status of women, who, despite constituting nearly half of the global fisheries workforce, frequently go unacknowledged and unpaid. Women in the Brazilian Amazon are increasingly taking on roles aboard boats and participating more actively in decision-making processes, research shows. “Our research shows that women are now for the first time earning their own money from Amazonian fishing, which is helping to eradicate general poverty,” says Campos-Silva. In 2018, Campos-Silva founded Instituto Juruá, a Manaus-based nonprofit promoting biodiversity conservation and improved quality of life for local communities. He has since expanded his work to other parts of the Brazilian Amazon as well as the Ucayali River in Peru, another major tributary of the Amazon River with a large Indigenous population. He and other scientists continue to gain deeper insights into the movement, ecology, and population dynamics of the arapaima, including through tagging and radio-tracking fish. For instance, they’ve found that for a population of arapaima to be deemed healthy, there should be a minimum of 30 individual fish per square kilometer of floodplain. The community-based conservation approach has yielded even more spectacular results in Guyana, with arapaima populations there increasing tenfold since the turn of the millennium, says Donald Stewart, a fisheries professor at State University of New York. Yet there are still many unmanaged areas of the Amazon where arapaimas may be going locally extinct. “Vast areas still don’t have rigorous population counts or local engagement to protect the fishes from outsiders,” he says. Stewart believes the arapaima could be the largest freshwater fish on Earth. Studying growth ring deposition on the scales of arapaimas living in Guyana’s Essequibo River have shown those animals may grow much heavier than those from central Brazil, Stewart says. His research has shown there are several more distinct species of arapaimas, and some could still be considered critically endangered. (Read about a new arapaima species announced in 2016.) Unmanaged movements of arapaima around Brazil could lead to disease transfer and genetic mixing among these potentially distinct populations, issues that remain largely unstudied. For Zeb Hogan, a biology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a National Geographic Explorer, the arapaima conservation success can be a model for protecting and managing populations of other endangered giant fish around the world. “These results buck an otherwise gloomy trend of severe decline of most species of aquatic megafauna,” he says. “It’s a rare example of a win-win solution that can be replicated in many areas worldwide.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

51,Julia Sklar,How chronic stress and racial trauma are related,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/racial-trauma-chronic-stress-mental-health,The exclusion of racial trauma from the main mental health diagnostic manual can make it hard to get help. This is how people can find support.,2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"The exclusion of racial trauma from the main mental health diagnostic manual can make it hard to get help. This is how people can find support. While PTSD is a form of chronic stress where the initial stressful event has passed, other forms of chronic stress arise when the event is ongoing, such as racial trauma. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) overlooks this experience, despite plenty of people trying to figure out how to live with the effects of racial trauma in a resilient way—choosing a response to chronic societal stress that leads to growth rather than harm. While the exclusion of racial trauma from that official diagnostic handbook can make it difficult to receive validating, effective mental health support for it, adding it in may not be the answer either. Some experts worry that putting racial trauma in the DSM would dismiss people’s experiences in other ways—namely by pathologizing an adaptive response to an unjust world. Juliette McClendon is a clinical and research psychologist who formerly studied post-traumatic stress disorder at the VA Boston Healthcare System and co-founded a private practice. She offers a few examples of such responses: a Black person, especially in the United States, feeling on guard at the sound of police sirens; code-switching (changing speech in different environments); or staying hypervigilant in a workplace where they’re the only person of color by documenting all their professional interactions. These are basic ways of staying safe. “There are a lot of healthy adaptations to racism, but what we can see sometimes, when somebody is experiencing racial trauma, is that the adaptation has started to interfere in other parts of their life,” McClendon says. “It’s one thing to be on guard when you hear a police siren, it’s another thing to constantly be on guard every time you leave your house, but it’s understandable.” Despite the open debate about formalizing psychiatric treatment for racial trauma, cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy are among the current mental health care options best suited to helping people live their healthiest lives within the realities of systemic racism. The hallmarks of these mental health interventions are to build healthy mindsets and coping strategies to help a person thrive amid challenges. This approach differs from psychoanalysis, for example, which tends to concern itself with delving into how past experiences have shaped us. In McClendon’s practice, they approach racial trauma by going beyond someone’s internal experience. “We have to take into account not only the individual and what they’re doing but also their community—their broader environment—and how they can find tools, skills, resources, [and] outlets to reduce the impact of discrimination on their life.” Partnering with a therapist who fully engages with a client’s background can add an extra layer of effectiveness to cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapies—whether it’s because therapist and client share an identity, or because the therapist has training in cultural responsiveness. McClendon hopes to see the latter as an increasing norm in the field. However, the realities of accessing this type of mental health care can present their own set of stressors. In the U.S., people across different races and ethnicities have similar rates of mental health disorders, yet such disorders are more likely to go untreated in communities of color. Also consistent across race and ethnicity populations in the U.S. is that the most cited barriers to mental health care are cost and lack of insurance. Additionally, there is a shortage of mental health professionals, in particular a shortage of mental health professionals of color. “A lot of times people want to work with somebody who shares their cultural background, and they don’t have that option, so it can push people out of the mental health system,” laments McClendon. Once someone feels alienated from this care system, it’s difficult to get them back. Virtual therapy, also known as telepsychiatry, can lower some of these barriers. Research shows that it is nearly as effective as in-person therapy, and it is the best option in cases where severe anxiety or mobility may limit someone from accessing mental health care in person. These resources can transcend a geographical area, giving users a wider range of therapists from which to choose. However, insurance coverage for telehealth is a moving target. The pandemic temporarily heralded unprecedented insurance model changes in the U.S., with Medicare and Medicaid covering virtual services and the loosening of some rules that formerly restricted practices from crossing state lines; however, with the waning of COVID-19-era rules, insurance companies are rolling back many of these dispensations. Access problems can also be social, not just logistical: Stigma remains a block to seeking out care. If therapy remains out of reach, stress relief from racial trauma can also come from outside a clinical setting. McClendon offers a three-pronged approach: First and foremost, turn to inward-facing activities to dial down a fight-or-flight stress response that may be activated beyond a healthful level. Those activities will look different for everyone but might include calm, neutral experiences like meditation, creative practices, or reading. Once a person has gotten their body back to homeostasis, McClendon encourages people to assess their community. Partly that looks like finding supportive social connections, but it also includes identifying parts of a community that may be actively harming a person and figuring out how to better cope in the present circumstances. The last stage is growing into empowerment through enacting community change. “A lot of times people who are experiencing racial trauma feel powerless because they feel like there’s nothing that they can do to change the world and change the fact that racism exists,” McClendon says. “I work with people to try and find for themselves: How can you be an activist?” Beyond individual activism, it remains for the broader community to create and support environments that are healthy and safe for everyone. This is an ongoing effort that requires participation from people of all demographics.  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

52,David Shortell,Mexico City is running out of water—are these cities next?,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/major-cities-mexico-water-day-zero,"Drought, urban development, and poor management are causing an unprecedented strain on urban water supplies across the world.",2024-06-14T00:00:00Z,"Drought, urban development, and poor management are causing an unprecedented strain on urban water supplies across the world. Record-breaking heat and years of mounting drought, capped last June by El Niño winds that cut the rainy season short, have pushed Mexico City’s water reservoirs into a historic deficit. As of this month, reservoirs sit at less than 27 percent capacity.  The consequences in Mexico City have so far been devastating: more than 550 neighborhoods have had their tap water turned off or their water pressure reduced, according to one analysis of data from a local water authority. These water saving measures are forcing residents to fill whatever jugs they can gather at irregular and costly tanker deliveries. As summer begins, the megacity of 23 million is on the brink of disaster. If heavy rains don’t arrive soon, in late June the city’s Cutzamala water system could reach “Day Zero,” a doomsday estimation that marks the moment the reservoirs will stop pumping. That means that in as much as a quarter of the city—even zones that have typically escaped water shortages—the taps would go bone dry. The aquifers where about 70 percent of the city’s water comes from will keep flowing, but they too are in danger. “We’re in a truly awful situation,” said José Luis Luege, a former head of the national water commission and adviser to the country’s political opposition who helped popularize Mexico City’s Day Zero deadline. “At this point, I’m really betting on a miracle.” Across the world, climate change is exacerbating droughts, sending urban areas already set back by unchecked development and aging water infrastructure into unprecedented territory. The idea of Day Zero, used globally to help turbo-drive water-saving campaigns, has proved a helpful threat. Here’s how some of the most water-starved cities are grappling with their own Day Zero fears.  Rolling water cuts have roiled the Colombian capital of Bogotá since April, after the Chingaza reservoir system that provides more than two-thirds of the city’s drinking water dropped to a staggering 17 percent capacity. Running water in neighborhoods across the city of eight million is shut off three times a month and households are subject to hundreds of dollars in fines if they go over monthly allotments.  “The entire city must be in water saving mode,” Mayor Carlos Fernando Galán warned as he announced the restrictions, along with PSAs that reflected the desperation: shower with your partner—or not at all, if you don’t plan to leave your home. While experts have criticized the city for waiting too long to implement rationing, under the policy, the water level in the Chingaza system ticked back up, topping 36 percent capacity earlier this month. Still, the measures could remain in place through October as the reservoirs fill to a target amount. In 2019, the coastal city of Chennai, India, struck a form of Day Zero when its four main reservoirs completely dried out, leaving its 10 million residents dependent on a shrinking groundwater supply and trucked-in water.  “You had to spend a lot of time to get [water], you had to spend a lot of resources to get it,” said Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, a senior program manager in the sustainable cities and transport program of World Resources Institute, India. Today, water scarcity in India is being felt most sharply in Delhi, where a recent video of residents swarming a water tanker was filmed and shared widely online. With several days of summer still left before the monsoon season brings rain, levels of the river they draw water from are unusually low. A water sharing agreement between the states that border the river that experts call insufficient has led to disputes.   The tourist-mecca of Barcelona devolved into backbiting this year as dwindling water supplies pitted visitors against locals. In March, following three years of drought, levels in the Ter-Llobregat water system hit an all-time low, below 15 percent, triggering emergency water restrictions.  While the city’s nearly two million residents were limited to 53 gallons of water per day, the tourism industry did not face the same restrictions. The disparity spilled into public debate, with activists cutting off the water to the offices of a city tourism board and candidates in a regional election vowing reform.  Along with the restrictions, the city implemented a number of expensive technological solutions to augment drinking water supplies. Desalination, the process of turning saltwater into potable fresh water, was operating at max capacity. Treated wastewater was also introduced. These efforts helped avert a Day Zero type event until generous May and June rains helped replenish the system, although the drought persists, said Hug March Corbella, a professor of political ecology at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.  Last-ditch contingency plans to ship in clean water from other parts of Spain and install a new desalination plant at the Port of Barcelona have proved so far unnecessary. The first widely recognized Day Zero scenario to dominate international headlines came in 2018 in Cape Town, South Africa. After three years of drought, officials raised the alarm: the city of nearly five million had just months to go before its feeder reservoirs would fall to a critical threshold. The local government imposed severe water restrictions that limited residents to 13 gallons a day and urged austerity at home, which successfully maintained reservoir levels until the arrival of heavy rain. But head inland, into the country’s economic hub of six million people, and another water crisis looms. Residents across Johannesburg periodically face days and weeks of water cut-offs, which they’ve begun to call “water shedding”—a nod to the country’s notorious blackouts that power providers term “load shedding.”  The problem, however, is not low levels at the river system that provides drinking water to the province. Rather, “dilapidated water infrastructure and poor water management” by “dysfunctional municipalities” are to blame for the shortages, said Anja du Plessis, an associate professor in the department of geography at the University of South Africa.  Facing its sixth year of drought in early 2024, Moroccan officials restricted the use of traditional public baths and popular car wash street businesses across the country, as supplies diminished in important dams like the Al Massira.  Seen from above in NASA satellite imagery, the area around the dam, which has historically provided water to parts of Casablanca and been used to irrigate crops in the region, was sapped of greenery for miles, leaving only a parched surface visible from space.  Water piped in from another dam in the north and the arrival of rain ensured the safety of household water access for Casablanca’s nearly four million residents.  A new desalination plant that broke ground this month—set to be the largest in Africa—also promises to bolster supply. But the impact of drought on the agricultural industry, which accounts for more than 30 percent of the country’s employment, may pose a greater disruption. Poorer harvests are fueling internal migration from rural communities to urban areas, placing even greater strain on city water resources, said Meryem Tanarhte, who researches climate change and its effect on water resources at University Hassan II in Casablanca. As the planet has warmed, scientists have shown that rainfall around the globe has become more variable and extreme, meaning periods of drought are happening more frequently and with greater intensity and length.  In Mexico City, scientists like Fabiola Sosa Rodríguez, the head of economic growth and environment studies at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Azcapotzalco, are using the crisis to advocate for long-term water solutions. She points to a need for more wastewater treatment for industrial and agricultural purposes and the expansion of rainwater harvesting programs that can double household capacity.  “Many people don’t like to talk about Day Zero because it makes them afraid, it makes them feel a sense of emergency,” she said. “But these are precisely the levels of consciousness that we have to generate.”  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

53,SJ Armstrong,Why 2024 is the prime time to discover Kazakhstan,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-discover-kazakhstan,"Direct flight routes, festivals with nomadic flair and millennia-old natural beauty are drawing travellers to the Kazakh Steppe this year. Here's how to explore the best of the country's landscapes, culture and events in 2024.",2024-06-15T00:00:00Z,"Direct flight routes, festivals with nomadic flair and millennia-old natural beauty are drawing travellers to the Kazakh Steppe this year. Here's how to explore the best of the country's landscapes, culture and events in 2024. Stretching far out into the horizon, the vast grass seas of the Great Steppe roll across Central Asia in a rugged and dramatic fashion. Though occasionally roamed by the rare horse rider or lone nomad, the plains of Kazakhstan are largely unexplored by the majority of travellers. But this beautiful, remote region is increasingly showing its modern identity to the world through its cities, events and transport hubs. Thanks to a number of direct flight routes from London and 30-day visa-free access for UK visitors, it's now easier than ever to experience Kazakhstan’s distinctive culture and landscapes. Here’s how to do it. Most visitors will enter Kazakhstan from the forest-swathed southeast, landing in Almaty. Divided by dense thickets of pine and birch, the city’s surrounding green mountain peaks conceal vast lakes and twisting horse-back trails. In Kolsai Lakes National Park, Lake Kaindy’s cerulean waters draw the most attention. Here, a landslide triggered by an earthquake formed a natural dam and submerged a spruce forest beneath the surface of the lake. It’s now surrounded by picturesque hiking trails and secluded accommodation options. For equally dramatic yet drastically different scenery, travel from Almaty to Charyn Canyon. Easily traversable, this vast red and golden gorge is cut through by a walkable or driveable (in a 4x4) trail guiding visitors to dizzying desert viewpoints. Those keen to venture deeper into central Kazakhstan can take the train into the region of Turkistan and the historic Silk Road city of Shymkent. Life has persevered here since the fourth century, with the city playing host to Sufi sheikhs and Mongol leaders, and becoming a centre of Islamic learning under the Timurids. Hop over low-lying mud-brick walls and stroll between the turquoise-tiled domes that cap mausoleums around the city, or roam the battlement ridges of the protective outer wall. The city’s Uzbek architecture and Persian designs were conserved under Soviet rule, making it an ideal stop for those curious about the history of the Turkic Steppe and a great base for further exploration of the Turkistan Region. When in the west, the port city of Aktau and its Caspian shores offer easy access to the otherworldly plateaus that characterise the Mangystau Region. Laced with lines of ochre rock and amber streaks, here colourful geology enshrouds labyrinthine desert trails and dramatic gorges. Sharp jutting ridges and undulating rock formations shadow clear traces of 50 million years of life existing in its canyons — palaeontologists regularly unearth new evidence of animal life in the Ustyurt Nature Reserve. From large Tyrannosaurus rex and mammoths to giant fish fossilised within the Paleozoic seas, the fauna of the region has been millennia in the making.  All these landscapes have been navigated for centuries by the nomadic people of the steppe, whose ancient traditions you can witness today. Observe displays of horse riding or falconers flying their hunting eagles before settling down to try beshbarmak, a platter of boiled meat and innards served with a glass of fermented milk to settle the stomach. Alternatively, order qurt, a cheese made from goat’s or camel’s milk that’s stored in saddlebags and churned by the galloping motion of the nomads’ horses. Why now?In September 2024, competitors from all over the Eurasian Steppe will converge in Astana for the fifth World Nomad Games. Athletes participate in events like mounted archery, falconry, goat pulling and horseback wrestling. Where to stay?Visitors from the UK should base themselves in either Aktau or Almaty, both of which are accessible via direct flights from London Heathrow with Air Astana up to four times a week. These cosmopolitan hubs serve as gateways to the country’s best natural and cultural experiences. To catch the World Nomad Games, take a domestic flight to the country’s capital, Astana. When to travel?Seasons are an intense affair in Kazakhstan as temperatures can range from 40C to -20C. The best time to visit is during the spring or autumn, when the climate is more moderate. In winter, head to Almaty, where ski areas are accessed via cable-car.  Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC. All rights reserved"
