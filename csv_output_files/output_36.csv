Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. You can just say, TikTok made me buy it. BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review: ""My hair has never been better! I got this because of TikTok and it has done wonders for my hair. My hair isn’t frizzy or dull looking when I get up in the morning."" —Aaron Key Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 36 colors and four sizes). Promising review: ""When it got here I cleaned it and put it in the freezer. I took it out a day later and filled it with Diet Coke just to see what it does. Squeeze it a few times and it's 100% a slushy. I am shocked and thrilled. Worth the money. It has some type of ribbing inside that freezes. If you enjoy a cold beverage, get it quick."" —GEORGE Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in two colors and two-packs). Promising review: ""I saw one of these in action at a friend's house like five years ago and thought it was just a made up memory, because making ice cream out of solely frozen fruit seems wild. But when I saw a TikTok about it I immediately went to Amazon and bought it. Literally this was the BEST decision of my life. I cannot believe still how amazing this thing is! It makes the creamiest, best-tasting fruit ice cream ever. It’s easy to take apart and clean, and super easy to use."" —DMCKAY Get it from Amazon for $36.22. Fullstar is a small business established in 2017 that specializes in kitchen gadgets.  Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action.  Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.87 (available in four colors). Reviewers note that these work best if you put them somewhere the flies are already attracted to — these will trap them, but they won't attract them on their own.  Promising review: ""A must for your plants. Great for all those fungus gnats near my plants! I saw this shown on a TikTok used in a vivarium enclosure and had to try it. Works great and is very attractive-looking."" —Mac Get a pack of 18 from Amazon for $8.99 (available in 12 styles and multi-packs).  Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action.  Puracy is a Texas-based, family-owned small business specializing in plant-based, chemical-free, hypoallergenic home products, with a donation made to local families in need with a portion of every purchase.  Promising review: ""For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS spilling things on my shirts and I cook every night (sometimes I remember the apron, sometimes I don't). My clothes are a mess by the end of the day. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. I have tried EVERYTHING there is to remove stains and this is the absolute BEST thing out there. (There is simply not a major stain remover that I have not tried.) The only thing close is a long pre-soak (I mean like six hours) in Oxyclean. With Puracy, you get the best result by doing it well in advance, but for me that is another plus because I would far rather spray them when I put them in the hamper than do it all at once just before I do the laundry. It seems to get everything out and I've never had any trouble with damaged fabric. I don't really review very much, but this is seriously outstanding."" —NYC Buyer Get it from Amazon for $12.99. A lot of people compare it to the Magic Eraser in paste form, so even your weirdest, most stubborn stains will meet their match. Promising review: ""Found this product on TikTok. I don’t think I’ve ever seen value like I do this product! Literally use it on EVERYTHING!! Kids and teens have dirt, grime, and grease on their walls? ...This will make it look like a new paint job. Baseboards need some love? A pea-size amount of this makes them look brand-new. Need a shoe cleaner? PERFECT for sneakers. I could name a million more uses, but I can ASSURE you this is worth every penny. What’s more? You need such LITTLE of this product, it will last a VERY long time. Thank you, TikTok!!!"" —Rachel in CLT Get it from Amazon for $5.29. Promising review: ""Love these liners I saw on TikTok! What a time saver!"" —Angie ""I was skeptical but I was also tired of cleaning my air fryer of crumbs all the time. I have a PowerXl air fryer and one of these fits perfectly in there. I can do French fries or any other fried food and discard the liner and the fryer is still nice and clean. I use two when I do juicy items, hot dogs, chicken breast, sausage and when I'm done I take out the meat and lift out the liners and all the gross juice comes out with it leaving the fryer ready to clean in the sink with hot water, no gross juice to pour out or get in the sink. I highly recommend."" —Kevin M. Harer Get a set of 125 for $11.69+ (available in multiple sizes and shapes for square and round air fryers).  It also includes four dry-erase markers!  Promising review: ""Saw it on TikTok being used as a dinner menu for the week! It will help me be more organized and add little chores that needs to completed or important reminders. Love it, no complaints."" —Clarince Thomas Get it from Amazon for $16.99.  Promising review: ""I LOVE this product so much! I drink iced coffee on the daily but the system I had just wasn't cutting it for me. I didn't know how to brew cold coffee at home (all we have is a Keurig, and there's no cold brew option) so I would go buy iced coffee from Dunkin' every morning. Now don't get me wrong, i love my Dunkin', but I wanted to find a way to be able to make that same iced coffee at HOME, and I think my wallet and gas tank wanted me to figure that out too. I found out about this product through TikTok and it is a GAME CHANGER. All you have to do is put coffee grounds in the filter, fill up the main compartment 3/4 full with water (I use water from my fridge), screw the filter into the lid and screw the lid shut, shake it a little to put the coffee grounds to work, and let it do its magic for 12–24 hours! This is probably the best investment I've ever made. You need this!!"" —Carmen E.  Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in two sizes and three colors). Check out a TikTok of the rapid cold brew maker in action.  Promising review: ""I like cold brew year-round, which may be my favorite method/machine yet! It’s so easy to assemble, use, and clean. In about 15 minutes, I was impressed with how rich and bold the brew was, with no grounds like others I’ve tried. It looks great on my kitchen counter. It’s lightweight and stable with the base suction cups. It makes a little noise but much less than I expected (and less than my Nespresso machine)."" —Liz Get it from Amazon for $105.77.  ""Our family unearthed this because beloved To All The Boys I've Loved Before author Jenny Han mentioned that it was her secret to delicious popcorn, and it may have just wrecked me for other at-home popcorn for the rest of my life. It genuinely tastes just as salty and buttery and savory as fresh movie theater popcorn. I inhaled it so fast that every single one of my organs lit up in mild alarm."" —Emma Lord Promising review: ""I am a person who will make myself sick eating buckets of popcorn (I have no self-control). This has by far been my favorite 'TikTok made me buy' item. My at-home popcorn is now my favorite thing to make and I don't need to go the theater for popcorn. Very much worth the purchase and this will last me such a long time."" —S Martinez Get it from Amazon for $9.40 (available in two other flavors). Promising review: ""Fancy! I’m a sucker for gadgets, and well, you know TikTok…the grands request the 'fancy' hotdogs now when hotdogs are on the menu. I didn’t expect them to taste any different, but it upped that game too."" —Ret  Get it from Amazon for $21.99.  Check out a TikTok of the solar lights in action.  Promising review: ""To say I love these lights would be a understatement. They’re easy to hang, great looking, bright, and they work amazingly!!! On a sunny day, these lights charge enough to stay on from sunset to sunrise. Yep! That’s right! They’re still on until sunrise. These are the only brand of solar lights that I’ve ever purchased that last that long (and I’ve gone through more than my share of solar light.). These are DEFINITELY worth the price. You won’t be disappointed!! Btw — this is the fourth set I purchased; I love them that much. The first set I purchased is over a year old and they’re still working as well as they did on day one."" —Josie Elliot-Goforth Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two lengths and two brightness levels).  Check out a TikTok of the condiment fork in action.  Promising review: ""Great kitchen item. Forks are great to get pickles out of the jar, but if you have kids/lazy people (lol) you know that dirty hands are going into that jar. 😉 This has really prevented that from happening. It comes with two different rings to fit whatever size jar, a stabber holder, and a stabbing stick."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $8.99.  Promising review: ""Yes, I did it. I bought the TikTok blender and don't regret it one bit. I can create any smoothie I want, from healthy to dessert shakes for the kids. So easy to use, charge and clean. It's a must-buy!!!"" —Debby from Warren Get it from Amazon for $31.78+ (available in five colors).  Check out a TikTok of the Beast Blender in action.  Promising review: ""I have tried so many blenders, and they all break, or the blending power won’t be as strong within a few months. This blender has been so great the last few months! It’s super easy to use and super easy to clean. Before I purchased the blender, I was worried the blender cup would be too small for my husband's smoothie, but it was a perfect size for us. The blending power is amazing, and the blender isn’t loud either!"" —Vanessa Mendez Get it from Amazon for $164.95 (available in two colors). Psst — you can use these to freeze iced coffee or juice to add to your morning iced coffee or cocktails to cool them without watering them down!  Promising review: ""I was at a restaurant and they put one of these roses in my cocktail. I knew right then I had to make these at home and ordered these while at the restaurant. These are easy to fill and have rubber snaps that lock them tight. They come right out and you can even take just one out and leave the others for the next time. These are a hit at all of my dinner parties too! I have already ordered more as my friends all want these in their drinks!"" —Siri US Get it from Amazon for $7.99.  Dan O's seasoning is a small business established in 2017 that gained popularity after taking to TikTok during the pandemic, where the company now has 3.8 million followers with plenty of droolworthy food content.  Promising review: ""I became interested in this product while watching TikToks. I have been adding it to so many things. I use it in spaghetti, on fish, and one of my favorites is to add it to popcorn. My husband had to ask why my popcorn smelled like steak. I love the fact that it is low sodium as well. I am not a fan of extra salt and most foods already have plenty of salt but need some seasoning. This should be your go to seasoning."" —Heartcri Get a pack of two (one original, one spicy) from Amazon for $13.99. Check out a TikTok of the Kooler Kube in action.  Promising review: ""I purchased my Kooler Kube to use when I go to weekend horse shows. I love this product! It kept my cooler cold all weekend long. The Kube was still frozen after four days of hot summer sun. I am so impressed that I plan to purchase more Kooler Kubes to give as gifts to my horse show friends. Thanks, Kooler Kube, for a product that performs!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $16.99.  It's also a lot more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than wine wands or other competitors — a single bottle of this can be used to treat up to 55 glasses of wine, as opposed to wands that can only do a few glasses each before they get tossed. Drop It recommends 1–2 drops for each glass of white wine, 2–3 for a glass of red, and 7–9 if you're treating the whole bottle at once. Once it's in the glass, swirl lightly for 20 seconds, and you should be raring to go!  Promising review: ""I ordered this product after seeing it on TikTok with further investigation. And I must say it does work. I love sweet wine but will always get a headache the next morning (one glass). After using it, I did not have one the next morning. 😊"" —Theresa B.  Get it from Amazon for $14.99. Chill-O-Matic is a small business that specializes in beverage accessories.  Check out a TikTok of the Chill-O-Matic in action.  Promising review: ""I was so afraid of wasting money. But I didn’t. I love my sodas cold. But sometimes there’s not a cold one available, and waiting 30-40 min for one to get cold in the freezer is not always ideal. This will get your room temp can to fridge cold in 90 seconds. I let it run double that to get almost freezer cold. I wish it had a power cord. But I do appreciate the portability that the batteries provide. I can’t wait to try it out on vacationing, as access to cold sodas isn’t always available. All you need is a literally a little bit of ice."" —G. Massey Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in two colors).  Beach State is a small business specializing in premium, high quality beach umbrellas.  Check out a TikTok of the umbrella in action.  Promising review: ""This umbrella is exactly what my family was looking for as our everyday beach umbrella — large diameter, high quality, and cute retro design. It is a higher end umbrella but still slightly less expensive than the other big name designer beach gear company that we were considering. It is easy to pop up and stays standing, and we’ve had many compliments from other people at the beach asking where we got it. The customer service from the company was excellent. Would definitely recommend these umbrellas!"" —Taryn Get it from Amazon for $170 (available in seven colors).  Check out a TikTok of the tabletop fire pit in action.  Promising review: ""This mini campfire is perfect for front porch or rainy day s'mores! We used this inside and out, a great option for a makeshift fire. The quality is fantastic, and this is easily portable. It would make a great gift!"" —Alyssa H Get it from Amazon for $29.99.  Check out a TikTok of the water dispenser in action.  Promising review: ""I love the convenience of having water in my room at all times during the day and night. The unit is quiet, and I love that you can specify the desired water level in your cup. Honestly, this is by far my best Amazon order. I absolutely love it!!!"" —Ricki Get it from Amazon for $21.99 (available in six colors).  Promising review: ""This little utensil is adorable, and quite practical. When I saw it on TikTok I knew I had to have one. You simply put a slice of lemon in and pour out the juice. It looks so pretty sitting on the table and comes in very handy."" —Dian Marchese Get it from Amazon for $7.99.  Each bottle comes with 20 mini CO2 cartridges (with more refills available separately).  Check out a TikTok of the Ote sparkling water maker in action.  Promising review: ""Love this bottle/soda maker. I am obsessed with fizzy drinks and cannot take my bulkier at-home maker with me to work or when I travel. This maker allowed me the compact convenience of taking my fizzy drinks everywhere I go. I can control what I put in my body and always get my flavors I love. 10 out of 10 do recommend! —Zeusboomer911 Get it from Amazon for $49.99. Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."
1,Aaron Ant,"Benedict Cumberbatch Thrills In Netflix's ""Eric"": Here's What People Are Saying",https://www.buzzfeed.com/aronawriting/eric-netflix-benedict-cumberbatch-fan-tweets,And the verdict is in.View Entire Post ›,2024-06-10T21:44:25Z,"And the verdict is in. BuzzFeed Contributor Vincent, a jaded puppeteer, delves deeper into a dark hole in an attempt to find his son. He's aided by a 7-foot puppet named Eric (voiced by Cumberbatch), a figment of Vincent's imagination. The series is a gripping exploration of the protagonist's decaying mental state with hints of psychedelia and dark humor scattered across the six-episode series.  However, the impeccable cast executes these ideas to a T and adds palpable tension throughout the series. Gaby Hoffmann and McKinley Belcher III were cast in supporting roles as Vincent’s wife Cassie Anderson and NYPD officer Michael Ledroit, respectively, whose perspectives of trying to locate Edgar prove to be critical components in Vincent’s journey to redemption.  #Eric on @netflix is dark, emotional, and captivating. Definitely recommend. Limited series includes themes of alcoholism, drug use, sexuality, family issues, and delusion. Phenomenal performances by entire cast. pic.twitter.com/1SPR9smo7Z Watching Eric on Netflix in which Benedict Cumberbatch does blow and then dances to Gloria with human-sized imaginary puppet.

Great narrative, and social /historical references, yet no specific year or city. It alludes to NYC and the mid to late 80s HIV and Aids crisis is so smart. It addresses homelessness, homophobia, mental health, and addiction issues. I recommend it Genius in every way. The writing by Abi Morgan, the impeccable acting, the recreation of 80s New York, the way the storylines weave reality & fantasy. It’s got the innocence of a Jim Henson production, an underworld like Dante and tragic heroes like Shakespeare. #Eric on Netflix pic.twitter.com/D76YQIhF3x “TRUTH IS EVERYONE THINKS OF CHANGING THE WORLD NO ONE THINKS OF CHANGING THEMSELVES” ERIC.

Points for ambition, since it tries to tackle a *ton* of themes (racism, police brutality, homelessness, etc.), but it wrestles with them in such a ham-fised and overwrought way. Not a fan. Just finished Eric on Netflix and what started as a “Cumberbatch, Puppets, Mystery? Title is Eric? This is made for me!” led to me watching an incredible commentary on the 80’s, fatherhood, racism, and corruption. It felt like something Jim Henson would have been proud of pic.twitter.com/h9UVHPwS92"

4,Ada Enechi,"Jesse Eisenberg, Bigfoot, And Gallons Of Sweat – We Sat Down With ""Sasquatch Sunset"" Creators To Discuss The Creation Of One Of The Strangest Films In 2024",https://www.buzzfeed.com/adaenechi/sasquatch-sunset,"""I think it’s really fascinating how this creature represents our connection to the natural world""View Entire Post ›",2024-06-14T18:05:03Z,"""I think it’s really fascinating how this creature represents our connection to the natural world"" BuzzFeed Staff Starring Jesse Eisenberg and Riley Keough, we’re taken on a journey of the life of the mythical creatures that resides deep in the forest because we’ve all sat and pondered “what would Big Foot do with his day?” I’m just going to cut to the chase, what spawned this idea? What made you think yes I want to make a film about Sasquatch? David Zellner: Well, we've always loved Bigfoot and Bigfoot lore in general from when we were kids. We’ve always been fascinated with all forms of cryptids but particularly Bigfoot because it was regional to where we grew up and there's not much else in terms of American mythology. So as adults, what interested us was the way it represents this kind of grey area between human and animal behaviour and our connection to the natural world. It felt like there were some interesting things to explore as a story. The quote-unquote footage out there of it (Bigfoot) is all the same. All the sightings  are just bigfoot walking across the field over and over again and we were just like “Well, what else is it doing?” Well, they live a peaceful simple life... David: Haha, but you know, like any other animal you get to see a full spectrum of behaviour so that led us to want to explore more and approach it from that standpoint. This is also why we want to do it without any kind of filter of humans, who would then process the information you're seeing for you. So there’s no humans in the movie – you're telling the story through no voiceover, we wanted the audience to be immersed in their world without judgment. So far we know that humans are the only animals that exhibit shame, so we wanted to see what it would be like for these animals to have human-like characteristics – showing the full spectrum of their behaviour and treating it all in the same level playing field. Lore can be interpreted in so many ways and we all have our own theories, but what is Sasquatch to you? Do you have an idea of what they are? Nathan: Yeah, it's weird because there’s the very specific man in the woods thing but there’s always been this missing link to it. There’s the theory it’s something that didn’t evolve the same way because we have this relationship to primates and so this could be a Neanderthal or Cro-magnon or something like that. If there is any truth or validation to it, that's probably where a lot of the stories from way back came from. When the different stages of evolution happened and humans branched off maybe one got left behind and also became 8ft tall with mythical proportions because it was different.  David: I think it's interesting to have so many different parts of the world develop their own creature in the woods myth and all independently. For instance, the other most famous one is the yeti, another hairy creature in the woods. All centuries old, all developed independently from one another, I think it’s really fascinating how this creature represents our connection to the natural world and it’s always just tied to that.  People might have written about this I don't know but I’m curious if as human civilisation developed and we went from rural communities to more centralised cities, there was such a separation between humans and the natural world that this myth evolved to bring us back to earth. Does that make sense?  It makes sense, we constantly hear people longing to have been born in a time of less advancement and technology, with the need to go back to basics so that this creature was created. I too have always believed it was a Neanderthal that got left behind, but I always imagine they were by themselves so I love how you created this little family we follow through life, and all they do is walk across the woods because that’s all we’ve seen them do.  When creating the script, how and when did you decide not to have it in a language that anyone could understand? And how was this rehearsed between the actors? Nathan: Well, the script wasn't as long as a regular script, because it's kinda like a script where you’ve pulled all the dialogue out of so it was about 60 pages, but it was very detailed and specific. One because you don't have the benefit of relying on other forms of exposition to convey what the story is, and two because there's not an easy comp for this, this, this film. For everyone involved, from the financiers to the cast, to the crew, we needed to make it crystal clear what the tone was. It's a mix of the kind of humour and pathos in equal measure, and without it being that dialled in the script, I think it is easy for people's go-to responses to be “Oh, it's a horror movie” or something like that, so we just needed to be really clear from the outset what our tone was. The tone was very clear and it even got quite dark. I thought while watching that if the female sasquatch (Riley Keough) had a theme song it would be Reba’s “I’m A Survivor”  Nathan & David: haha that is so good! You were putting my girl through it! Did you add these dark tones to create a more human connection with the audience? Nathan: Well when exploring this kind of uncomfortable area between human and animal behaviour we knew there'd be humour in it because there’s there's behaviour in this film that you'd see your dog and cat do and you wouldn't think anything of it but if it's something with human-like qualities, it suddenly becomes uncomfortable. So we always knew that would be there. This is kind of way we like to work in general,  to mix the humour and the melancholy but it's always a very intuitive process and never forced because the story kind of tells us which way to go. We wanted to have a certain level of poignancy and in showing the whole spectrum of the human condition through these creatures you can be open to the the lighter moments in the darker moments in equal measure. Nathan you actually had the pleasure of playing one of the Sasquatches, can you share how long the process was getting into that costume and just how sweaty did that get? Nathan: Hahaha! It was GALLONS of sweat! I knew you were roasting in that suit! Nathan: Haha yes I was! We had a rehearsal period that started on Zoom and then when we met in person Jesse Eisenberg had brought in a movement coach that he had worked with prior. The rehearsal wasn't really to talk through emotional beats, I mean we do but it wasn't like rehearsing lines or anything like that, it was more like trying to just get everyone comfortable with behaving like an animal. We were learning how to react from our id and subconscious more and how to technically move so that we're all looking like a family, like a species.  There are a lot of rules that you can make up because there's only so much baseline to Bigfoot available, we built the movement off of the one famous video of it walking. It kind of lumbers and that gave us seeds to work from but a lot of it was taken from watching primate videos of how orangutans eat foods and hold things. Once you got that costume on it was a fully immersive process. it was really fun to disappear behind that makeup because you felt pretty uninhibited as you had about 40 pounds of fur on top of you. Thankfully, we shot kind of late in the fall so the weather, for the most part, was on our side, but there were a couple of days where the sun was just beating on you and you could just feel yourself baking underneath the costume. So when we would eventually pull it off the undersuit was just drenched in sweat. You finished filming two sizes smaller! David: Haha yes it was like a sweat sponge! It’s very different to a Planet of the Apes type film because you’re not as reliant on CGI and you’re really having to become this animal. Did you feel like immersing yourself so much in the character there were days you had to remind yourself to shake off the Neanderthal? Nathan: No no, because it wasn't as method as that. Most of the time in between takes, we were trying to conserve energy because it took so much energy. We wanted to do old-school prosthetics work and most of the time this type of work is done on sound stages and from a green screen so it's a little bit more controlled environment, so we had a lot of challenges. But from an acting standpoint, you’re usually worried about overacting, because when you're an actor it’s a lot about being subtle but when you have all this makeup on, you have to really project it and move through it. Even a slight head turn has to be a bigger movement so that you can get through the latex suits and the fur. So that was the biggest thing to learn from an acting standpoint. It’s very theatrical, almost taking it back to silent films... David: Yes because we’re big fans of silent films but it wasn’t until we started making it that we realised we have to kind of rewire our braids to convey information in a way we weren’t used to and hadn’t done before. thumbnail credits: Nbc / Nathan Congleton / NBC via Getty Images /Jon Kopaloff / Getty Images for Vanity Fair"

The car wasn't familiar, and neither were the men. They both got out of the car and approached my brother. They started asking him questions and moving closer to him. I remember feeling panicked. I had learned about stranger danger in school and knew this wasn't right. I ran around the side of the house, flew through the back door, and screamed, 'Someone is trying to kidnap Steve!' My dad didn't hesitate. He got up and flew through the front door. When the men saw my dad coming through the door, they bolted and peeled out. From that day forward, we weren't allowed to play in the front yard anymore.""  u/Ambam3434 ""We had reported the car stolen and did the police reports when it happened. Well, two nights later in the middle of the night I hear a knock on the door and they said 'open up, it's the police'. Well, since I had heard the story about the other lady, I was suspicious and did not answer. I grabbed my kids and put them in my daughter's room because it had access to the roof from the window. I called the police to say that two men claiming to be police are pounding on my door. They said there was no police in the area and they're sending a car. Turns out, these same guys stole the car and came back for seconds. I did get my car back because they brought it with them."" u/BassIll9657 ""But he doesn't. He lingers and starts smoking.

Apparently she got this random 'go home NOW' urge. She hadn't even run her first errand yet but turned around immediately. Found the guy in our yard and asked what he needed. I guess he muttered something about looking for someone, or something to that effect, and my mum told him to leave. Apparently he was acting very strangely. To this day I have no idea what he wanted, and no idea how my mum knew to come home. But I am VERY grateful she did."" u/Willowed-Wisp ""I don’t remember why, exactly, but I was really scared and kept crying and asking if we could just go back to the hotel.

I told my wife to take my daughter and get in the car. It wasnt even raining yet and I was full on panic yelling for everyone to leave, something isn't right. No one else was that worried, mostly concerned with how I was acting. I went out to the car and as soon as I was about to turn the key the tornado sirens went off.  I look across the lake maybe a few miles in the distance and see a funnel cloud.

I can only assume that I subconsciously heard the branch starting to give.""  u/tomyownrhythm ""About five seconds later, a young woman jumps out of the bush directly ahead of me (maybe 50 feet away) on the left-hand side of the road, while waving her arms in the air and gesturing frantically for me to pull over. I swerved a bit to the right, slowing down even further, but I did not stop. She was young, maybe early 20's or even late teens, and a little dirty, and I was immediately conflicted over continuing to drive. But something told me not to stop under any circumstances. I got further up the road, slowed a little more, and dialed 911 with one shaky hand. The dispatcher said she'd send someone to check, but encouraged me not to feel bad. Apparently there had already been calls about this girl over the last hour, and they were unable to find her when police followed up. I heard a few weeks later about some car-jacking/robbery attempts in the area. Very relieved I listened to my instincts that night.""  u/stillgot1111t ""I was luckily on the other side of the door at that moment and pushed it back closed with all my force and began screaming, I managed to security lock the front door and text my apartment block for help. I was on the second floor, and they obviously watched which apartment I went into.

The block then quickly changed the gates to a mechanic lock that cannot be pulled apart."" u/Odd_Llama800   ""I ended up going to our upstairs employees-only section to fold boxes (up there all alone down a hallway where nobody would hear me). I ended up feeling sick to my stomach as I heard someone walk up the stairs and whispering and I closed the door and turned my music off and texted my mum. The two followed me up there, then tried to go down the unlocked hallway but another waitress noticed them bothering me and caught them trying to come after me. I just had a gut feeling as I heard them coming. She came down the hallway and told me to be quiet and hold our body weight against the door. We waited for them to leave as they stood there, waiting for me to come out before making some remarks about not knowing where I was then going back down. My dad came and picked me up early because I just felt so off. The following day I had to come in for another shift and as I was clocking out the TV’s started playing a true crime documentary on a girl with the same name as me who was kidnapped and assaulted by two men. My stomach dropped and shortly gave my notice after that. I realised I wasn’t going to be protected there and wouldn’t be surprised if they returned again.""  u/Mack_turnzie ""I don’t know what came over me but I picked up my friend’s girlfriend and started walking to the door. She was kicking the entire time and the rest of the party followed me outside telling me to put her down. When we got outside, we heard the distant 'pop pop' and people screaming. We looked at each other for a second then ran for our cars. I forgot to put her down and was still carrying her over my shoulders."" u/ZestyGolf7654 u/bbbbbthatsfivebees ""I hopped on my bike in my underwear and rode a mile to the top of the campground where the showers were.

In an Instagram post, model Bella Hadid wrote: ""Palestine on my mind, in my blood and on my heart. Always… If you don’t know what’s happening right now in Gaza, watch my stories (and find other accounts leading to Palestinians on the ground) and please educate yourself on the on going occupation and genocide that is happening RIGHT NOW in Gaza. Do not be desensitized to the horror that is being endured by the Palestinian people."" On Oct. 10, Gigi Hadid posted the following on Instagram: ""My thoughts are with all those affected by this unjustifiable tragedy, and every day that innocent lives are taken by this conflict–too many of which are children. I have deep empathy and heartbreak for the Palestinian struggle and life under occupation, it's a responsibility I hold daily. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them included harm of a Jewish person."" She and her sister Bella also jointly donated $1 million to humanitarian efforts in Gaza.  Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan has been incredibly busy with press events supporting Season 3 of the hit Netflix series, and she's rarely seen out without her ceasefire pin. The 37-year-old has raised $1.2 million for the Palestine Children’s Relief through social media campaigns, and has shut down voices in the industry who have told her she will not get future work if she continues her advocacy.  “You do get told, ‘You won’t get work,’ ‘You won’t do this.’ But I also think, deep down, if you know that you’re coming from a place of ‘I don’t want any innocent people to suffer,’ then I’m not worried about people’s reactions,” the actor told Teen Vogue.   Singer The Weeknd — aka Abel Tesfaye — has made two large donations in support of Palestinians. The first was a $2.5-million donation in December 2023 aimed at providing 820 metric tons of food parcels to feed Palestinians; and the second was a $2-million donation from his XO Humanitarian Fund in April. The money went toward 18 million loaves of bread for struggling families in Gaza, Variety reports.  A long-standing and vocal advocate, singer Kehlani (who uses she/they pronouns) used their ""Next 2 U"" music video to take a hard stance on the war. In addition to dancing in front of the Palestinian flag, Kehlani ended the video with the following message: “We tried to make a scroll honoring the names of thousands of deceased children,” it reads. “The list was so long that our fastest scroll at 3 minutes was illegible.” So, they included a full list in the description.  They also shared a series of videos on Instagram, in which Kehlani called out industry peers who have been silent on the war. ""Nothing we do has a fucking purpose without people and you can’t turn the fuck around and reach back for people? You can’t speak? Disgusting!” she said.  Wednesday actor Jenna Ortega has previously shared a link to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund on her Instagram story, according to Teen Vogue, and posted the photo below on Instagram with the message: ""Masses debating over a ceasefire while thousands upon thousands of children continue being slaughtered. Where is the humanity."" At a pro-Palestine march in Washington, DC, singer Macklemore found himself being handed a mic and offering an impromptu speech. He said: ""I didn’t expect to be on a microphone. There are thousands of people here more qualified to speak on the issue of a free Palestine than myself. But I will say this. They told me to be quiet. They told me to do my research, to go back, that it’s too complex to say something, right? To be silent in this moment. In the last three weeks I’ve gone back and I’ve done some research … I’m teachable. I don’t know enough. But I know enough that this is a genocide."" On May 28, singer Dua Lipa shared a slide from the Artists4Ceasefire organization, along with the message: “Burning children alive can never be justified. The whole world is mobilizing to stop the Israeli genocide. Please show your solidarity with Gaza."" Ariana Grande re-shared Nicola Coughlan's post to raise funds for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund on her Instagram story.  Euphoria actor Hunter Schafer was arrested at a February protest in support of Palestinians at NBC headquarters. The demonstration, organized by Jewish Voice for Peace NYC, took place ahead of President Joe Biden's appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers.  The group criticized Biden for his role in the war via providing arms to Israel, NBC News reported.  Hunter was escorted out by police while wearing a ceasefire shirt.  Former And Just Like That... actor Sara Ramirez previously shared support for a ceasefire and photos of themself at pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Instagram before they removed their account.  In an Instagram post, the rapper and actor wrote: ""I can't watch what's happening in the world and remain silent. I can't imagine the pain people are feeling. Seeing their entire neighborhoods bombed, losing generations of family members, parents crying over their children's lifeless bodies, communities turning into mass graves, people digging through the rubble of their homes in hopes of finding remains of their loved ones – a pain no one should have to go through. ...The collective punishment Palestinians are suffering under Israel's illegal occupation is unfathomable. Anti-semitism is never welcome. But let's be clear – supporting Palestinian liberation is not antisemetic, it's human. Palestinians deserve freedom. This isn't politics, these are real lives. And I'm just a dude who gives a fuck about humanity. I stand with the people of Palestine."" In January, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters descended on Sundance to share their message, and Pose actor Indya Moore was among them. Chants rang out, including calls to ""Free Palestine"" and ""Stop the genocide,"" according to the Hollywood Reporter. Over a microphone, Indya said: “I’m gay as — God forgive me — fuck. I love everybody. I love people. I have Israeli friends. I have Jewish friends. I have Palestinian friends. Everybody sees what’s happening. They all agree, there needs to be a ceasefire. Stop telling us to hate each other. Stop telling us they hate each other. They also know that the Palestinian children that have been murdered are not responsible for freeing the hostages right now. That’s just the truth, right? The children are innocent.” Indya Moore was not the only actor to make an appearance at the previously mentioned demonstration. They were joined by former Scream actor Melissa Barrera, who was recently fired from Scream 7 after referring to the happenings in Gaza as ""genocide,"" ""ethnic cleansing,"" and ""like a concentration camp."" In response to her firing, Spyglass, the company behind Scream 7's production, released the following statement: “Spyglass’ stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.""  Since then, the film's director and costar Jenna Ortega have dropped from production.  Poor Things actor Ramy Youssef was among many artists who sported ceasefire pins at the 2024 Oscars. When asked about it, he told Variety: “We’re calling for immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza. We’re calling for peace and lasting justice for the people of Palestine. It’s a universal message of, ‘Let’s stop killing kids. Let’s not be part of more war.’ No one has ever looked back at war and thought a bombing campaign was a good idea. To be surrounded by so many artists who are willing to lend their voices, the list is growing. A lot of people are going to be wearing these pins tonight. There’s a lot of talking heads on the news, this is a space of talking hearts. We’re trying to have this big beam to humanity.” Actress and long-time activist Susan Sarandon was dropped by her talent agency after making an appearance at a pro-Palestine rally, where she said, “There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.” Further, ""There’s a terrible thing that’s happened where antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel. I am against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.” She has since apologized after her words were viewed as anti-Semitic. "

Her husband stayed pretty quiet and defaulted to going along with whatever she said about her being the victim in all of this and how she was going to write to the airline to get the flight attendant fired. This past September, there was an upcoming trip involving her, and the rest of the group had an internal discussion where one girl agreed to be the person to tell her that she had changed, that she was a very rude person now, that she had serious issues she needed to work on, and that we were uninviting her to the trip and refunding her the tickets. Contact with her has been minimal — and we in the friend group have noticed an improvement in our social gatherings.

Around 2009, my sister called me, hysterical, saying that our friend Derek had passed away. It kind of hit me like a splash of cold water. I was stunned and in denial. There was no way...Anyway, I reached out to our old friend group (Rob and some others who joined the group after they'd graduated). They weren't good people, so consequently, I'd stopped hanging out with the group. Rob just attracted that sort of crowd, and Derek was just one of those see-good-in-everyone types. The story I was able to piece together was this: One of the newly-joined friends to the group was getting married, so this night was his bachelor party. They started at a strip club, but another in the group suggested that they should end the night in the next state over so they could gamble at a casino. Derek went and withdrew... a couple thousand in cash so he could pay for the groom-to-be to gamble and maybe some others in the group who may have been struggling at the time so everyone could be part of the celebration. While at the strip club, one of the dancers noticed that Derek had a lot of cash. ... She started to be extra clingy with him and eventually asked what he was doing when they were done. He told her the plan. Well, she wanted to tag along and just hang with him while everyone else was partying it up since he was more laid back. ... He agreed, and the plan was for her to leave work, go home, and change, and they could pick her up there. Once they got to her place, he knocked on the door. The dancer's boyfriend was waiting to ambush my buddy for his cash. He ran around the side of the house and hit him square in the face. My buddy was two sheets to the wind at this point, so there was no bracing for the hit or any expectation of anything other than picking up a cute girl. He went down like a sack of potatoes and landed straight on the back of his head. He was bleeding everywhere, and the 'friend group' all finally noticed what was going on, and they ran out to help him. They got him back into the car and drove him home. They had to drive past THREE hospitals to get to his house. He was unconscious and bleeding all over the back of the car. They got him home, a whole hour away from where this all happened. He didn't live in our hometown anymore, so they took him to his mother's house. They left him on the couch and told his mother that he just had a lot to drink. (They must have cleaned him up by this point.) She thanked them for bringing him home 'safely.' The next morning, it was getting late into the day, and Derek's mother got worried and tried to wake him up. He had passed away in his sleep. His mother and sister never really got over the whole thing. He really was a shining light in the lives of many, myself included. I wasn't there, so some of the information I was given I can't really take to heart, but a lot seem to believe that this was all a setup, and when they took him to his mother's house, they knew they shouldn't have. They just wanted a quick cash grab, I guess? I never thought a few thousand dollars was worth our friend's life. I still think about him today and how I haven't seen his mother or his sister in years. They don't live in the same house anymore. The funeral was the last time we were all together. ... I don't really speak to the group anymore. As a matter of fact, when someone from those early days in my life asks about our old group, I get kind of angry and upset inside and wish I knew what really happened and why the hell they decided to neglect medical care for someone who wouldn't have done the same to them."" —u/RedcrosKnight Submissions have been edited for length/clarity."

Our bus driver, Jeannie, had no idea what was going on until this mass of vomit pooled on the steps for the door. She slammed on the brakes, stood up, turned around, yelled, 'What in the hell is going on here!?' and then immediately figured it out. I still remember the look on her face today, almost thirty years later — revolt, realization, horror, and confusion about what to do next, all in one facial expression. She radioed into the school to have as much kitty litter as possible available and that they'd likely have to call in someone to clean it up. So we arrived at the school after traveling the last few miles in this stench, and there was the principal and the school nurse. Jeannie opened the door, and it had become a literal floodgate, and I remember the nurse going running. We stayed in our seats until they figured out what to do—they couldn't have all the students wading in puke. In the meantime, with the bus no longer moving and fresh air coming in, more kids started to puke. They eventually realized there was no getting around it and put down towels for us to walk on. Thankfully, nobody slipped and fell into the river. We all went to the gym, where they did their best to clean up our shoes, but that smell stays on you. I recall hearing that in some other classrooms, the smell made other kids puke throughout the day. I will never forget that day, nor will anyone else who went to that school. From that point forward, all the buses had spilled powder in a little box behind the driver's seat, and we were instructed to tell the driver immediately if anyone puked again.

BuzzFeed Contributor The Stranger Things actress is the daughter of Ethan Hawke, and boldly shared her take with the Times on nepotism. She said, ""There are so many people who deserve to have this kind of life who don’t, but I think I’m comfortable with not deserving it and doing it anyway. And I know that my not doing it wouldn’t help anyone."" She continued, ""I saw two paths when I was first starting and one of them was: change your name, get a nose job, and go to open casting roles."" Jamie Lee Curtis, who more recently starred in the award-winning film Everything Everywhere All at Once, addressed being a ""nepo baby"" at the 2023 SAG Awards after receiving the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor award. E! News reports she emphasizes that she didn't come from much. ""My sister Kelly and I were born from love and my father was from Hungary and my mother was from Denmark and they had nothing and they became these monstrous stars in this industry that they loved so much."" She continues, ""My parents were actors and I married an actor. I know you'll look at me and think, 'Well, nepo baby. That's why she's there' — and I totally get it. But the truth of the matter is, I'm 64 years old and this is just amazing."" In a recent issue of W magazine, Dylan Penn, daughter of Sean Penn and actress Robin Wright admitted that she could ""see being really pissed that I got this role, as someone else,"" after she was cast in the 2021 drama Flag Day by her father, the film's director. Yet, she followed up defending her craft, saying, ""I've been auditioning forever. I've been rejected forever."" Dylan also stressed the importance of relationships in addition to talent. ""This is the business. It is about who you know. Always. Whether you're the son of Sean Penn or not."" In January 2023, Kaia Gerber, the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber, told Elle in an exclusive interview that nepotism exists but has its limits. She stated: ""No artist is going to sacrifice their vision for someone's kid. That just isn't how art is made, and what I'm interested in is art. No one wants to work with someone who's annoying, and not easy to work with, and not kind. Yes, nepotism is prevalent, but I think if it actually was what people make it out to be, we'd see even more of it."" The American Horror Story actress then went on to express immense gratitude, saying: ""Even if it's just the fact that I have a really great source of information and someone to give me great advice, that alone I feel very fortunate for."" O'Shea Jackson Jr., the son of rapper and actor Ice Cube, who also played the role of his father in the film Straight Outta Compton, tweeted, ""I had to get my ass up and make it work."" He went on, emphasizing that, ""leaving HIS agency and goin to find a team of my own,"" was one of the hardest parts of putting himself on the map. He ended with the confirmation that his work does and always speaks for itself. ""Once the door was opened it was up to me to walk through it and thrive."" Lily Allen, the daughter of actor Keith Allen and producer Alison Owen, tweeted, ""The nepo babies y’all should be worrying about are the ones working for legal firms, the ones working for banks, and the ones working in politics, if we’re talking about real-world consequences and robbing people of opportunity.""  According to E! News, Emma Roberts, the daughter of Eric Roberts, was one of the first celebrities to speak out against the assumption that being Julia Roberts's niece contributed to the success. The Madame Web actress spoke out earlier in her career, saying, ""...they talk about nepotism which I think is so ridiculous considering it's obviously not true — because I've auditioned for so many things and never gotten the part. Also, it's like, you know, maybe someone can get you one part, but they can't really get you 10 parts."" Elizabeth Olsen, the sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, unveiled to Glamour UK in 2021 her awareness that her privilege came young, but she still pushed against it, thinking to herself, ""I don’t want to be associated with [Mary-Kate and Ashley], for some reason."" She continued, ""I guess I understood what nepotism was like inherently as a 10-year-old. I don’t know if I knew the word, but there is some sort of association of not earning something that I think bothered me at a very young age. It had to do with my own insecurities, but I was 10."" Though living in the shadows of her sisters' fame took its toll, she didn't let it hinder the pursuit of her vision for herself. She concluded with, ""I don’t know how much I processed, but I did think, ‘I’m going to be Elizabeth Chase'...when I become an actress."" Ben Stiller, son of the late Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, both profound entertainers, took a more direct approach when brought into the conversation, via X, saying, ""Diversity is much bigger issue. No question. And I see your point, access is access. So yes. I’m saying that untalented people don’t really last if they get a break because of who they are or know or are related to."" Being the daughter of a legendary star in Hollywood cannot be easy for anyone because it's a given that all eyes are always on you. This was the case for Jane Fonda, the daughter of Henry Fonda, who exclusively told Harvard Business Review, ""I wanted to be sure that I wasn’t getting parts because I was Henry Fonda’s daughter, so I worked harder. Instead of taking one class a week, I would take four, so no one could say I was a dilettante."" Sometimes that backfired, but eventually it worked in her favor. ""When I had the chance to go to France to make a movie with René Clément and get away from the shadow of my father, I jumped at it."" Though some call it nepotism, others call it support. Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of Parenthood's Ron Howard, told the Daily Beast in 2021 that ""it's a privilege for that person to have success in their own right. But there was no greater privilege than the fact that my dad was supportive of me, empowered me, and showed me respect — real respect — from day one."" She continued by saying, ""Insecurities can creep up or you'll hear somebody say, like, 'Oh, she only got that because of X, Y, or Z.' But that's very small."" In other words, haters are going to hate, keep perfecting your craft, and following your dreams. Drew Barrymore, the daughter of John Barrymore, could be considered one of those celebrities who was born to shine, even if she didn't want to. Her personality alone sets her apart. The Charlie's Angels actress stated on her talk show that ""if you came from a family of lawyers, and someone said, 'Oh, well, her dad runs the firm,' it's like, 'Well, she still took the bar and got here of her own volition.' So as long as we’re not catty about it and celebratory of it, that’s the tone I want."" In an interview with Net-a-Porter, the Euphoria actress Maude Apatow, firstborn of Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, admitted her disappointment in being associated with nepotism. ""A lot of people [in similar situations] have proven themselves over the years, so I've got to keep going and make good work. It's so early in my career, I don't have much to show yet, but hopefully one day I'll be really proud of the stuff I've done by myself."" Denzel Washington's son John David Washington weighed in on the conversation in an August interview with Mr. Porter. The BlacKkKlansman actor disclosed that as his career grew, he did notice that ""people changed"" especially when they discovered he was Denzel's son. However, he never embraced that; in fact, he hid his identity often. ""I used to lie, saying he was a construction worker or in jail, just to have some sense of normalcy. I felt like there was no way people would take me seriously, even if I was good."""

We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility."" HuffPost Writer I was settling in for an interview over Zoom when I glanced at my baby monitor and saw it: the unmistakable wiggle of a toddler who’d pooped himself awake from a nap. I sighed and set the monitor aside. I had no choice but to wait till after the call to check on him. When the Zoom ended, I dashed in to clean him up, then texted my friend a photo of the three of us (my baby, myself and my laptop). “Look at me,” I wrote wryly. “I have it all.” I started thinking a lot about “having it all” after my son was born in late 2021. I went back to work after four months of parental leave, breast-pumping my way through phone calls and changing diapers on the sly. I loved being close to my son and was lucky to have a husband who thrived as a stay-at-home dad, but it was all so completely exhausting. For every stolen midday snuggle there was sobbing (on both sides of the door) when I had to close my eyes and tune out my son’s cries for Mommy as I buckled down to get a project done.  Surely, I often thought to myself, this isn’t what Helen Gurley Brown had in mind when she published “Having It All,” her famed book of advice on balancing sex, work, relationships and more, in 1982. I may have a career and a family, but I often “have it all” — or, rather, do it all — at the exact same time.  In the summer of 2012, just a couple of years into my journalism career, The Atlantic published Anne-Marie Slaughter’s culture-defining text, “Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.” In it, she described stepping back from powerful government work to be closer to home and more available to her two teenage sons, and she outlined the workplace changes she saw as necessary to allow ambitious women to pursue big careers and remain present mothers.  I read it hungrily, feeling smug about my own ambivalence toward motherhood. At 25, I was climbing the career ladder fast and loving it. Why derail the train with a baby when the ride was so exciting? Plus, I couldn’t imagine a world where Slaughter’s proposed changes — more flexible schedules, remote work, less business travel, teleconferencing instead of in-person meetings — would materialize. Little did I know a global pandemic would abruptly shift that tide. A decade later, in a post-COVID world, I had, in many ways, exactly what Slaughter had described: an exciting career with a flexible, remote job that allowed me to be close to the baby I’d decided I wanted. But I also had a hefty dose of burnout. For me, it was all too much — the constant doing it all. And I was losing my ambition as a result.  I’m not the first millennial mom with an office job to feel this way. Between lazy girl jobs, the death of the girlboss and the countless ambitious women who’ve written about losing their drive in recent years, the collapse of millennial women’s ambition is well-documented. Heck, we now even have the millennial mom midlife crisis.  But it’s no wonder: Millennial moms work more than previous generations of mothers, and we spend more time parenting our kids, plus our parents can’t or don’t want to help us out (or need care themselves). And then there’s the astronomical cost of child care. We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility.  I decided to ask Anne-Marie Slaughter what comes next. Slaughter acknowledged that we’ve made strides toward her envisioned workplace, but we’re not there yet.  “We’ve transitioned the where we can work, and we have the flexibility — so now, if your kid is sick or you have a teacher’s conference or you need to take a parent to a doctor’s appointment, you have the flexibility to do that,” she said. But we haven’t reached the place where professional and personal ambition can coexist. Aside from major structural changes we know are needed to support families — such as 12 months of parental leave, plentiful and affordable child care, free pre-kindergarten and well-funded public schools — there is one big thing that needs to change in the workplace, according to Slaughter: management practices. Face time is still the reigning tool for performance measurement, and that disadvantages anyone working remotely. “If you’re in the office and that other person is in the office, you are still going to have a better sense that they are working than the person who is not [in the office],” she said. “I’ve said for a long time, to really make this work, you have to have much more objective and precise management practices, and that takes more work. I don’t think we’re there yet.” Indeed, McKinsey’s Women in the Workforce reports from both 2022 and 2023 found that women in leadership are leaving their roles in record numbers, in part because their labor isn’t being recognized by their superiors. They’re taking on diversity, equity and inclusion work or heading up employee resource groups in addition to their full-time roles, for example, but it’s not being counted toward their overall performance, and they’re working remotely (often to juggle family responsibilities), which is being counted against them.  “They are looking for the ability to advance. They are looking for flexibility and choice in terms of where, when and how they work. They are looking for companies that authentically prioritize DE&I. They are looking for people who are backing their careers,” said McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee in a podcast about the 2022 report. But, quite frankly, she said, “companies haven’t stepped up.” Beyond changes in performance evaluation and management, Slaughter also advocates for what she described in her Atlantic article as “investment intervals,” the idea that you grind hard in certain periods of your work life ― early in your career before you have kids, for example ― and then make different choices as your career moves forward, including saying no to promotions that won’t work for your family life or taking time off from full-time work to consult, take a sabbatical or accept project-based work. Then when your kids are grown, you can lean back in and keep rising. In my view, when it comes to frazzled millennial moms, a wholesale shift in the way we understand and reward professional ambition is due. Forget this idea that moving up, down, back or sideways in your career is a sign that you’re not committed. Instead, we must think of ambition as a tide — sometimes rolling in, sometimes rolling out, always doing its part. Under this rubric, millennial moms aren’t losing their ambition, they’re simply moving with the tide, and there’s no reason to feel ashamed about that. We shouldn’t be sent back to square one in our careers simply because the tide of our ambition went out while our children needed us most. Slaughter said that taking a break to have kids or to work on professional development isn’t the kiss of death that it used to be, but “there are still plenty of workplaces where, if you get knocked off that straight-up path, it’s going to be very, very hard to get back on. I can see it changing; it just hasn’t changed yet.”  At her company, New America, Slaughter said she’s found that a flexible and supportive culture, which includes hybrid work, paid parental leave and a “family comes first” mantra, has ensured the work always gets done without sacrificing people’s personal lives and has also helped more junior staff find opportunities to rise and be seen. Parental leave, for example, “creates opportunities for other people, younger people, other members of the team” to step in and work with Slaughter and other senior staff who they might not have otherwise crossed paths with directly. “It builds resilience in the workplace.” Slaughter sees millennial and Gen Z workers rejecting the old hustle-culture model and applauds it, but also notes that many of us aren’t sure where to go from here. “There’s a sense that the world that we knew is coming apart in many ways, and people are not sure what they should be wanting,” she said. “But they know that the traditional whatever it was that was going to make you happy is not likely to.”  That said, she thinks the idea of striving to be a “whole, healthy person” is a move in the right direction. “By whole, I really do mean having different dimensions to your life. That could be work and family, that could be sports, hobbies, friendships.”  She doesn’t even use the phrase “having it all” anymore. “The whole framing makes me uncomfortable, even though that is the phrase I grew up with that meant having a career and a family,” she said. “There’s a hyper-capitalist dimension to it” that runs counter to the way most millennials and Gen Zers think about their lives. It’s time we tossed it for good and focused on building workplaces that support the multidimensional lives of all workers. As for our millennial mom midlife crises and waning ambition? Slaughter advises us all to hang in there.  “It is a life passage that many, many, many people go through. We are maturing into our fuller selves who realize that there’s more to life and there’s more to ambition. I have plenty of ambition. It’s just not expressed in the way that it once was, to climb to the top of a particular ladder.”This article originally appeared on HuffPost."

I don't think I went a minute without a radio, 8-track, cassette, or record going around me except at dinnertime. I feel like I had a soundtrack to my life for the entire decade.  Music was always just 'there.' Almost every song from the '70s brings back specific memories of where I was, or who I was with, or what I was feeling. Everyone listened to the same couple radio stations, so if you dedicated a song to someone chances were they would actually hear it. You brought your records to house parties.  Concerts were the biggest party of all. You spent half your summer either trying to make enough money to buy tickets or trying to score tickets.

Instead, you should picture it as one of those scrunchy hair ties. Picture making a 'bird head' by closing all your fingertips on one hand together. Putting the small scrunchy around your closed fingers and then opening and closing them gets bigger and smaller again. Estrogen is what makes the hymen most pliable—most scrunchy. When we are born, we have leftover Estrogen from our mother for a couple of years. Our hymen is really pliable then.

Senior Editor If you work in corporate America, this might also be the time when your company changes its profile pic on social media to the company logo in rainbow colors and pats itself on the back for doing ""allyship."" Politically, Republican legislators in several states have banned gender-affirming care for transgender youth and taken aim at drag performances and Pride events. In the business realm, companies like Target, which once boasted big Pride displays in their stores, have scaled back their offerings due to conservative protest. LinkedIn's data shows that although 66% of the LGBTQ+ professionals they surveyed feel that they have an ally at work, 75% still feel pressure to ""code switch.""  In the sketch, Jordan Peele, playing Barack Obama, greets Black and white audience members at one of his speeches in very different ways, switching between a slangy AAVE vernacular and more white-coded speech depending on who he's interacting with.  57% said they did not feel comfortable with sharing their identity at work, 44% feared being treated differently, 40% hoped that code-switching would help them move up the ladder, and 36% did it out of fear of facing hostility from management and/or coworkers. In the report, Chau mentions that they went from working in places where they did not feel safe to be out as a nonbinary person to founding a company where inclusivity is an essential value, not just something to pay lipservice to every June. Chau explained, ""Growing up, I worked at my family’s restaurant, and some of the staff there were quite homophobic. I spent numerous years being harassed and bullied at work, and I had to just bear with it. I wasn’t — and couldn’t be — out at work because that would mean coming out to my family. I had to code-switch constantly. By the end of the workday, I would be extremely fatigued not just from the physical exertion but also the mental exhaustion of playing a different persona."" ""He wanted everyone to exist as they are, and that was the first time I felt like I didn’t have to hide under a 'work self.' I didn’t have to worry about the pitch of my speaking voice, and I was free to dress in ways that veer from gender norms without judgment. It was liberating. Both of these very different experiences have informed the kind of work environment I wanted to create for my own company."" ""For example, when I bring conversations about current events into the workplace, I show up as my authentic self. That means talking about my experiences as a queer POC navigating the world, as well as casual topics like the latest season of Drag Race or Charli XCX's new album.""

BuzzFeed Staff  ""Four and a half years on [testosterone] here. I’ve always been boyish, so my friend group and fashion sense stayed the same. The main change I noticed was how others treated me. I get asked to help move stuff more and don’t get told to 'smile more' or get leered at by strangers, which is such a blessing I didn’t even consider.  Physically, I’m stronger, my proportions changed, and my feet grew and height increased. T didn’t make me aggressive, just very *excitable*. Overall, I am so damn happy I made the decision to transition, no matter if people have negative opinions on my identity. I am loved and cherished still, and my mental health has skyrocketed over the last four years."" —witchystar55 ""FTM, transitioned at 19. To be honest, I haven’t noticed that much difference in how people treat me. The biggest difference is that HRT has made my emotions a lot steadier, and I’m way more confident. It’s also weirdly difficult to cry —apparently, it has something to do with hormones changing your tear ducts."" —wes7887 ""I transitioned from female to male, and the biggest physical differences I've noticed are in how my body processes being cold and needing to pee. Before, when I was in either of those situations, they felt IMMEDIATE and UNBEARABLE. Being on testosterone makes them both things where I'm like, 'I should deal with that at some point,' but it doesn't need to be NOW.  Also, people like to talk about how much more rational men's clothing sizes are, but I haven't found that to be true at all. A 31-inch waist fits me very differently in different brands and even different styles in the same brand."" —anonymous ""A lot of my friends have completely forgotten that I’m not a cis male and will talk/joke about certain things. And when I bring up something from my past about being raised a girl or not having a dick, they are dumbfounded, trying to rack their brain around how that’s possible, LOL."" —anonymous ""Trans man here. I am honestly so shocked by how much easier life is for me now that I’m fully passing. I’m treated with so much more respect, and I no longer feel unsafe in most public areas. I don’t know if this is the same for every trans man, but I really do feel that now I am a man, the world feels structured to benefit me entirely. I’m not inherently happy about this, obviously. I’m just constantly reminded of how truly awful life can be for women."" —anonymous ""I am treated completely differently [than] before my transition. To everyone, I was just one of those girls that always hung out with the boys. A major tomboy. Once I started hormones, I felt more like myself, and finally, everyone was able to start seeing who I saw all along. It was much harder before I passed. For those who don't know, 'passing' is when a trans person is seen as a cis person. Once I started passing, I was more welcome into male spaces.  Very few people at my current workplace know my trans status. I am seen as a cis male consistently for the first time in my life. It opened me up to a world of guy talk, which is wild. I honestly thought guy talk was a made-up thing in movies. But it's real, and I'm here to tell you that there are certain things men will not say in 'mixed company.' After being at my workplace for almost two years, it doesn't faze me anymore."" —anonymous ""I'm over 30 and out as FtM for three years. I absolutely love that strangers are no longer asking and judging me about kids ('Do you have any/why not/when/who's gonna take care of you later?'). I also feel much more self-assured, nobody is second-guessing my technical competence (I work in IT), and as an extension, I am not second-guessing myself, either. I genuinely feel much more at ease and comfortable, and I'm happier. I also don't hesitate to speak up for either myself or others, and interestingly, I've become much less tolerant of misogyny and sexism in general."" —anonymous ""This may be silly — or just plain obvious — but the men’s restroom is almost always in worse condition than the women’s restroom. I’ve seen unspeakable things stuffed in toilets, smeared on walls, and pooled at the bottom of stalls. It reminds me of that saying, 'You never know what you have until it’s gone.' I miss relatively clean public restrooms, but I am also way too dysphoric-ly stubborn to use the women's outside of absolute emergencies."" —anonymous ""Cis men really don't seem to wash their hands in bathrooms, at ALL."" —anonymous ""I was assigned female at birth and began transitioning in my early 20s. I began 'passing' as a straight, cisgender male and noticed how I felt safe walking alone. People didn't bother me as much. I noticed that when I did group assignments, people would listen to me more and talk over me less. This all sparked a lot of feelings inside me, and it helped me work through a lot of internalized misogyny. If it hasn't already been done, someone needs to write a paper on the difference in culture between the men's and women's restrooms. The men's room is generally a mess, and eye contact or quick greetings seem forbidden. I miss the camaraderie of the women's room all the time — the sharing of tampons, a quick heads-up if the toilet paper is low, and a shoulder to cry on during a drunken meltdown. Now it's one stall that's being used by someone watching YouTube loudly on their phone and Zyn pouches lining the urinals. Love it."" —anonymous ""I transitioned from female to male. There are a lot of differences, but one I did not expect is that — before I passed as a man — I would offer car rides home to strange women my age I saw walking on the road in my town, especially in the cold winter. Now that I pass as a man, I feel as though they would immediately assume I intended something bad (understandable from their position), so I just keep driving and hope they get home safe. The instant solidarity and connection I formerly experienced with women is not as readily experienced with men. I had to come out as gay to my managers at work just to get them to stop teasing me for 'flirting' with the female receptionist my age, whom I'm friends with outside of work. Literally cannot be friends with women or go out to dinner with them without everyone assuming we're a couple."" —anonymous ""I'm transitioning FtM and passing most of the time. Women, when talking about reproductive issues or periods, pat my knee and say, 'You don't have to worry about that.' Doctors take me more seriously. I get fewer smiles back on the street. Uber and Lyft drivers don't try to make small talk, which I love. I still get clocked on the phone, and it's wild how condescending people are."" —anonymous ""I've never experienced the men vs. women part; it's more that before I transitioned, I was catcalled a lot. [Now that I've] transitioned, I get left alone, which is lovely. The downside was I got a lot of harassment: things thrown at me by strangers in the street, threats, being filmed and harassed. I've also faced discrimination when applying for jobs."" —anonymous ""I've noticed quite a few differences. As a woman, men paid unwanted attention to me. When I corrected them, they'd laugh it off claiming it was harmless. If I needed help, men would come do it for me as opposed to showing me how best to do a job, or just assisting the extra muscle I may need."" —anonymous ""I am a transgender man who transitioned about 10 years ago. The first thing I noticed right away, especially being more of an opinionated 'nerd' type, is that I no longer had to bring backup to a discussion. I didn't have to google things to prove I was right about something. People just listened to me and believed me when I said things. It was a whiplash! Not that everything I say is always right, but people would actually engage with it instead of just being like, 'Oh, sweetie, you don't know what you're talking about.' Just in general, people treated me like I was another person on the same level and not in an infantilizing way. I did mourn the loss somewhat of not being seen as a threat to women, though. I felt like I lost the ability to communicate with women my age without them being guarded or suspicious, but I don't blame them at all. I was taught to do the exact same thing."" —anonymous ""FtM: Far less emotion (haven't cried in 15 years), far more body hair. :P  One thing that stands out was that when I was dining out with my ex-husband (not ex yet then, obviously), pre-transition, they would automatically give him the bill, and as soon as they clocked me as male, they asked if we wanted to split. Women are more weary of me now, I feel less comfortable complimenting both men and women for how that might come across, people don't interrupt me nearly as often now, and I feel like I'm taken more seriously, even if I'm spewing the same bullshit."" —anonymous ""I transitioned FtM nine years ago. One thing I will notice about the 'men vs. women' environments is that it is so much less scary in the world passing as a man. Men leave me alone or say, 'What’s up man?' whereas when I was a girl, I was terrified to walk down the street. I feel very lucky to be who I am, but I think the world has a lot to learn. Trans people are just people. That’s it."" —anonymous ""I’ve applied to jobs under my dead name and birth gender and never got a call back or any kind of acknowledgment that they received it. Applied to the same jobs as my new name and current gender and moved on to the interviewing process so fast."" —anonymous ""I transitioned MtF. One of the biggest differences was how small I started to feel. Taking hormones, shrinking muscles, and always being scared of what people are thinking about you and how you look. I'm 6 ft., but I would feel tiny when out with people."" —anonymous ""Men started opening doors for me, which I'm happy for now that I’ve lost my boy strength; I had to relearn basic tasks like opening heavy doors. Men are much more likely to help me with physically difficult things, warn me something is heavy, and unfortunately, mansplain and give unnecessary help with non-physical tasks. I’ve had a few gas station clerks ask for my number, or say I’m pretty and ask if I have a boyfriend. Ewwphoria at first. It quickly got old. Women are much more friendly and willing to help me, like offering to stand guard while I use a public restroom that won’t lock if I do the same for her or help me push my car out of a parking space when it wouldn’t start. Now they usually make eye contact and smile as we pass each other; I didn’t realize before just how separated these two genders are in public, but now I’m finally joining the half of the population that I should have been with from the start. Physically, the changes estrogen made to my body and mind feel absolutely wonderful. There are things I didn’t expect, like my feet shrinking and having to buy smaller shoes, and my thighs and butt getting too big even to pull my men’s pants up all the way, never mind buttoning them. I’m so glad my body odor smell changed for the better and is rarely even present; I can easily skip a shower or even two. Sunscreen is more important than ever, though, as is eating healthy if I want to feel well and stay in shape. And the loss of strength, wow…it was true what I heard about thinking you know what to expect, but being surprised when it happens; nothing could have prepared me. I struggled to enter a building a few times because opening doors isn’t even the same."" —slaughterdog ""I definitely can tell I am treated like less of a person after transitioning. I am MtF, and my ideas [are ignored], but then when a male says the same thing, they listen."" —anonymous ""I was a professional in the finance industry for eight years and was a senior member of my department and seen as a subject matter expert before I came out and began transitioning (MtF). My workplace was quite progressive and supportive, but when I changed my name and started using she/her pronouns, I noticed an immediate change in the way customers treated me. My expertise in my field was suddenly second-guessed or questioned where I was the authority before."" —anonymous ""Interestingly, my son told me I'm a far better mom than I ever was a dad!"" —anonymous ""As a trans woman, I have noticed that clothes shopping has become a lot more fun, and I am starting to notice that I am starting to be attracted to both men and women."" —anonymous ""I'm genderfluid and recently had top surgery. I do dress pretty femme most of the time, but the fact that everyone seems to think that I still have to cover my chest even though there are no breasts there anymore has me baffled! I literally have the same chest as a FtM person, but because I present femme, it's inappropriate. So weird!"" —chaoswitch ""I feel infinitely better in terms of my overall wellbeing. While dysphoria often can be related to your personal feelings about your body, people often underestimate the impact of social dysphoria: the distress caused not by your body image but by being constantly misidentified in public. It was so depressing always being called 'ma’am' in public no matter how I dressed or acted. I just was never read as male until I started testosterone, and it’s really nice not having people’s incorrect assumptions thrown in my face all the time.  One BIG thing I’ve noticed that I haven’t seen discussed much is the difference in how people treat you when they view you as a gender-nonconforming man vs. a gender-nonconforming woman. Before being on testosterone, I was always read as a butch lesbian, and now I’m read as a femme man. When people thought I was a butch lesbian, I was frequently treated with hostility, but that hostility was generally less overtly threatening. While I now am the beneficiary of male privilege, I’m also physically threatened and publicly harassed a lot more for being gender-nonconforming. I would get stares and under-the-breath comments before, whereas now I get open threats, yelled slurs, and loud comments intimating a desire to commit violence far more often. While I don’t want to downplay the negative experiences people read as butch women receive, I have observed that straight men are a lot more threatened by — and feel that they have more justification for being violent toward — effeminate men (and trans women) than people they read as butch cis women."" —anonymous ""I will say that one of my experiences as a mixed-race nonbinary trans man is that my treatment has gotten a lot worse than when people thought I was a woman. I am Choctaw and Iraqi, and now that I am perceived as a man, I often face an increase in racism. Which is depressing stuff, for sure! So let me tell you about the positives. My father accepted me immediately. After I came out as trans, he came out as bisexual. We've gone to Pride together multiple times and are able to be ourselves without fear when we're with each other.  My boyfriend and I can share a closet. I have saved so much money on my wardrobe, it's incredible. And in regards to my boyfriend, he has been sweet, compassionate, and understanding beyond belief.  When I got on testosterone, my body stopped hurting. For most of my life, I was a survivor of chronic pain and fatigue. When I got on T, both of them went away. I talked to my doctor, and we did some tests. It turns out that for most of my life, I suffered from a hormone imbalance caused by aromatase deficiency. Getting on T literally made my life easier. It also led to me getting tested and finding out that I am intersex, which is something I hold with a lot of pride. So, literally, because I am transgender and moved forward with transitioning, my physical health improved DRASTICALLY, and I learned something about myself that explained what my puberty was all about because it definitely wasn't typical. I promise it gets better, especially if you move to a more accepting area, like I did recently. All in all, it's been a beautiful journey, and I cannot wait to see what the future has in store."" —anonymous"

Instead, the temperatures Down Under have him rugged up. #stitch with @alexandratuohey  It's almost winter in Australia, which means most of us will have to contend with houses colder on the inside than temps are outside.  The World Health Organization consistently ranks Australian homes as some of the coldest in the world. For a home to be considered ""warm"" it must be above 18℃ inside. Yet studies have shown 81% of Aussie houses fail to meet that minimum standard.  🥶 Tasmania fared worst, with homes averaging 11 degrees during the winter.  😰 Over a quarter of Victorian homes fell below 14 degrees.  ☃️ And for any Queenslanders, sorry but the report didn't survey your homes (even though, yes, I know they can get brutally cold too).  But this isn't just an excuse to complain. It's actually a health and safety issue. Colder homes are dangerous for elderly and at-risk populations, increasing likelihood of hypothermia and potentially death. Lower temperatures are also perfect for mould and rising damp.  As climate change impacts weather around the world, issues like these are going to become even more apparent. Regulation, while long overdue, must now be fast-tracked to prevent the worst of outcomes.  #aussielife #aussiewinter #worldhealthorganization #australia #melbournelife @Jordie van den Berg  A report from last year even showed that 81% of Aussie houses had an internal temperature of less than 18 degrees celsius. This is the standard benchmark to be considered ""warm"".  If someone on TikTok could make a DIY series on insulating a home for under $10, that would be the best!  Give us some ideas in the comments below. "

She was pretty, smart, and loving. I also thought this would be a short relationship, but it lasted longer than I thought. I had no plan and no idea what to do to get out of it. Feeling the pressure from my parents and hers, I eventually asked her to marry. I didn't know what else to do.  It was terrifying. I couldn't see my future past the current day. Sex was atrocious. I had become the expert on giving every excuse in the book as to why I couldn't or didn't want to. It started weighing heavily on her, but she never became suspicious. She assumed something was wrong with her and it really started to affect her. I felt like an asshole.  One night, after three years of being married, she asked for intimacy, and I gave my 1,092nd excuse as to why I didn't want to. That was it. She had cried before, but this time, she couldn't stop. Crying uncontrollably. Thinking she was the problem. God, it was terrible. I couldn't take it anymore and at 4 in the morning that night I came out to her. It all made sense to her, and I literally watched the weight of the world lift from her shoulders. It was the best night and worst night of my life. I came out, but I was going to lose my best friend.  We separated and eventually got a divorce. I wanted to make sure she was going to be okay and paid for her therapy and paid all of her debt off. I felt like I owed her a lot. Fast forward 10 years later, and she and I are good friends. We can talk about the days past, and she holds no grudge. She remarried, had some kids, and is really enjoying life. I, too, found a partner and am very happy and feel liberated. Looking back, had I been strong enough to come out, none of that would have happened. But things happen for a reason, I believe. I have the utmost admiration for those who come out early and aren't afraid to be who they are.

The shade uses wind to keep it elevated and you get a nice cool spot in no time.  Promising review: ""This thing is fantastic! Light, durable, large enough to comfortably shade four or more adults either sitting on beach chairs or spread out on beach towels and blankets. We were in 15-20 mph prevailing SE winds off the Atlantic Ocean in Ft. Lauderdale and the Shibumi performed perfectly. Took less than five minutes to set up and break down. It was like carrying a handkerchief in your back pocket it was so convenient. I’m just mad at myself for not patenting and marketing it!! BTW — we were the only Shibumi in sight and we chuckled at the straining efforts and longer times it took others to set up their tents, canopies, flys or umbrellas in the stiff breeze. If you love the beach and you want convenient shade anytime, any place, anywhere, and you don’t own a Shibumi, tsk tsk. 😎"" —Nick Miller Get it from Amazon for $290. Promising review: ""The BEST sunscreen I have ever used! I am always prone to burn any time I get out in the sun. I decided to take a trip to the beach this summer and just went kayaking for four hours on the water in the BEAMING sun and in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY. I put sunscreen everywhere except for my chest. Wanna know where my skin is resembling that of a cherry? My chest. The rest of me? TANNING WITH NO BURN WHATSOEVER!!! I was shocked.

Promising review: ""I’ve tried many, many sunscreens that claim to blend and not leave a white cast when applied. This was so much better than I expected.

Purple Daisy Originals is a Georgia-based Etsy shop established in 2020 that specializes in personalized gifts.  Promising review: ""I love these cup holders for the sand.

We spent six hours at the beach the other day and I downloaded some of my TV from Netflix to catch up on and used a large towel and draped it over the sides of the headrest and had my own little personal theater in the fresh air! It's very light and easy to carry and the sand comes off super easily. The cushion around the face opening makes it super comfortable as well!!! Love this thing! —The Curl Girl Get it from Amazon for $57.51+ (available in nine colors).  These chairs also have a little sleeve on the back to hold your towel or other personal items for easy storage while sitting or even carrying it back to your room.

I made sure to wash my skin before application and it lasted about two days on my skin without coming off. When out of the sun or behind UV glass, like in a car, the spot turns clear. As soon as you step into the sun it turns purple. If you use a sunblock it starts to become clear or semi clear. After being on the beach and having gone into the water a few times the spot started turning purple and I applied sunblock again. In a minute the spot was clear again. So this is very effective in alerting me when to reapply."" —RGTorque Get a 16-count from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two quantities and a two-pack). Rumpl is an Oregon-based small business specializing in outdoor blankets that donates a portion of its revenue to environmental nonprofits. Promising review: ""This towel dries better than a conventional towel! Not only that but it was completely dry and ready to reuse in about 10 minutes. Normally we'd go through a stack of beach towels in one day. The towel itself is big but it packs up compact leaving more room in your bag for other things. It's soooo soft, made very well, and the pattern is gorgeous. I will be replacing all of my towels with these!!"" —Danielle W. Get it from Rumpl for $50+ (available in a variety of colors and styles here) or from Amazon for $31.50+ (available in six designs). You can also use this in your room to keep valuables protected.  Promising review: ""This is a must-have for vacations. We took it to Atlantis in the Bahamas. It worked perfectly. Held our phones, room keys, etc. while we were out enjoying the beach or pool. Just looped it to the beach chair or table. Highly recommended."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $39.95+ (available in five colors). To inflate, just move it through the air and trap the air by closing the sleeve opening before you're done moving. Make sure to keep the opening closed until you start your next inflating movement. I've always seen people doing a little running motion or a figure eight with it to fill it up with air quicker. I think it definitely requires a bit of trial and error but once you've done it a couple of times you'll get the hang of it! Promising review: ""I wanted to hang out in the beach and just lay down for a couple of hours. I tried foldable chairs but they were too heavy. I tried the Wekapo and it was the best solution. It packs to a small size, it's lightweight enough, and it elevates me enough from the sand."" —Rohan jcp Get it from Amazon for $33.98 (available in 20 colors). This speaker can last 24 hours on a single charge and it has a built-in power bank to charge your phone while you're jamming out. Promising review: ""I cannot understand how something this size can possibly produce such amazing loud clear sound and bass. It is a truly incredible device that I intend to use daily because it works well outside too. Do not be deceived by the affordable price, it is significantly better than a $400 version. The battery life is great too. If I want it loud, half the volume is all you need. If I want to blast my neighbors, 80% I haven’t needed to push it further. The bass-up function is awesome. You’re gonna love this thing. I bought it in blue to match all my other blue Soundcore devices and it’s gorgeous. Hope this helps."" —Rob and Piper Get it from Amazon for $129.99 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""My husband and I travel a lot and go to the beach/pool often. We have used these clips at least eight times now, and I am upset with myself for not purchasing them sooner. They come in handy, especially when it is windy. My husband and I recently visited a resort in the Dominican Republic where many lounge chairs were low-profile in the pool. Many guests at the resort asked us about the clips and where we got them because their towels were flying into the pool and then became soaking wet. We have used these clips on several types of lounge chairs, and we were able to clip towels onto even the thickest chairs with no problem. They stayed in place very well each time we used them. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I highly recommend purchasing these!"" —Megan G Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $5.99. Promising review: ""This is probably my new favorite beach/camping accessory. Well worth the money and love the teal color. When I posted pics online, my friends all wanted to know where I got it. The insulated bottom fits much more than I expected it to. I think I got like six cans of beer, four juice boxes, four sandwiches, and some grapes and ice too. I suggest filling the cooler up before the bag. I like the side pockets too. I was able to fit my book, glasses, and phone with room to spare. On the inside, I packed dry food and four rolled-up towels. The large straps made it easy to carry down to the beach. The bottom leaked a little ice water at the top, but it was at the zipper, and because I had it packed so full. I plan to use this for school sporting events and picnics too.""—Stacia Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""This cooler backpack is absolutely perfect. I plan on bringing it to the beach every time we go. It's actually very comfortable on my shoulders. No leaks and it keeps our beverages and snacks nice and cool! Would 100% recommend."" —Anjel Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in two colors). Promising review: ""I bought these shoes a couple of years ago before a river hike. UM THESE ARE AWESOME. They lasted a long time and the only reason I bought these yellow ones were because I wanted a new color, haha. My older pair did start to wear out in the toes from scraping them on rocks and such when hiking but still no holes in them. These shoes feel like socks but with enough of a sole that you can walk on gravel with no problem. It really is like walking barefoot. Also, these are the only water shoes that I have worn that do NOT let a bunch of debris into the shoe making you constantly have to take it off to empty it or just deal with the irritant. You can play on the beach with minimal sand stuck between your toes. Thoroughly impressed by that. So with that, I do recommend if you are a half size to size down so they are snug, otherwise the sock like ability to keep stuff out might not work so well."" —Samantha Lindsay  Get it from Amazon for $9.88+ (available in seven sizes and 43 colors/patterns). The set comes with three collapsible pails, three shovels, and a mesh carrying bag. Promising review: ""These are great and fold down nicely for easy packing in our beach bag. They are an amazing quality and do not feel flimsy at all when open!

This set comes with a collapsible beach bucket, a watering can, a water wheel, a mesh bag, a rake, a shovel, and six animal sand molds. Promising review: ""My toddler and baby LOVED these beach toys. Super durable and easy to use. I love that the bucket is compacted for travel or packing in a suitcase. The bag is a bonus and is perfect for carrying everything together so nothing gets lost! Super easy to clean, the sand comes right off."" —skron Get it from Amazon for $22.99. Promising review: ""Ok. I never leave reviews but I HAD TO on this!!! BUY! BUY! BUY! We have six kids ranging from 2 months to 13 and our annual beach trip was coming up this past June. I wanted a beach tote that sand wouldn't collect in. I saw this and thought I would try it. I figured it wouldn't be as big as I needed. Fast forward to the day it came in...OMG it is was HUGE in person. Guys, I fit four sand buckets, four sets of beach toys, four small boogie boards in this thing and still had a TON of room to fit more! My only regret was that I didn't buy more than one! This would also be great for laundry, or anything!!!!!""—Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $8.99. The bikini top is UPF 50, fade-resistant, chlorine-safe, and sunscreen and oil resistant. They recommend hand-washing the garment. Wild Isles is a woman-owned small business based in Minneapolis that creates swimsuits constructed with sustainably, ethically made materials. Promising review: ""Honestly, I have never had a top that fit this well and allowed me to feel covered to move around, like playing volleyball or being crushed by waves without the girls falling out. SO happy I found this site."" —Jeannine R. Get the bikini top from Wild Isles for $95 (available in women's sizes 1-4, 3+, and 4+, which accommodates cup sizes D-H, and 10 colors & patterns). Check out the Wild Isles' bikini bottoms here. Promising review: ""Bought for a beach day incase anyone got overheated. It worked so well! My group also found out it's nice for a sunburn when you're trying to fall asleep. 😂 It stays nice and cold for hours! I also use mine when I have to mow the yard and it's way too hot out!"" —MeganSM Get it from Amazon for $14.97. To make it even cooler, dip it in water, and then place it in your beach cooler for a few minutes before putting it on your dog! Promising review: ""Took my pup to the beach and was worried she would overheat! This product did wonders! Stays cool longer than my other one!"" —McKenna Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in four sizes). This product is formulated without parabens, phthalates, petrolatum or SLS. Promising review: ""Whenever someone I know has a sunburn, I become that super annoying product-pusher friend. I tell everyone about the sun soother! Really, Burt’s Bees should pay me. It rubs into skin like lotion so you don’t feel greasy and can immediately put on clothes after application. A little goes a long way! It smells good without being overpowering (and I’m picky about scents!). Most importantly, it works! I’ve had everything from slight burn to looks-like-a-lobster-feels-like-fire and this sun soother has eliminated the pain/itch and drastically reduced the eventual peel. Highly recommend!"" —Jessie Patterson Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (also available in a three-pack). Hanalei is a small business based in Hawaii that specializes in beauty products and skincare blended with native Hawaiian botanicals. They donate a portion of their proceeds to the AKAMAI Foundation, a non-profit organization committed to providing students in Hawaii with skills and tools to prepare them for today’s highly competitive job market. Promising review: ""This product is great for many reasons: you get your money's worth and it makes your skin feel silky all year round when you apply it. When I get sunburns and I apply other aloe gels, it always peels and rubs and ends up being flakey on my skin and just irritates me in general. This is the ONLY aloe vera gel that I can find that does not do this and trust me I have tried EVERYTHING! I definitely recommend this product to all skin types and ages!"" —Lola Get it from Hanalei or from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in two sizes). This set includes the net, a carrying case, and three balls. Slammo is similar to volleyball: you and your partner have three hits to bounce or spike the ball into the net on the ground. Once the ball bounces up, it's the next team's turn. Whoever lets the ball hit the ground loses that round. It's designed for four players (two vs. two) and is recommended for players 12 years and older. Promising review: ""This is a well-built game that uses high-quality plastic to hold it in shape. There is a groove along the bottom that prevents the feet from twisting and falling over. The three balls included are also of high quality. Overall, I am extremely impressed with the entire set. Everything feels of the highest quality."" —TheProfessor101 Get it from Amazon for $34.99. This comes with two folding cornhole boards, eight beanbags, a carrying case, and a set of rules. Promising review: ""Got this for a little beach fun. It went over well. It's lightweight and easily transported. It takes up little space in the trunk. Sets up quickly and tears down just as quickly. Good buy for the price. Seems sturdy and looks like it will last with a little effort and care."" —Dennis Get it from Amazon for $38.59+ (available in four designs). Promising review: ""Every busy family needs this. We use it to carry our sports equipment, beach gear, and even our two young kids (1- and 3-years-old). The wheels are very sturdy. We've used it over grass and gravel, and it rolls without issue. The handle also extends out and it locks securely in place when not used. The whole cart also folds and unfolds easily and isn't too heavy when loading in and out of the car. I've seen this in stores, but it was a much better price here. Definitely recommend."" —Jheneya Get it from Amazon for $94.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""This is probably one of the best investments I have made regarding beach-going. I do not know how I was going about my beach days without having one of these brushes. Great product, strong bristles but soft enough for your skin/feet. I would recommend that anyone that goes to the beach, this should be a must-have just like an umbrella and chair."" —VCTrojanDodger Get it from Amazon for $22.95. See it in action on TikTok here.  Shakalo is a San Diego-based small business started to figure out a way to help people, especially parents remove sand before leaving the beach. The soft fabric pouch allows the powder to remove the sand without scattering everywhere. Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1x–2x a week. I even use it on my dogs paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of. I will definitely be buying the refill and another bag to have exclusively in the car."" —Gabbs Uresti Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (also available in a three-pack). It fits any phone up to 100 mm x 170 mm (or about 3.9 inches x 6.7 inches). It's also a great fix for keeping out sand and dirt (and a great option for runners, if you're caught in the rain but still want to be able to toggle through your music options).  Promising review: ""I purchased this item for a trip I took to Jamaica with my niece. One of our excursions was climbing a waterfall and they had instructed us to bring a waterproof case. My niece ended up using this one and while we were snorkeling, she took it off of her neck to take video and pics and then ended up dropping it. It was at the bottom of the sea for a good 10 minutes. She had to take her life vest and snorkel gear off to get deep enough to get it and we considered it to be a loss for her phone since it submerged for so long. We got back on the boat and took her phone out and it was dry as a bone!! We couldn't believe it. We went and did the excursion which included us being in constant water and submerged in some places and her phone was fine afterwards! I wasn't expecting it to work as well as it did! I told her then and there I was writing a review when we got back because it saved her phone! Just make sure to keep the strap around your neck so you don't accidentally lose it at the bottom of the sea like she did!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 14 colors). Former BuzzFeed editor Ciera Velarde has this and says, ""I bought this to take on a summer trip to Disney World and let me tell you — it's the only way I survived!! Every day got well into the 90s, but I kept this pointed at my face whenever I wasn't soaking up air conditioning. I was seriously impressed with how powerful it was and how I instantly felt less sweaty. The charge lasts about a day if you use it sparingly (or a few hours of continuous use), so make sure to charge it nightly if you're on a trip. The fan has three-speed settings, and it folds so you can prop it up on a table."" Promising review: ""This personal fan is ‘fan-tastic’! I purchased one for myself and loved it so much that I have purchased half a dozen more for special people in my life. Everyone that I gave one to absolutely loves them. We have used them at Disney, on the beach, at the park, great packable size for backpacks or diaper bags. Used on vacation on the bedside table at the hotel. We love love love this fan. Highly recommend you get one for each family member and friend! 10 out of 10!"" —R. Landry Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in six colors). The wide brim provides much more UV protection than regular caps! Promising review: ""I have long hair and always avoided hats because I hate having my hair sweating against my neck in a low bun or ponytail. With this sun visor-summer hat combo, I can keep my hair in a top knot and still keep my face and neck protected from the sun while catching a nice breeze. This is perfect (although a little large in circumference and I have a big head 7 3/4 hat size) and it’s adjustable and can fit any head size. It rolls up well and has an elastic to keep it rolled. I’ll be recommending this item to all my friends!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in 13 colors). See it in action on TikTok! This version of the Kindle is incredibly versatile: You can see your screen even in the sun, and you can customize your fonts, size, and layouts. Promising reviews: ""I am in love this with this Kindle. I debated which one to get for a while and then decided on this one because it is waterproof and can be read in the sun. I love being at the beach and outside during the summer so it was a must-have for me. So far I have read more and had access to so many more titles than having a hard-copy book. The lighting is just bright enough so that it doesn't hurt my eyes and is great for reading at night. The battery life has been great. For anyone contemplating getting this, it is worth it."" —jennifer ""I LOVE Kindles, and this one is no exception. The warm light is in the pictures as yellow, but it also goes the other way to an ice blue! And the touch response is miles better than the older Kindle; a tap is almost instantly registered. If you are on the fence, just try it! You have my permission and recommendation!"" —ErikJuun Get it from Amazon for $149.99+ (available in three colors and with or without lockscreen ads). Extra bonus, the whole thing is dishwasher safe! Check out a TikTok of the snack spinner in action. Promising review: ""I bought these before they were on Amazon. I’m obsessed. My kids think it’s a game, and they’re so intent on eating all the food inside. Even my picky eater. As a mom who absolutely hates to hand wash things, I’m so grateful that a) the entire thing comes apart for washing and b) it’s completely dishwasher-safe. This thing is awesome. One of a kind. I own five right now. Will probably be getting more in the future for when the baby is old enough to snack independently."" —Jordan Christman Get it from Amazon for $29.90+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""I wish I would've discovered this years ago. Going to the beach, having a clean water bowl for my dog has always been a challenge. This thing stays cold in the cooler and sand free. My boy loves drinking out of this and I highly recommend it if you've got a dog. Very compact and only takes up as much space as a taller bottle of water in your cooler. If they don't drink everything you've triggered it to dispense, just press the button and the water simply trickles back into the bottle. I love this thing!!"" —Cindy T. Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in two sizes and four colors).  Promising review: ""Love this! I am a flight attendant and keep it in my suitcase for various uses, but it's an outstanding beach or picnic blanket. It weighs nothing, is beautiful, and of great quality! My new go-to gift item."" —Laurance F. Haun Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in 26 patterns).  These have the American Podiatric Medical Association Seal of Acceptance, which is granted to products found to promote good foot health!

I really am happy with these flip-flops!"" —INcatlady Get them from Amazon for $29.59+ (available in women's sizes 6–11 and 18 colors).  Check it out on TikTok.  It comes with three head attachments: a flathead hose, an extension tube, and a brush head. Promising review: ""I have a brand new car that I am trying to keep nice. But living in Hawaii, especially beachfront, every time I get in my car or other people do there is always sand on my floor mats. I didn't want to go through the hassle and removing and cleaning my mats when I knew that the very next time there would be sand already. So I decided to give this vacuum a try. And boy am I happy!! It sucked all the sand up no problem!! I'm very pleased and tickled with it!"" —Love Get it from Amazon for $37.99+ (available in black or white and two versions).  The reviews used in this post have been edited for length and clarity. "
67,Angelica Cheyenne,10 Celebs Speak On Their Crazy Expensive Divorces,https://www.buzzfeed.com/angelicacheyenne/celebs-who-went-through-expensive-divorces,"Love might not cost a thing, but divorce does.View Entire Post ›",2024-06-08T03:16:02Z,"Love might not cost a thing, but divorce does. BuzzFeed Contributor Jolie and Pitt were practically the ""It"" couple of the 2000s. Their romance was of peak interest to many since their relationship began before Pitt officially divorced his first wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, in 2005. From the inception of their relationship, which began in 2004, the couple was known as ""Brangelina,"" often referred to as such until the two A-list actors split.  So far, their divorce process has cost Jolie and Pitt $14 million. The Girl, Interrupted star, notably, has been very transparent about how their separation affected her. Jolie revealed that she felt ""smaller, almost insignificant, even if it wasn’t necessarily obvious,"" when she and Pitt called it quits. “I felt a deep and genuine sadness, I was hurt."" Pitt admitted to GQ in 2017 that he wanted Jolie, his multiple children, and him to become ""better people"" when the divorce was finalized.  ""So our focus is that everyone comes out stronger and better people — there is no other outcome,"" Pitt told the news outlet.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West captivated the world when they became romantically linked in 2012 after four years of friendship. Two years later, the reality personality and mega hip-hop star got married, documenting their extravagant wedding on an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians in 2014.  The celebs had to figure out and split up their $2 billion combined worth. Though it was expensive, Kardashian was willing to pay up to end her marriage to West officially. ""I very much desire to be divorced. I have asked Kanye to keep our divorce private, but he has not done so,"" Kim told People. ""Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private family matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress."" West now has to pay $200K in child support for the divorced couple's four kids: North, Chicago, Saint, and Psalm.    Martin and Paltrow walked down the aisle in 2003 after one year of dating. The Coldplay frontman and Hollywood actress were married for over a decade before they filed for divorce in 2015. That year, Martin and Paltrow were ""set for a $280 million divorce,"" the Mirror reported.  In 2020, the Shakespeare in Love star revealed in an essay she wrote for British Vogue when she knew her and Martin's relationship was done. “I don’t remember which day of the weekend it was or the time of day,” Paltrow wrote, referencing a getaway she and Martin took to Italy in 2010. ”But I knew — despite long walks and longer lie-ins, big glasses of Barolo, and hands held — my marriage was over.” Former president Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump, are among the most famous couples ever. They reportedly met in New York City in 1976 when Ivana Trump, who was then known as Ivana Zelníčková, was there for a fashion show, the Independent explained.  Trump's affair with his well-known sidekick, Marla Maples, led to his divorce from Ivana in the early '90s. Under the divorce settlement, Ivana received $14 million plus a few properties and $680K in support for their children, Ivanka, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump.  Ivana probably could've gotten more had she not signed a prenuptial agreement that put a $25-million cap on how much she could receive in a divorce settlement.  Frasier star Grammer married his third wife Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum Meyer in 1997. After 14 years, they divorced in 2011. Their separation captured the media, especially since their relationship was documented on RHOBH.  “Thank God I didn’t have a prenup. Thank you Kelsey. I guess you loved me at one point,"" the TV personality said in a segment during the Season 2 finale of Then and Now with Andy Cohen. In addition to $30 million, Grammer's third ex-wife received a combined $41K for spousal and child support for their children Mason and Jude Grammer. The Microsoft cofounder and French crossed paths when she started working as a product manager at the company in 1987. A few years later, the pair were engaged in 1993, marrying in Hawaii in 1994. Despite all Gates and French accomplished during their relationship, like launching the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and donating a lot of their fortune to philanthropic efforts, they still decided to divorce in 2021.  In 2022, French opened up about her divorce from Gates in an interview with Fortune.""I had some reasons I just couldn't stay in that marriage anymore,"" French said in the interview. ""But the odd thing about COVID is that it gave me the privacy to do what I needed to do.""She continued, ""It's unbelievably painful, in innumerable ways, but I had the privacy to get through it."" Douglas and Luker had a whirlwind romance, marrying in 1977 after only eight weeks of dating. A year later, they welcomed their son Cameron Douglas in 1978. They remained married for 22 years before they split in 2000.  ""I know I'm going to get into trouble here. I have nothing against her and in fact I'm very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier,"" Douglas told the news publication.He added: ""It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems, it's in his interest to keep the marriage going. Because if I end the marriage he's got no business. I think Diandra would probably say the same thing. That's the only clear regret that I have."" Jenner (née Houghton) married Caitlyn in 1991 before she transitioned into womanhood. Their union spawned Kris's youngest two children, Kendall and Kylie Jenner. Kris and Caitlyn stayed together for years until Kris filed for divorce in 2014.  When they divorced, Kris paid Caitlyn $2.5 million. Additionally, they split all of their assets and acquired wealth as a couple. Their joint worth was estimated to be $60 million when they called it quits.   ""After 23 years, Kris and I went our separate directions,"" the I am Cait star explained on an episode of the Literally! With Rob Lowe podcast. ""My identity…it was not a big part of us separating. There was so many other bigger issues out there.""   Diamond and Murphey divorced in 1994, following 25 years of marriage. When they broke up, the Grammy-winning singer gave up a reported $150 million to Murphey.  ""I'm worth every penny,"" Murphey said regarding her divorce settlement.    Former Los Angeles Lakers star O'Neal got together with Basketball Wives executive producer Henderson in 1996. At the time, Henderson was a film marketer, and O'Neal was a new player on the West Coast team.  ""The marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken,"" part of the petition that O'Neal's lawyer Ira Elegant filed that year read. However, O'Neal and Henderson reconciled, and they called off their divorce in 2008. Their reconciliation lasted a limited time because, in 2009, Henderson filed for divorce.  Shaunie reportedly received $10K per month in alimony and $100K in child support for their children upon their divorce. ""You don't know how good you got something till it's gone,"" he told the news outlet. ""I mentioned about having a 76,000-square-foot house and nobody in there. That was all my fault."" ""I didn't do the right thing,"" he continued, ""and I definitely paid for it."""

BuzzFeed Staff NOTE: There are mentions of sexual abuse and murder. —u/ToomintheEllimist ""I only recently found out about it, as I had a box of my mother's from before she died. I knew what was in it were scrapbooks, mementos, and things she wrote down that she wanted me to know or have. She's been gone almost 11ish years now, and I will admit I've never gone through it thoroughly. It hurt too much to see so many things that she saved or all the pictures of now-gone relatives. I finally went through it after talking to my fiancé recently about one Halloween when my brother, uncle, and I went out dressed as Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia. I couldn't find pictures of us in any of the albums I had, so I went through the box looking for them. I did find them, but I also found a letter from my mom in an envelope addressed to me with the date of my grandfather's death under it. It turns out that my grandfather poisoned my grandmother after she confessed to abusing my mother for nearly all of her childhood during a fight they were having. He used some old rodent poison he'd had in the basement from the '50s and slipped it in her tea. She eventually became ill and showed signs of dementia; she was put into specialized care, where they diagnosed her at that time with environmentally caused ALS. She passed shortly after going into care. He confessed to my mom and her younger brother when it was suggested by the care facility that he get his pipes, groundwater, and soil tested. He acted agitated, which my mom picked up on and pressed him about later. My uncle took the poison to a business he dealt with through his job that did toxic material disposal and would often take people's walk-ins of things like this. He also got rid of the teacup and the spoon that my grandfather used to serve her every day. What's funny is that I inherited the teacup set, and it is indeed a cup short, and the silverware set is a spoon short. My mom expressed a lot of guilt over it. She felt horrified that her father, in her eyes, killed for her, and she also felt a lot of guilt for not feeling sadness for her mother. I'm not sure how I feel about it at all. Everyone involved is long dead, so there is no justice to seek, and I only remember my grandmother in vague terms, as rough, mean, and scary. Whereas my grandfather was a stern but loving man who taught me many things and loved his kids and grandkids. I ended up burning the letter just because I felt like my mom would've wanted that."" —u/skinflakesasconfetti —u/send_me_jokes_plz —u/Evening-Dizzy —u/IHadAnOpinion —u/artsycraftsy626 —u/-TheRealFolkBlues- ""Just after he died, my aunt divorced my uncle. At age 12, I overheard my other uncles (two were my mom's brothers, and one married my mom's baby sister) talking about a vow they had made to keep me from being a victim of Grandpa. At 16, I figured it out. The uncle who had murdered him was a jeweler and insulin-dependent diabetic. He used cyanide in jewelry making. Grandpa drank a 36-pack of beer every night. I suspected he injected cyanide into a random beer. My aunt saw Grandpa alive at 2 a.m. My uncle woke up at 5 a.m., and grandpa was dead and stiff. His body was cremated, and my uncle vanished. I mentioned my suspicions to my cousin, who relayed them to his father. Three years ago, my uncle was dying. He reached out to me and told me I had correctly figured out how grandpa died.

With him unemployed, he couldn't afford to pay child support, leaving only my mom's income, which was barely enough to support us. Basically, if she hadn't been so vindictive, we wouldn't have wound up in such dire financial straits. It's pretty telling that my dad never spoke ill of her; he just said that he was blindsided and confused by her choices and jealous of her current partner. On the other hand, my mom only ever said negative things about him, and when she was angry with me, she would compare me to him.

I'm carrying it with me everywhere!"" —Rebecca Get it from Amazon for $9.95 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""I wasn't sure what to expect when purchasing these, but now they are a staple in every room of our house.

Promising review: ""I've been searching for something to remove the weeds for a while and came across this amazing tool. Since I refuse to use chemicals in my yard, I've been left with scraped knuckles every time I attempt to remove weeds. The weeds have grown so tightly in the concrete cracks that I pretty much gave up; even weed-whacking it didn't help much. Yes, you do have to use a little bit of effort, but the end result was so worth it!"" —Shelley Arakaki Get it from Amazon for $22.95. Promising review: ""I got these to make ice cubes that I could fit into hot water bottles to make 'cold water bottles.' I'm in the big heat wave, and it's been over 100 every day for the last week, with no sign of it letting up any time soon. These are quick and easy and the cold water bottles have been the only thing helping me sleep in a room anywhere between 80–90 degrees at night. I love the lids! It makes my ice trays easy to stack and more secure. I wish all ice trays came with lids like this!"" —A.J. Stark  Get a set of three from Amazon for $12.99+ (available with or without covers).  Promising review: ""A lifesaver! The compact design makes it easy to carry in your bag or pocket. The fan's performance is impressive; it generates a strong breeze for its size, instantly cooling me down on hot days. The noise level is pleasantly low, perfect for use in quiet environments. The battery life is impressive, lasting through extended outings. It's a must-have for anyone looking to stay cool and refreshed during summer or while traveling. We are thrilled with this handy little fan!"" —Allie Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""This stuff is AMAZING! Literally nothing else keeps tangles out of my daughter’s hair like this does. Her hair is so thick and very difficult to brush; this makes it easy peasy to brush the tangles out after a swim in the pool. It also softens her hair. When not used, the pool chemicals make her hair very stiff and dry. We even use this every once in a while just because! It smells wonderful and doesn’t make the hair greasy in any way. I cannot recommend this product enough!!!"" —Emily Get it from Amazon for $21.99. Psst — it's also gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free!  BuzzFeed writer Elizabeth Lilly swears by these: ""I always ALWAYS pack this stuff for trips. I recently visited Vegas for ~48 hours for an outdoor music festival. I drank one in the morning before boarding my flight, then once I got checked into my hotel, then the next morning before the music festival where I was outside and guzzling tall boys of beer. And I felt great when I woke up the next day! Drinking Liquid IV also meant I didn't have to guzzle plain water (and then stand in line for the bathroom a ton) to stay hydrated for the 12+-hour festival.""  Promising review: ""I’m a tile setter in South Texas, and Liquid IV has made a significant difference in my ability to stay hydrated in these 100+ degree summer days."" —Colton F.

Shakalo is a small business based in San Diego. Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1–2 times a week. I even use it on my dog's paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of, too. I will definitely be buying the refill and another baggie to have exclusively in the car."" —Gabbs Uresti Get it from Shakalo on Amazon for $24.99. Promising review: ""Love that these come with a clip. Makes it so handy to travel with and not lose any of the cards. Great for kids, too, because they always seem to break the box when they have to put them back in the box. Of course, the waterproof aspect is wonderful!"" —Peachy Keenes Get it from Amazon for $14.24. Promising review: ""Our hot tub was so much grosser than I could have imagined. The amount of ick that this stuff got out of the jets was surprising. Honestly so embarrassing. I drained and cleaned the tub a few months ago but did not think of getting this jet cleaner. I will not make that mistake again. The hot tub smells so so clean now. I will definitely use this again next time I drain the tub."" —Kaerlia Get it from Amazon for $18.36. Promising review: ""I installed this in February, and it had paid for itself by August by allowing me to turn off watering via the phone app from the comfort of where ever I was. The savings have accelerated this fall, and I expect by next February, I could buy another with the savings. Spring and summer were pretty dry, and the smart features really didn't come into play much. This fall has been pretty wet, and the Rachio has been good about both not watering if rain is coming and skipping if the 'ground is saturated.'"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $99+ (available in three styles).

I burn when [the sun is] intense, but I get a great tan otherwise. My 9-month-old is fair, fair, fair. Blue eyes and porcelain skin fair. I reapply my own SPF 50 after a few hours, but I'm not consistent. I've never been great about sunscreen, but I was not going to let my daughter get burned. We live in South Florida, and just walking or park time is a potential burning hazard. This is a great visual for me to reapply her sunscreen or make sure she gets in the shade. They're an absolute essential for parents, especially the 'sun goddess' type."" —FlightLife Get 16 stickers from Amazon for $15.99 (also available in packs of 32 and 48).

Promising review: ""Love that I don't have to dig one out from behind a seat or something. You just grab the tab and pull it over to connect to the cup on the driver's side. Reduces the amount of heat in my car. The steering wheel and surfaces are cool to the touch after a 90- to 100-degree day. Caution: When disconnecting, hang on to the tab and slowly put it back into the closed position. Otherwise, you will mess up the accordion folds."" —millie snow Get it from Amazon for $23.89+ (available in two colors/sizes).   Promising review: ""What an amazing product! I needed this to go to the beach on a hot day (almost 100 degrees) for some shade. It is easy to put it up. On that hot day, it kept us from burning under the sun for four hours; we opened the windows for ventilation, and it worked fine."" —Georgina Get it from Amazon for $33.99+ (available in three sizes and five colors). Promising review: ""Keeps the bugs out! Baby loved having the space to roam and enjoy the sunshine. Very easy to set up — literally just pops open! Comes with stakes to secure into the ground or sand. Also comes with a top attachment for extra shade. I was worried it might get muggy inside the tent, but there was great ventilation, and the baby stayed cool as a cucumber. This thing is going to be great for the beach and all the sunny days ahead. I was tempted to buy two: one for home and another for travel. Highly recommend."" —Sam Get it from Amazon for $139.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I have a room that is extremely hot in the spring and summer. With this product (and the task of temporarily closing vents in other rooms), I am able to bring the temp down 6 degrees in that hot room in just one hour without affecting the temp anywhere else! Awesome!!"" —Denise Davis Get it from Amazon for $59.99 (available in white or bronze). Promising review: ""I bought this because I was looking for an effective insect repellant for my patio this spring/summer. I didn't want a bulky candle or tiki torch that smelled like canola oil. I found the Thermacell. It looked modern and promising. We tried it, and it works really well. It also produces no smell or sound. We live in the south, where mosquitos are really awful, and the Thermacell made sitting on our patio tolerable! Definitely recommend."" —Trusted Customer Get it from Amazon for $20.97+ (available in eight colors and packs of two). SunShader is a small biz!

Using this product was so fast and easy they didn't even complain!!"" —Jeshleigh Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in six colors and packs of two). Promising review: ""I just tried these last weekend at an outdoor wedding with an indoor reception. They were amazing! I kept them on all night. First, I walked outside in thick grass, and the wedding photos were taken in a mushy grassy area. I didn't sink even a little bit. It was fantastic. My heels were fabulous. I then decided to leave them on for the rest of the night since they made my heels more stable and comfortable. So glad I tried them.

The minute I used this product, I ran to write a review. My entire life, I have had perfect skin. I didn’t use any products, masks, moisturizer, nothing. It was a blessing. I had a baby and ever since, my skin has been horrible, especially my nose. Pores so filled even estheticians couldn’t help me. One use of this scrubber and I see a NOTICEABLE difference. It’s honestly incredible. I’m finally feeling like myself again. HIGHLY recommend!"" —Cristian Get it from Amazon for $12.50.  Promising review: ""GAME CHANGER! I have both cats and dogs at home. One of my dogs loves to sleep in the bed, under the blankets. She has pretty fine fur and tends to shed a good bit so there always seems to be dog hair in my bed where she has laid. I had seen this in a few BuzzFeed articles and on TikTok but I was pretty hesitant to buy it because of the price and being skeptical that it worked. I am SHOCKED by how amazing this thing is! IT PICKS UP SO MUCH PET HAIR!! It’s super easy to use and clean which is also a plus. I use this on my bed where my dog sleeps and it does such a great job at picking up her hair that you can’t even tell that she’s laid in the bed all day! I can’t say anything negative about this. I plan to buy a couple more to keep in different rooms where my pets like to be on furniture! If you have pets, then you NEED a ChomChom!!"" —Melissa Eggleton Get it from Amazon for $31.95. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Natalie Brown has tried these and raves: ""I've worn them four or five times now, washing with hand soap and water afterward every time as directed, and they're exactly what I needed! It's simple: you stick 'em onto clean, dry, lotion-free skin, and they stay put and comfy for hours, even through moderate sweat. They've performed perfectly every time I've worn them: for day-long shopping excursions, outdoor parties, and for nights out dancing. They come in a small reusable storage box with two stiff plastic domes for them to sit on, so they'll stay perfectly intact and dust-free in your drawer and are easy to pack for travel.

I don’t think I’ve ever seen value like I do this product! Literally use it on EVERYTHING! Kids and teens have dirt, grime, and, grease on their walls? This will make it look like a new paint job. Baseboards need some love? A pea-size amount of this makes them look brand new. Need a shoe cleaner? PERFECT for sneakers. I could name a million more uses, but I can ASSURE you this is worth every penny. What’s more? You need such LITTLE of this product, it will last a VERY long time.

Because AirPods and other tech can be difficult to clean, a putty cleaner like this effectively gets the job done without needing to use any harsh cleaners or oversized cloths. See it in action on TikTok here.  Promising review: ""I use my AirPods every single day to listen to music at work. I only use one AirPod just in case my boss needs my attention. I had noticed that I could barely hear anything through my AirPod, even though I had the volume all the way up. I saw this putty in a BuzzFeed article and so decided to order and test it. I’m writing this about two minutes after using it and I am amazed with how well it works! It got all the gunk out and the sound is amazing, I don’t need to have the volume up very much to be able to hear everything anymore. If you have literally any doubts about this product, forget them. This stuff works great and is a great price for the amount you get. You get 12 squares of putty; I used a whole one to clean my AirPod, though I suspect you could clean both AirPods with just one square."" —Katelyn Get a 24-pack from Amazon for $15.99 (also available in a 12-pack).

I have an awkward shaped ear canal and struggle to find earbuds that I like and that are comfy, and I LOVE my AirPods but they don’t fit snug enough for me to work out in them (one actually flew off on the treadmill and I stopped wearing them to the gym since then) but these hooks are AMAZING. They are so comfortable you don’t even notice they’re there and it provides the perfect amount of security for running/jumping around. So happy I tried these out.

Seriously, my favorite styling tool. Seriously, so in love."" —Sydney Get it from Amazon for $38.98+ (available in four styles). Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. I saw it on TikTok and figured I would give it a try. My grandmother passed away almost eight years ago, and she left me her first engagement ring in her will. I have tried so many jewelry cleaners, toothpaste and toothbrush, you name it, tried everything except for sending it away to get cleaned. I ordered the Diamond Dazzle Stik on Thursday and it arrived the following Saturday, fast shipping! Today is Sunday and I cleaned my ring with the Diamond Dazzle Stik. My ring is just as shiny as it was when my grandfather bought it for my grandmother many many years ago. I will definitely use this Diamond Dazzle Stik on all my jewelry.

So many ways to try using the mat."" —Arlington Ink Get it from Amazon for $23.86+ (available in two sizes and nine colors). Promising reviews: ""Don't hesitate, just buy these. I was using the Real Technique sponges for years and I bought these on a whim after seeing several TikToks praising these.

I wash mine between each use and these hold up very well and much longer than the RT. Very happy with my purchase and the price. Will definitely continue to buy."" —chris ""I love these makeup sponges. I am new to makeup and still learning, and these sponges are great for blending.

Promising review: ""I saw this product on a 'TikTok amazing finds.' And given that my purse always seems to tip over in the back seat, emptying all the contents all over the floor, I thought I would give it a try.

I like that the numbers are very easy to read and it gives you the option if you want to use the 12-hour feature or the 24-hour feature. I also like that it has ports on the side so that I can charge up my phone etc. You can also control the brightness on it. I'm a type of person that likes to sleep in a room that's pitch black usually, but with the brightness feature, I can find a setting that's not going to interfere with my sleep or agitate me in the night. —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.59 (available in five colors).

Sheets balling all up in the washer and dryer has been a pet peeve of mine for forever. I was super skeptical of these, but I tried it, and it works as advertised!

We have a Bissell vacuum/mop and it does really great, especially on our laminate floors. But it's more of a superficial clean for carpets and that's good BUT if you have pets...our area rugs need a good scrub, especially on our office carpet which is full of coffee spills. Our rug was brown!!! I forgot it was blue/grey. Wow. Just wow. A bit of elbow grease this clean since it was pretty bad, but look at the difference!! I tried every spot cleaner out there....those little cleaners that come with a scrub head, even just a brush and bucket. Nothing touched it, you need the suction to get it all out. This little guy is amazing. I'm sure it'll work great on our couch and other area rugs. If you're in doubt....well the pictures speak for themselves!!"" —SB ""The dog that I raised as my child decided to vomit whatever snack he ate last night. Also it sat in this rug for about 9 hours. Needless to say I was annoyed. Haven’t used this baby too often but I’ve borrowed it to people. But it works great!!

Get it from Amazon for $8.80 (available in two formulas) or Cocokind for $9. Cocokind is a small business based in San Francisco creating vegan and botanical-based skincare products. See a TikTok of the Buddeez sandwich bread dispenser in action.  Promising review: ""The Buddeez Sandwich Bread Dispenser is great! It does exactly what it was intended for. I live alone and I don't quite go through bread often enough before the last quarter section of the loaf starts to go stale. I was originally looking for something to put a loaf of bread in as a shell for my vacuum sealer, that would keep the bread from getting crushed from the pressure. This dispenser solved all of my problems. Thank you!"" —DRMcQuaig Get it from Amazon for $14.97 (available in five sizes). Promising review: ""My boyfriend can’t cut bagels. He literally butchers these poor baby bagels all up. I saw this on a TikTok and I was like oh we need that. So I bought it. And it was a good investment. Now we can enjoy nicely sliced bagels that fit in a toaster and aren’t jagged across. Yay bagel slicer!"" —Ci DiPalma Get it from Amazon for $29.98 (available in four colors). Check it out on TikTok here.  Promising review: ""I bought this because of a TikTok video. Super cool and now nobody has to ask me if the dishes are clean or not."" —D.

Maker. 🙌 BuzzFeed Staff Check out a TikTok of the rapid cold brew maker in action.  Promising review: ""I like cold brew year round and this may be my favorite method/machine yet! It’s so easy to assemble, use, and clean. In about 15 minutes I was impressed with how rich and bold the brew was, with no grounds like others I’ve tried.  It looks great on my kitchen counter. It’s lightweight and stable with the base suction cups. It makes a little noise but much less than I expected (and less than my Nespresso machine)."" —Liz Get it from Amazon for $105.   Promising review: ""I bought this because my daughter told me she has had one for four years, and it still works great. They enjoy wine and use it. It is so comfortable to use; I have shoulder problems, so that is important. I've used it for about a month now, which is longer than the $$$ one from Williams Sonoma, which died an ugly death. And it doesn't twist forcibly and hurt my shoulder like others I've had. So I am very impressed. The accompanying foil cutter is the best I've ever had, by the way!"" —Midge Get it from Amazon for $32.31. Each cleaner comes with a trial size of Bissell's Spot & Stain Formula, which is also available on Amazon for $12.99!  Promising review: ""I wish I had taken photos since I was amazed at the results, honestly. I bought my car about a year ago and it had stains all over the seats — I didn’t want to pay $300+ for them to be cleaned since I’m a college student so I just waited. My sister saw a TikTok video or something about this machine and while I was doubtful that it would work since some of these stains have been there for who knows how long I finally bought it cause I spilt a blue slushee over my car seats. Lo and behold I now have a car with no stains whatsoever! I wish I had gotten it sooner!! I wish I would’ve taken before and after pics but I’ll try and upload some of how it looks now at some point! But 15/10 recommend!!"" —jovana montoya Get it from Amazon for $98.59.    EyeVac is a small business that specializes in vacuums for home and commercial use.  Promising review: ""Saw it on TikTok and knew I had to have one. I hate cleaning but get annoyed with the clumps of dog hair and bits of things on my kitchen floor. I usually just vacuum my tile with the vacuum which is a pain. This thing is so easy to just sweet things into and it sucks them right up. Sure, it's more expensive than my actual vacuum, but I've only had it three days and have used it two times."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $149.99 (available in six colors). Check out a TikTok of the Noorio camera in action.  Promising review: ""One of the best purchases I have made, super convenient to use and install, great pictures and recordings. Has a SD card already installed so no need to spend extra money. The customer support is outstanding, easy to reach and very helpful. One thing to note is that to capture all recordings, you need to enable both motion and person detections. I had it set on only person to limit notifications but it missed a few recordings of me going in and out of the house for some reason. I haven’t had any trouble getting a recording now after enabling both. Best of all, there are no hidden and monthly fees, don’t have anybody hassling or forcing you to subscribe in order to view more recordings. I will buy another."" —David Get it from Amazon for $69.99+ (available in three styles).  Promising review: ""These had great reviews, but I was still a bit skeptical. I'm a bit of a pillow snob. These pillows — these amazing, heavenly pillows — are now my favorite part of going to bed. Soft but firm. How does that work? It gives support for me to sleep slightly propped up but I sink into this comfortable personal cloud. Soft but firm. My head isn't sinking through the pillow to rest on my mattress, but I feel comfortably enveloped. Heaven. I bought two but think that would be too much fluff, so now my husband and I each have one. Buy them. Add to cart. Buy now with one click. Stop the research. You've found the pillows you were looking for."" —Marissa Urey ""God himself must use these pillows. I have (or had haha) insomnia, not to mention a bad neck/back *and* hot flashes. The comfort and the cooling is AMAZING (even with silk pillowcase). Thank you TikTok for influencing me!!!!"" —Rickie White Get a set of two from Amazon for $35.99+ (clip the 40% off coupon on the product page for this price; available in two sizes).  Promising review: ""These sheets are the softest, lightest sheets I’ve ever slept under. I’ve never had any brand of linen sheets before. These sheets were delivered yesterday. I threw them in the washer and dryer and then made up the bed. They don’t look like they would be as soft and comfortable as they are, but they are so amazing I ordered another set today! So earthy and natural. I’ve shopped around, and these are very reasonable. Buy them. You will not regret it!"" —Catherine S.

Check out a TikTok of the Caraway set in action.  Each set includes a fry pan, sauce pan with lid, sauté pan with lid, Dutch oven with lid, modular pan rack, and three-slot canvas lid holder.  Promising review: ""I bought this set for my younger sister as she was using my mom’s old pans. I’ve had my set in Navy Blue for over a year and love them! Some stuff may stick a little in the pan while cooking, but it comes right off when you wash them. They are heavier than normal pots and pans, but you can get used to it after using them every day. A great set for people who cook every day!"" —CountryHolly Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $395+ (available in eight colors).  Promising review: ""My daughter was able to put this table together by herself within 45 minutes. I love that it’s real wood and is very sturdy. The fact that it lifts up so that you can have a table to work from is amazing. I would definitely recommend this, it works well with a large sectional."" —Marta Get it from Amazon for $98.99+ (available in five styles).  Brightech is a California-based small business that specializes in home lighting.  Promising review: ""The light is nice! It’s a unique looking light. I love how it has three different settings so you can adjust the brightness. It fits perfectly with my reading chaise and goes well with the rest of my living room decor. The only con I have is I wish the cord was clear instead of black, it sticks out. Other than that, I love the light. I’d definitely recommend it to others."" —Carmelita Joy Get it from Amazon for $79.99+ (available in four colors).  Check out a TikTok of the Cosori kettle in action.  Promising review: ""I have always kept my kettles on a base of some sort so having a kettle with its own base is wonderful. The base has various types of heating selections for teas and coffee which light up when on. I have had it for over a month now and use it every day. It works perfectly and I absolutely adore its elegant look. Perfect for my morning coffee."" —JAH Get it from Amazon for $59.98+ (available in four styles).  Promising review: ""Changed my life. I work from home and sit at my desk nine hours during the week and four on Saturdays. I had so much pain in my tail bone sometimes I could hardly stand after sitting all day. Since receiving cushion (which arrived on time and is as described), I have had about 90% pain relief. I was hesitant to order because of the price, but it is worth every penny. I take it on flights and road trips and am considering buying another one to leave in my vehicle."" —Poboie Get it from Amazon for $62+ (available in three colors).  This desk bike is also height adjustable so you can get your perfect fit with the tray, and has ""whisper quiet"" pedaling, eight resistance levels, and a way to track your mileage, RPM, and other stats.  Promising review: ""I saw this on TikTok and bought it. No regrets! I’ve used this almost daily since I got it. I’m moving way more than I did before. The tabletop part is a little loose but that might be from me leaning on it too much. It wasn’t originally like that. I haven’t looked into tightening it. This is 10 out of 10 recommended for someone who's looking to move more!!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $499.99 (available in three styles).  Psst — you can watch the viral desk bike TikTok featuring it for more insight on how it works. It's been liked over 1.8 million times! Promising review: ""We desperately needed a way to have more ice at our summer home, and this was the best purchase we’ve made to fix this! So easy to use and continually makes ice all day like we want it. We put the ice into the freezer as it continues to make it, so we never run out! So much better than constantly making trips to the gas station and spending money on bags of ice! So worth the purchase!"" —Jackie Get it from Amazon for $84.99+ (clip the $5 off coupon on the product page for this price; available in two colors). Check out a TikTok of the reading chair in action.  Promising review: ""Amazing reading chair/lounger. If you're one of those people who needs to change positions often while reading, this chair is the bomb. I leave a charging cord in the arm for my phone and headphones, slide out the foot, and grab whatever book I chucked under there. I can lay down, recline, sit straight, etc. with ease. The foot stool part, being collapsible and held up with thin bars, did kind of sink a little after awhile but nothing that makes the chair feel broken or look lopsided. It's a solid little guy and I plan on picking another one up eventually for another room I like to read in."" —Calvin Andrews Get it from Amazon for $254.99+ (available in four colors).  Each Click & Grow kit comes with three basil pods to start you off, and you can check out the full selection of grow pods for more options!  Promising review: ""The Click & Grow Smart Garden is very easy to set up and has fairly minimal upkeep. Place pods in, fill them up with water, and turn on the light. The lettuce has grown exceptionally well. My grandkids love to check it out when they come to visit. I am considering gifting Click and Grow Smart Gardens to them. It is straightforward and sets you up to be a successful gardener, no matter your experience level. I wanted to grow some herbs and vegetables in the winter. I love the Click & Grow!"" —Kbaumg Get it from Amazon for $80.73+ (available in three colors).  Check out a TikTok of the rain cloud diffuser in action. Promising review: ""I love this thing. I have anxiety and insomnia, and I need background noise to function/sleep. This little desktop fountain is SO SOOTHING, both aesthetically and the sound of the little raindrops. If I’m in the room with it, it’s probably on. If you love the sound of rain this is for you. Because I’m paranoid and I want this to last, I run it with plain distilled water and I have not used essential oils with it even though they say it’s fine. It’s very dry here right now, and I still only have to top up the water every few days, even with it running daily. It’s a solid 12/10 from me."" —Violet Get it from Amazon for $39.98.  Check out a TikTok of the retro Bluetooth speaker in action.  Promising review: ""Sound quality and durability is very good! I like the ability to change the artwork on the cover, the ability to change the brightness of the image, the ability to change the volume of the startup/connect/disconnect, the auto-shutoff and auto-sleep mode toggles, and the ability to set multiple alarms (available on the app only, sadly, not out of the box). There's surprisingly a lot you can do with such a seemingly simple device, and it's made more than a great replacement alarm clock for me, which is initially what I bought it for. Highly recommend if you've got the extra coin to spend on something cute, fun, and practical!"" —Soul Breaker Get it from Amazon for $81.99 (get this price by clipping the 20% off coupon on the product page; available in six colors).  Check out a TikTok of the multicooker in action.  Promising review: ""I normally don’t write reviews. However, if I could give this pressure cooker a 10 out of 5 stars, I would. So far I’ve cooked a whole chicken, beans and rice, working on baby rack ribs, and a few other things. The best feature is all dishes I’ve cooked have taken no more than one hour. I have yet to try vegetables, but parsnips are in the near future as are beats. Only criticism would be to invest in some kind of trivet to keep the meat you’re cooking out of the liquid. Planning on some lamb shanks in the very near future."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $250 (available in four colors).  Promising review: ""Saw it on TikTok and decided to try it. Paid a lil over $50 for it but honestly I would have paid $100 for it. It feels like my own personal theatre. The picture quality is amazinggggg!!!! I’ve connected it to my JBL speakers for the full experience. You don’t need it though because the speakers on it work great as well. I love it so much so far."" —Brogadess Get it from Amazon for $71.99 (clip the 20% off coupon on the product page for this price).  Check out a TikTok of the Balmuda toaster in action.  Promising review: ""Holy moly! Best toast I have ever made. I did a comparison taste test with the Balmuda toaster versus my cheapie $60 toaster oven. You can really taste the difference in the toast with the texture and the moisture of the inside of the toast. Hands down, Balmuda blew my other toaster out the water. So happy with purchase."" —JL Get it from Amazon for $239+ (available in six colors). Promising review: ""This rug is more beautiful than I expected. Good quality, gorgeous pattern and colors. I was looking for something to help blend both warm and cool tones and this rug did that beautifully."" —Misty Eversmann Get it from Amazon for $169.99+ (available in 13 styles and 23 sizes).  Check out a TikTok of the Bearaby blanket in action.  I've been using this weighted blanket for about three years now, and what I find really remarkable about it is that I *never* feel overheated in it. It's also just so, SO soft, and looks absolutely beautiful at the foot of my bed where I leave it every night. It definitely helps me activate ""sleep mode"" at night — I find the weight very comforting and not at all stifling because it spreads so evenly.  Promising review: ""I’m in love with this blanket! It is absolutely gorgeous and has made a remarkable difference in my sleeping habits. If you are even thinking about a weighted blanket, this is a MUST! Just do it! You will only wish you’d done it sooner!"" —Sandy  Psst — to choose a style, Bearaby recommends a blanket that is about ten percent of your body weight.  Get it from Bearaby for $199+ (available in four weights and six colors).  Honeydew is a small business that specializes in uniquely-designed sleep products.  Promising review: ""I have searched for a perfect pillow for many months, and finally found this one. I LOVE this pillow. It is soft yet supportive, and the shape is perfect for side sleeping. It is expensive, true, but I think well worth the price. The fill used is wonderful compared to shredded or molded memory foam. It feels like down but with more neck support, and not at all lumpy. I like to hug the side extensions which provide support for my upper body when sleeping on my side. I totally recommend this pillow for side sleepers. You won't be disappointed."" —Elizabeth Wright  Get it from Amazon for $149.99+ (available in Queen and King sizes).  Check out a TikTok of the touchless paper towel dispenser in action.  Bonus: if you don't grab the paper towel, it sucks it back up for safekeeping!  Promising review: ""Do we need it? No. But it might be my favorite unnecessary gadget purchase of all time. It leaves our counter tops uncluttered, the no touch sensor lets me grab a paper towel with dirty hands, and I feel like we use less paper towels overall. It’s easy to install, easy to program, and easy to replace the roll."" —Mlc Get it from Amazon for $99.99 (available in three colors).  Promising review: ""I like iced coffee with high caffeine. This fits the bill perfectly and is a joy to use and drink. My Starbucks monthly bill has come down considerably after buying this unit, and I'm ready to hit the ground running that much sooner in the morning. I especially enjoy the self cleaning feature and the ability to run it for smaller or larger cup sizes. Truly a premium product."" —David T. Get it from Amazon for $219.95+ (available in three colors, plus in bundle options with the Aeroccino milk frother). Adaptive Sound Technologies is a small business established in 2009 specializing in sound technology for personal care.  Psst — it's compatible with speakers *and* headphones, so if you're sharing the room you don't have to subject your partner to it. Promising review: ""I have suffered from insomnia all my life, and have found if I fall asleep listening to something I sleep better. I tried falling asleep to the TV, but invariably around 3 a.m., I would wake up listening to infomercials. Then, while traveling, my husband and I stayed in a very nice hotel that had this product in our room. I tried it, and slept like a baby the whole time we were there! I knew I had to have one at home, and ordered this as soon as we got home. I love that it has so many different sounds to choose from, as well as volume adjustment. You can leave it on all night or set the timer to shut off. This is a fantastic product, and while not inexpensive, in my opinion, well worth the money."" —Tamstrat Get it from Amazon for $88.23+ (available in two colors and two designs). Check out a TikTok of the bamboo plant stand in action.  Promising review: ""I decided to get this shelf as a plant stand and I’m so happy I did! All in all assembly took around five minutes, and the instructions were very straight forward. The shelf as a whole has a very slight wobble to it when standing by itself on a flat smooth surface, but when placed against a wall or railing there is no wobble at all. If you are planning to use this shelf as a plant stand I would highly recommend flipping the shelves upside down for assembly, this gives you a lip on the outer edge of the shelves so things are less likely to slide off or tip over during heavy winds."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $54.39+ (clip the 20% off coupon on the product page for this price; available in two colors). Wine Nook is a small business specializing in wine accessories for home and event use.  Promising review: ""I switched to boxed wine as my town no longer recycles glass and I felt horrible just throwing the bottles away. As much as I like my faves (Black Box Cab and Bota Nighthawk Black), the boxes looked crummy. This fixed all that! It looks great sitting on my butler's pantry shelf against the liquor bottles. Very fun! Note, you will remove the bag of wine from the box and set it inside, the the shape of your box doesn't matter. A+!"" —AmandaFMascio Get it from Amazon for $79.99 (available in five colors).  Check out a TikTok of the portable shopping trolley in action.  Promising review: ""I love this bag so much. I felt like I was always carrying either a really heavy bag or several bags and having to switch things around to make them fit. After my physical therapist suggested I change something up, I started looking for rolling bags. After finding a ton of ugly solutions, I ran across this and couldn’t have been more thrilled. (Well, maybe if it wasn’t so expensive….) already familiar with the brand I decided to purchase, and I’m so glad I did. I get compliments every time I use it, and it’s so practical as well as cute."" —Julia Get it from Amazon for $179.95 (available in seven colors).  I bought one of these as an apartment-warming gift for my own darn self and I love it to pieces. It's compact so it doesn't take up much space, but adds a lovely sophistication to the corner of the room. Plus it just makes me so happy to see my favorite vinyls all on display like decor, and not have to be scrambling around under the bed or on a random shelf where I used to keep them so they'd be 'safe.' This came fully constructed, too, so there was no hassle pulling it straight out of the box. These are so popular that they're constantly on backorder, so a heads up you might have to wait a few weeks depending on what color you choose — but it is *seriously* worth it!  Promising review: ""I love this record player. It fits so perfect in my studio apartment and the size is incredible for those small spaces that aren’t as easy to fill. It fits my record player perfectly and I love the second shelf to add extra touches."" —shanellllea Get it from Urban Outfitters for $99 (originally $119; available in two colors).  You can even toggle through Samsung's ""art store"" to find a display to match the vibe of the room (or just your vibe of the day). It also has Alexa built in, so you can open apps, change the channel, search for movies and shows, play music, and control your smarthome devices from the television. Here's what BuzzFeeder Mallory Mower has to say about it: ""This is honest and truly the best splurge I have ever made. It has massively upgraded the look in my living room. My husband loves the photography options and I love all the classical paintings. As someone who loves changing up my decor, I find that being able to update the display images has been so fun. The quality is fantastic while watching movies and TV...but I'm pretty sure I love it as a piece of art in my home even more."" Get it from Amazon for $763.51+ (available in six sizes, six styles, and with or without expert installation). Promising review: ""Love this little miracle worker! I have never used a power washer before. And this was easy to assemble and easy to use. It did such a great job. My neighbors even remarked on how great my driveway and sidewalks looked!"" —a human Get it from Amazon for $199.  Check out a TikTok of the table in action.  Promising review: ""I’m obsessed with my coffee table. It’s the perfect size for my studio apartment and looks so great with the rest of my furniture. Plus, I get tons of compliments on it from guests! It’s easy to clean and I think a great price."" —Alexia Get it from Amazon for $145+ (available in three sizes). Hug Sleep is a Wisconsin-based, family-owned small business that specializes in quality products to improve sleep.  Promising review: ""Sleeping through the night (and falling asleep) is a challenge for me. I use a weighted blanket, medication, nighttime routines, you name it, but I have PTSD and I often wake up from nightmares or for no reason at all and cannot fall back asleep. This has been a GAME CHANGER for me ‚ if I wake up in the night and remembered to wear it, I’m back asleep in minutes! Even putting it on in the middle of the night puts me straight back to sleep."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $69.99 (available in five sizes). Options include everything from margaritas, whiskey sours, and old fashioneds, and the machine even self-cleans at the end of each cocktail to prevent flavors from leaking into other drinks.  Promising review: ""Finally made the purchase (TikTok did it...brilliant marketing!) as a gift to my wife. The packaging was great. Was delivered one day early and very quick. We are really enjoying the machine and sharing it with friends. Overall, it feels a bit pricey, but well worth it considering the fun, variety, and novelty. The drinks are good!"" —Pepstero Get it from Amazon for $347.17.  Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."

All hail this rapid veggie chopper that's about to win you back half your evening. BuzzFeed Staff Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines.  I bought this and love it! I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.  Promising review: ""This was another one of my TikTok purchases! I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth, so I thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazingly! My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard, those tiny bristles really get in there, and if you push too hard, you nights be sore like I was. It felt like after going to a dental cleaning."" —AN  Get a two-pack from Amazon for $8.91.  Promising review: ""Saves me from auto logouts! My brother recommended this handy gadget. I work from home and have three monitors. When I leave my desk for lunch, the computer goes to sleep and when I come back, everything is logged out and whatever was on three monitors ends up on two. SO frustrating. This is programmable for three settings and I use it on the minimal movement so when I come back, everything is just as I left it. Revolutionary! Just remember to turn it on!"" —Isaiah Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in eight colors). Promising review: ""I have ordered this twice now. If my skin is breaking out I just spray this on after washing my face and let it air dry. It is non irritating and non drying. It has a light chlorine smell to me. I can use both morning and night with no irritation. After a few days of this my skin starts clearing up! I put some in a travel spray bottle and take it when I’m flying. My skin always feels dirty on planes and I spray it on a few times on travel days to freshen my face and hopefully kill some bacteria. It sprays over makeup with no issues."" —SaraSmile11 Get it from Amazon for $17.46.  Promising review: ""I saw this product on TikTok and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn’t lie — spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner. Usually I’ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, include soap scum. I’ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then will take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise it’s a worthy cleaning staple in my house."" —Tara D.  Get it from Amazon for $19.28+ (available in two scents and two sizes).   Fullstar is a small business established in 2017 that specializes in kitchen gadgets.  Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action.  Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.87 (available in three styles).  Sagely is a family-owned small business founded by husband-and-wife team Ellie Glazer and Ivor Miskulin, who spent three years designing the ideal, stress-free pill storage solution. The silicone lids are super secure, but also designed for gentle and easy opening and closing to account for users with dexterity issues. Promising review: ""Love this thing!!! I'm only 30 and didn't want an old lady pill box... and this one was modern and cool. The little slots to push in pills is fantastic and the containers are very large. It keeps my huge vitamin pills on either side and could fit over 10 large ones if needed. Love this thing. Worth the price and looks like it'll last forever. I do wish the magnets were stronger. They just keep them in place but will slide off if bumped. I assume this is helpful for people with arthritis. It's an easy fix. I take down one days worth of pills, set it on my counter and now I'm not too lazy to take my pills!"" —Chicken McNugget Get it from Amazon for $34.99 (available in four styles).  This device contains one full phone charge, meaning you can get the Apple Watch and an iPhone up to about 50% each from zero, if you use the charger on both.

The 12-ounce Stojo cup I purchased is very practical. It is thick and durable. The plastic collar enables you to hold the cup without squeezing it or burning your hands on the hot walls of the cup. There is enough volume in the cup to allow for the 12-ounce brew plus ample creamer. It's not a stainless vacuum cup, but it does hold its temperature better than your typical gas station or coffee shop cup. Plus you have the advantage of being able to reheat your drink in the microwave which you can't do with a stainless cup.  —ViciousCycle Get it from Amazon for $14.95+ (available in four sizes and 24 colors).  Promising review: ""This is the best way to have coffee without the acid and still have the caffeine.

I saw it on TikTok and figured I would give it a try. My grandmother passed away almost eight years ago, and she left me her first engagement ring in her will. I have tried so many jewelry cleaners, toothpaste and toothbrush, you name it, tried everything except for sending it away to get cleaned. I ordered the Diamond Dazzle Stik on Thursday and it arrived the following Saturday, fast shipping! Today is Sunday and I cleaned my ring with the Diamond Dazzle Stik. My ring is just as shiny as it was when my grandfather bought it for my grandmother many many years ago. I will definitely use this Diamond Dazzle Stik on all my jewelry. Highly recommended!"" —Heather Get it from Amazon for $9.48. Quick & Clean is a small business that specializes in coffee machine cleaning products.  Promising review: ""I had no idea that cleaning a Keurig was a thing.

My Keurig wasn’t as nasty as some I’ve seen, lucky. I would highly recommend, keeps everything running correctly and clean."" —Lauren Get a set of six from Amazon for $9.95.

Kitchen Gizmos is a small business that specializes in kitchen accessories.  Promising review: ""I've owned this for about six months, and I couldn't imagine cooking without it. I hate strainers. They are bulky and fill up the dishwasher, I'm lazy, whatever. This strainer is a lifesaver. Clip it on your pan, strain, and voila! And it is so easy to clean. A little hot water and it's good to go for the next round. I highly recommend this gadget, it will retire your current strainer."" —Viola Evens ""Godsend. Saw on a TikTok cooking video.

Ramos Get it from Amazon for $20.53 (available in two colors).  Promising review: ""The set comes in various colors and they are all beautiful. The polish has a big brush that covers the nail easily. The polish is opaque but I did two coats. It didn't stain my nails or has a strong smell. The polish dried up quickly. I cook and clean, so it started to wear off on the fourth day. But I can repaint because of the easy application and fast drying."" —perksofbeautyblog Get 10 bottles from Amazon for $13.99 (available in five color combinations). Promising review: ""These bowls are high quality and very convenient. They heat up food very quickly and evenly, saving you valuable time and energy. Its ability to heat the food and not the bowl itself is very valuable to me. Prior to this purchase, I would have to use a hot bowl holder to avoid burning my fingers.

I really dislike putting anything heavy on my face and prefer a gel-like consistency. I am a big fan of the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid serum and the texture of this sunscreen feels pretty close to that. I have tried much more expensive 'serum' sunscreens and find this one my favorite and for a much better price point."" —JHoch Get it from Amazon for $14.12.  Promising review: ""LOVE IT! I am very picky when it comes to water bottles, but this one is perfect! It is 32 ounces so it holds a lot of water to drink throughout the day!

Promising review: ""This deluxe shaving mirror saves me about 15 minutes in the morning. If you're anything like me, 15 minutes in the morning is like an hour in daytime hours. Filling the back with water that goes in the back of the mirror only takes about 10 seconds and discarding the water after shaving takes about five seconds. Shaving in the shower with all the steam makes your shaving experience much closer and comfortable, I find. No more going to the sink, washing my face, shaving, AND THEN stumbling to the shower. Excellent way to start the day... and with much less stumbling, my chances are much greater in making it to work... LOL."" —Nicholas Get it from Amazon for $39.95.  Promising review: ""I got tired of a collection of ratty, cheap reusable bags that were collected from various grocery stores over the years. I replaced them all with these. Excellent purchase. They are larger, sturdier and better made than any of the bags I had in the past. They also look really nice. I will never go back to the sort of cheap reusable bags I had in the past."" —David H.  Get a set of four from Amazon for $29.99 (available in three colors).  Promising review: ""I have to say, I was skeptical about this product from all the TikTok hype about it but after trying it out, it really does work. I’ve used whitening strips before but those usually hurt my sensitive teeth and I hate the taste of some of the other gels on the market but this one was super easy and didn’t hurt my teeth at all and didn’t taste much different than my regular toothpaste, since I got the mint-flavored one. I used it for a few weeks before my brother’s wedding and it worked like a charm. I noticed visible results in only a couple of days and was able to keep using it until I reached my desired shade of white. 10/10 would recommend for anyone with sensitive teeth and tastes!"" —Victoria Bravo Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.96 (clip the 50% off coupon on the product page for this price).  Promising review: ""I was skeptical but I was also tired of cleaning my air fryer of crumbs all the time. I have a PowerXl air fryer and one of these fits perfectly in there. I can do French fries or any other fried food and discard the liner and the fryer is still nice and clean. I use two when I do juicy items, hot dogs, chicken breast, sausage and when I'm done I take out the meat and lift out the liners and all the gross juice comes out with it leaving the fryer ready to clean in the sink with hot water, no gross juice to pour out or get in the sink.

It's a small container, but it lasts a very long time because a little really does go a long way! I also do this the night before so the powder-y look goes away by morning and it's more absorbed, you can also add a light oil to your ends and work it up if it feels too dry. There's no scent either and it is very convenient for travel! This is the only thing that still makes my hair look 'clean' on the no hair wash days!"" —Alice Get it from Amazon for $18. Promising review: ""I bought this because my daughter told me she has had one for four years, and it still works great. They enjoy wine and use it. It is so comfortable to use; I have shoulder problems, so that is important. I've used it for about a month now, which is longer than the $$$ one from Williams Sonoma, which died an ugly death. And it doesn't twist forcibly and hurt my shoulder like others I've had. So I am very impressed. The accompanying foil cutter is the best I've ever had, by the way!"" —Midge Get it from Amazon for $34.  Promising review: ""I love this toaster! It has all the options I need: lifter, countdown timer, visual icon of the toast colors, and all the toast varieties anyone could want, from white to grain to bagel to waffle to English muffin to gluten-free.

It's made my mornings much more tolerable. And it's so easy to clean!"" —JTC  Get it from Amazon for $44.99 (available in four styles).  HELLO, I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE. Despite all the rave reviews I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and make a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again — these are worth every damn penny.  Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.97.  Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."

BuzzFeed Contributor HuffPost Staff Promising review: ""I'm a makeup artist and kept hearing from others about how face shaving (derma-planing) makes makeup look better and makes skin glowy, and decided why not, let's try it! And I'm so impressed! I wish I had a picture of how much white peach fuzz came off in small strokes as I was using this! I loved it as an eyebrow tool, too. It's important to properly cleanse before using as you will be opening up your pores in the process for exfoliating, some of the reviews said they broke out and I imagine it's because they didn't properly cleanse. From research, they recommend not wearing makeup the day you use this and applying moisturizer after. I dipped the blade in rubbing alcohol to sanitize after using, too. I don't know how some reviews said they cut theirselves with this tool, I was nervous to try this because of those reviews but honestly no. Hold the tool at a 45-degree angle, make small strokes downward and hold the skin taut on the area you are shaving, and you'll be fine. Give it a try!"" —dl Get a three-count from Amazon for $4.94 (also available as a pack of nine). Promising review: ""I am a makeup artist. This mascara outperforms nearly every other mascara I have used, and I am 55 and have purchased and used an innumerable amount of drugstore and specialty mascaras.

Promising review: ""Pro makeup artist favorite! You really can’t beat the price for such a good product! This adds so much dimension to the brow and really holds it in place. For thicker, unruly brows you may need a few coats but for most people, just one to two thin coats will keep them lifted all day and not crunchy or hard. There is also no white residue if you work quickly and in thin layers."" —alicia Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (also available in four other colors).

Easiest eye EVER and perfect for those who have a hard time with this look! Even we makeup artists (I personally have over 20 years experience) will take an easy way out!!

This is what I needed to hear! Finding a good shadow primer is like the holy grail in the life of a makeup artist. I have used many products and wasted a lot of money and I believe I found a winner with Elizabeth Mott’s product! I am thankful and impressed!"" —Miss Lilly Get it from Amazon for $13.99. Promising review: ""I don’t think I’ve ever left a review on Amazon before. This eye cream is THAT good. I worked as a makeup artist for years and am still a product lover. I’ve been using an eye cream daily since I was 19 (over a decade), so have tried lots of brands, and this stuff is phenomenal! It’s now become my go-to cream for my face, eyes, neck, AND décolletage. My skin veers toward dry and I haven’t found a face cream I like as much as this that isn’t $75, so I just use it all over. The jar is big enough for that and a little goes a LONG way. Use this cream twice a day under the eye, and you will fall in love, too. I keep telling people about this and sending them the link so they can buy their own. I just randomly found this on Amazon while browsing and feel like I hit the jackpot. I hope they never stop making it."" —L.R. Get it from Amazon for $14.99. To use the blending sponge, wet your sponge and squeeze out excess water so that it's damp, not soaking. For extra high-coverage looks, trying using the sponge dry. Promising review: ""I’m a professional makeup artist and I can seriously tell you I will never switch again! These sponges are by far better than brands like Beauty Blenders, Real Techniques, etc. They are not stiff, which makes the makeup apply beautifully and seamlessly.

This brush is best used wet for applying makeup and can be used on powder or liquid formulas. Promising reviews: ""I was looking for a makeup brush and came across this little gem. I was hesitant for a couple of reasons. First off, the price! I thought surely nothing of quality could come at this price. Also, I wasn't familiar with this brand or type of brush. After reading some reviews and researching a bit more I figured why not. After all, its cheap enough. I was beyond surprised when it arrived. First of all it came in this little container that can be great for travel or just storage in general! Loved that! Then felt the bristles and used it for the first time. Wow! Just wow! It worked amazing. I use it for blending foundation and it works 💯 better than expected. I can't believe how impressed I am with this product. It feels wonderful on my face and is completely easy to do a quick wipe off. Its definitely worth the low price.

Try it!!!"" —Taylor Get it from Amazon for $6.89+ (available in 12 colors). Promising review: ""As a pro makeup artist I find myself reaching for these more than any of my lux brand lip products. Literally every shade is gorgeous. The large applicator applies the product smoothly and quickly. I cannot say enough good things about this product. An amazing value.

You will not be disappointed."" —Justin Case Get it from Amazon for $8.25+ (available in 19 colors). Promising review: ""As a makeup artist, I’m always trying to find new products to moisturize the under-eye area, which is a particularly dry area for most of my clients. I absolutely love these patches, as they also help with dark under-eye circles! I usually keep them in the fridge so they are cool when I place them on my clients' faces, leave it for 10 minutes and it immediately looks like they got the best facial of their lives!!!

I’ve used it alone to create a soft-focus and to prepare my skin for powder blush and highlighter, and used it over liquid foundation. It’s so finely milled it’s a joy to apply. Comes with a little puff — I use a powder brush for application. The scent is soft and doesn’t stay once you’ve applied it. I love the smell. If you’re searching for a nice translucent powder, this one has been around for decades and is a deal on top of everything else!!

Spritz on your skin morning and night, or whenever your skin needs a little extra TLC. I finally bought a bottle of this, and I'm so glad I did. It soothes my parched skin, and I can tell it's calming irritation, too — I recently noticed an incoming perioral dermatitis breakout (an acne-rosacea hybrid that's notoriously difficult to treat), and after a few days of using this, the bumps and redness on my face were completely gone. It saved me from needing to scramble for an expensive treatment, which is kind of unbelievable. It also makes my skin feel more hydrated and more balanced. This thing is understated but mighty, and has a permanent place in my skincare collection. Promising review: ""This is a must-have in both my professional kit and my personal kit.

Promising review: ""This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I’m an esthetician/makeup artist and have spent so much money on skincare. This is by far my favorite product. I use it at night, mainly on my face, and my skin soaks it right up. Does not break me out. I love a dewy look to my skin so I also use it under my makeup. You have to warm it up in your hands before applying. It will leave a glow to the skin. It makes skin sooo much softer and decreases texture and discoloration. It has a herbal smell, which I enjoy, but it’s an acquired smell. I’ve read reviews saying it doesn’t absorb but I didn’t experience that. I use a pea sized amount, rub it between my hands for five seconds and pat it gently into my face. I have combination to oily skin."" —Alex pope Get it from Amazon for $14.99.

It doesn’t break, I just lost mine. You can’t find it in the store. It sharpens lipliners or small eyeliners, and it sharpens large pencils as well.

Will buy again. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"" —Andrea Get it from Amazon for $5.89+ (available in three sizes).  Promising reviews: ""Loooooove this. I've used a lot of glitter primers and usually they work for a little while an hour, maybe two, and never up against sweat. I used this on Halloween and am now using it to swatch any of my glitters for nails or makeup. And this holds AMAZINGLY. I did dishes and made lunch while having the pictured snowflake on to swatch glitter colors and it did not budge, I had to use micellar water and a makeup wipe just to get it off a little. So definitely recommend!"" —Seriously Lacqueing ""I’m a professional makeup artist and I use this on all my glitter-eyed brides. My brides always gave me positive feedback about glitter staying all throughout the day/night. I would recommend this 100%. Also, for the price it is WORTH IT."" —Shruti Get it from Amazon for $6.49. It contains 12 shades, with matte, shimmer, and metallic options. It's also cruelty-free. Promising reviews: ""Beautiful colors! I'm a professional makeup artist and this is my favorite palette. I actually love the brush that comes with it, too."" —makeupdiva12001 ""All the brides I've had always ask me for looks that this palette holds. Goes well with a lot of natural looks, whether meeting your mother-in-law for the first time or a midday brunch. Looks amazing on older clients, too. Highly recommend this to all makeup artists, folks with lots of brunch dates and people over 50 that want to look radiant and fresh! Love love love!"" —BeautifulEden Get it from Sephora for $59. These babies have adhesive on back so nothing moves around in the process. Promising reviews: ""My prayers were finally answered. I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time. It keeps eye shadow from getting on the cheeks, which tends to happen every time I apply eyeshadow. These strips catch all the falling eye makeup. I’m glad I found them. Highly recommend."" —Frequent shopper  ""I am a makeup artist and I love these for sharp lines. I will say the adhesive is very strong so my tip is to stick it in the back of your hand twice first and get some of the strong adhesive worn down."" —Leila VonSleichter Get a 120-pack from Amazon for $6.99.  You'll get one lip plumper and one minty sleeping mask for your lips. Promising reviews: ""I loved this stuff, it was magic. The evening moisturizer was fabulous. It is the first plumper that actually works for me. Will be buying more for gifts!!!!!"" —Alexandra ""I love this duo!!! I am a makeup artist so I've tried almost every lip plumper on the market! This is a great value since you get two different products for lower than the cost of one tube by other brands. Keeps my lips hydrated as I live in dry Arizona. I'm so excited I came across this!"" —Mandy Burden Get it from Amazon for $9.98. Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."

Pulling out your s'mores caddy at the next family get-together knowing everyone is going to ask where they can get one is a bold move. BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""Absolutely love this product. I used it when my son was only about 6–9-months-old, and I still use it now as he is 15-months-old. I just love this product. It is so easy to use the babies. Love it as they get to be in the water as well; this product also dries very quickly. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the water with their children. An added benefit is that you are hands free!"" —H&M Miller Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). The liners come with trimming guidelines so that you can cut the insert to your desired size. Promising review: ""I can't recommend these inserts enough! After a week of heavy use, they hardly smell. Pop them in the wash, and they are ready to go again! Super comfy and doesn't move around. So nice to have in shoes you don't feel like wearing socks with! Plus, so many fun patterns!"" —Vicky L. Parr Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes [fits women's sizes 6–13] and four colors). Promising review: ""Scummy water bugging you? I just got this gem of a product last night. I popped it into my hot tub, and from the picture I attached, you can see that in just about 12 hours, this little Scumbug ate up all the oil and filth in the hot tub. The water not only looks better but smells better, too! Highly recommended!"" —Mickey D. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.99. Reviewers recommend using a more watery sunscreen; if your preferred sunscreen is quite thick, this may not work for you. And JSYK, the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD) says most adults need about an ounce (the equivalent of a shot glass) of sunscreen to cover their face and body adequately. Promising review: ""Not just for kids. I told all my friends it's awesome. Pricey, but better than wasting expensive sunscreen in globs. This makes the sun screening process much less messy and not as much of a drudgery. They even have replacement pads available so the ergonomic container can be reused indefinitely. Consider one to keep at home and one packed to travel. MAKES A GREAT GIFT FOR KIDS. They can almost apply sunscreen on their own with little assistance."" —Bette Henry Get it from Amazon for $15.98 (available in six colors and a two-pack). Shakalo is a small business based in San Diego. Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1–2 times a week. And I even use it on my dogs paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of too. I will definitely be buying the refill & another baggie to have exclusively in the car."" —Gabbs Uresti Get it from Amazon for $24.99. This toy is designed for dogs who are light to medium chewers. Promising review: ""I got this to keep my dog cool for his first trip to the beach, and he loved it! He seemed to be more interested after it sat out for a minute or so, but he was completely occupied by it!!"" —Olivia Sizler Get it from Amazon for $5.99. Promising review: ""Last-minute purchase for a trip to Jamaica. So happy I bought them. They always kept our towels on the chairs correctly. It was also easy to tell our chairs apart from others on the resort. Will definitely be recommending them to others."" —RG Get a four-pack from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in five colors). Food is not included in the box. Promising review: ""We spend a lot of time at the backyard firepit. We used to use a simple disposable container to hold our s'mores fixins. Our kids chose this as a Christmas gift for my wife, but we all enjoy it! The latches and handle are sturdy, and the sides are easily wiped clean but not easily scuffed. It fits everything we need in one tidy and very easily identifiable box...at a glance, you know exactly what's in it! After each use, we simply restock it and stick it in the garage refrigerator until the next time. Kids love it, my wife loves it, and even I love it. Not to mention the many compliments we get at the family fishing trip campfires. Would definitely recommend!"" —Craig Get it from Amazon for $28.50. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action.  Promising review: ""No complaints just satisfied. It worked. We were surprised that such a small bracelet could keep us bug free but it did."" —M. A. Cooper Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $9.99.  Promising review: ""I'm extremely satisfied with this chair. The back is nicely padded for comfort. The harness straps are secure. I put my 3-month-old in the chair and was confident she was not going anywhere. The legs are very supportive and keep the chair balanced. This chair will not easily tip over at all. It's easy to set up; just one push down to lock it in and pull up to close. It is a touch and positive lock in place to open; it won't accidentally close. We have used this chair at home so far but can't wait to use it camping and at the beach."" —MH Get it from Amazon for $50 (available in pink and teal — and tons of other colors). Promising review: ""Watching these burn is absolutely peaceful and mesmerizing! They actually last for a good 20 minutes as well."" —Stella Get six packets from Amazon for $6.94. Promising review: ""First, as a swimsuit, it is incredibly endearing. The English floral pattern is SO lovely. The reverse is just as eye-catching. The length seemed a little short initially, but it ended up holding my body in and giving my chest a lift. I considered sizing up, but the way it ends up looking, I think the size is just right. You can tie the shoulders to the desired/required length. It's thick, so nothing shows through. It's somehow conservative and sexy at the same time. What I really love is that I can wear this as a bodysuit and with some high-waisted pants, it's a stunner!"" —Lily Get it from Amazon for $33.99 (available in women's sizes 2–14 and eight colors). Promising review: ""This stuff is AMAZING! Literally nothing else keeps tangles out of my daughter’s hair like this does. Her hair is so thick and very difficult to brush; this makes it easy peasy to brush the tangles out after a swim in the pool. It also softens her hair. When not used, the pool chemicals make her hair very stiff and dry. We even use this every once in a while just because! It smells wonderful and doesn’t make the hair greasy in any way. I cannot recommend this product enough!!!"" —Emily Gardner Get it from Amazon for $19.99. Promising review: ""This product definitely solved our 'car seat getting super hot' problem. My daughter loves it, and she even tells me, 'Mama please remember the car seat cover,' so it’s toddler approved."" —Kiara N. Hernandez Get it from Amazon for $14.99. Promising review: "" Perfect for my little one! My back seats don't have air vents, and I noticed even on days when it wasn't really that hot out, she was soaking wet in her car seat. After installing this, we've had no issues, and it cools her off within seconds! 🫶🏻"" —jaimee Get it from Amazon for $64.95+ (available in two colors and three lengths). Promising review: ""I traveled to Italy this summer, and this thing was a lifesaver. It was so hot there, and I was drenched in sweat, but after using this, I no longer looked sticky or shiny. 10/10 would recommend."" —Shyenne Get it from Amazon for $9.98. Promising review: ""I love these. I have a few cute summer dresses with sleeves — eeek! The first time I tried the shields it was 104 degrees at an outdoor event, and I was sweating bullets! The shields worked BEAUTIFULLY. Not a sweat stain in sight."" —Cosmic Girl Get a pack of 24 from Amazon for $14.99. Promising review: ""So, when I was buying a large beach umbrella, it was suggested that I buy the table. I was really on the fence about buying it, but I said to myself it would be nice to have things off the ground. Well, we went to the beach with about eight of us, and everybody loved it and started to use it. I think it is such a smart concept, and I will eventually buy another one since I bought two umbrellas. Don't double think, just get it."" —CB Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""Great cart! We love the ease of use. It folds up pretty flat (except, of course, for the balloon wheels) and fits easily in the trunk. It can hold an impressive amount of gear! We have packed it with two large beach chairs, a small cooler, drinks, speakers, blankets, towels, a diaper bag, an umbrella, a small baby tent, a little table, flip-flops, drinks, etc., and we still have room for more. The balloon wheels are THE ONLY way to travel through deep, soft sand. Even when loaded down, it is very easy to tilt the cart back on the two big balloon wheels and roll through the sand. Other carts's wheels just bog down and get dragged through the sand or dig in and become unmoveable, making it a miserable trip. We live in Pensacola and visit the beach constantly, so we hope the cart holds up! So far, it seems sturdy and shows no signs of failing. Best beach cart we have owned so far!"" —Jboogy Groove Get it from Amazon for $239.99+ (available in two styles and three colors). Air Boss Motion Decoys is the Texas-based small biz behind the Krapp Strapp and other hunting decoys and gear.  Promising review: ""Perfect gift for the avid hunter in your life."" —Shine with Prime Get it from Amazon for $69.99.  Promising review: ""When I purchased these, the appeal was the dustless part and the fact that they were cleaner to use. But I can't tell you how amazing these ended up being. They were better than expected. I know these are made for outdoor play, but my daughter took it upon herself, as any 2-year-old would, to draw on our slider door window. I realized these wash off so easily with water, and now this is what she uses them for. Art on the window. I plan to order again once she goes through the ones we have. Total game changer and keeps her occupied with mommy working from home. These are a must buy!!"" —Nicole Margiotta Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $13.98. Promising review: ""Liquid IV does an amazing job hydrating. I purchase their product for 40+ employees who work in a construction-related industry. Hydration is so important while working in the hot Georgia Sun, and this product aids in this 100%. Now, let’s talk about the firecracker flavor! When we produced these for our crew, ages 23–60, all of their eyes lit up, and they were super excited. Many of them did not know this flavor existed. Quite honestly, I didn’t either until I came across them on Amazon. They all loved the flavor. In particular, the ones who were older kept telling me it tasted like their childhood. Seriously, who hasn’t stood outside an ice cream truck ordering the Firecracker Popsicle?"" —Disney Diva Get a 16-pack from Amazon for $24.99. Promising review: ""In July, my sister and I, aka The Grandmas, had a week that we were challenged to keep four kids between the ages of 5–11 busy and motivated. We wanted just a really fun time for little to no extra cost, hence the purchase of Twister Splash. I bought it on a lark and just hoped it would absorb one hot morning or afternoon. Well, it lived up to the hype. Those kids could not wait to play. Hours spent in the sunshine screaming, laughing, and getting soaking wet while trying to reach the right color with the left foot. Hilarious! They wanted to play every day. It was economical, fun, and so easy to set up and take down!! The kids have already requested we have it next year and we are looking forward to more fun in the sun with Twister Splash!!"" —Melissa Applewhite Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in an XL size for more players). Promising review: ""Love that these come with a clip. Makes it so handy to travel with and not lose any of the cards. Great for kids, too, because they always seem to break the box when they have to put them back in the box. Of course, the waterproof aspect is wonderful!"" —Peachy Keenes Get it from Amazon for $13.95. And come fall and winter, you can crank up the heat in your bed without having to warm the whole house! Promising review: ""Super easy to assemble and run! The remote is simple but has so many options! I didn’t even buy the 'add on' sheet, and this thing has CHANGED OUR LIVES!! Our dogs no longer get hot and get up and down off the bed. My husband was shocked at how cool he gets even though it’s on my side (he’s a hot sleeper, too!). We use it on the lowest setting, and I know this thing will MORE than pay for itself in electricity bills this summer! (We usually sleep with it on 63 and hot flashes have now set in so I wasn’t sure how we would survive the Southern summer heat.😖) HUGE FANS OF THE BED JET!"" —Melissa W. Get it from Amazon for $489. Promising reviews: ""Such a cute and comfortable matching set. Perfect for a hot summer day!"" —Julia McHale ""This two-piece set is seriously the best. I ended up buying it in different colors because I love it so much. I’ve had two kids and don’t typically wear crop tops, etc., but I decided to try this anyway and loved it! I wore these in Disney and received a ton of compliments and felt great!"" —Liz Claire Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and 11 colors). Promising review: ""My back used to be so pale compared to my front by the end of the summer because it always hurt my neck to lie on my stomach, and I couldn't read my books! Not with this chair!! I can sip on a marg while reading, and getting my back tanned all at the same time!!! The face cushions are super comfy, and the chair is very well made. Now — create one of these with a cutout for a pregnant belly, and you'll have me sold on a second one!"" —Macie Jackson Get it from Amazon for $64.99 (available in 10 colors). Promising review: ""I threw these in my bag last minute for a trip to a resort in Cancun, and we absolutely loved them! They take up no room, and I easily fit two pillows in my carry-on bag to have for the beach. Made the beach chairs so much more relaxing by being able to be comfortable. They blew up so easily. It just took four big breaths for each pillow. Loved that I could either use the straps or sand to hold them in place. I also liked the idea of traveling with them in my carry-on in case we had a delayed flight, and I had enough time for an airport nap. I'll be bringing these on all future vacations."" —Nikki Miller Get it from Amazon for $35 (available in seven colors). Promising review: ""These are big enough for various size cups as you can see in the photos. I like that they come stackable and in a little mesh carrying bag. I also like that it comes with four, so you can share it with friends. It isn’t easily knocked over, it’s tall enough to stay sturdy in the sand, and they’re not bulky to carry in your beach bag. Definitely recommend!"" —Brittsface Get a four-pack from Amazon for $12.99. Promising review: ""We wanted an umbrella we could take to the beach on our bikes and when we travel. This umbrella is awesome. It is light, easy to set up, and works on windy and non-windy days with anchors. We have used it on LBI, Key Largo, and Marathon — we always are able to get a full day of shade. We are very happy with the product."" —Dawgs Get it from Amazon for $179. Promising review: ""This has been a wonderful product! I was a little skeptical because of the price, and our pit has skin issues, as a lot of pits do, but this works great. He was going out and getting very pink colored on the white parts of his coat, becoming even more itchy than usual with his skin issues, and you could tell it was bothersome. I asked my vet about this, and she said it was OK to use, so I tried it a little bit first to see if he had any issues. There were none, so I used it all over. I couldn’t believe the difference! This is definitely worth the price! He can now go out even in the hot sun (of course, with breaks) and not get pinkish/red all where the white is. He knows he has to get it on and really doesn’t like it but he doesn’t like baths, rain, or to be wet at all. Once it’s put on, I let him sit inside or in the shade for it to dry before going out in sun exposure, just as I do for regular sunscreen, and it seems to work great. I could tell a difference when my husband took him out without it; you could see he was pink again compared to going out with it on."" —Awesome amazon customer Get it from Amazon for $13.95+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""I got absolutely FRIED at the beach this past weekend and tried everything under the sun (literally) to provide some relief for my sunburn. I was in so much pain, and every over-the-counter aloe gel, lidocaine, and cold shower was not helping. I found this wrap on my TikTok and immediately bought it. As soon as I put this on my burn, I was immediately relieved of any burning or irritation. I am wearing four patches right now, and I plan on wearing them all day, every day until this burn heals. I will say the only downside is they slip off the aloe has worn off! And it is a little bit hard to maneuver to cut since it is so slippery. But overall, I love this product and will be a forever customer!"" —Nick Get it from Amazon for $19.99. Splash Place is a woman-owned family business based in Arizona! Promising review: ""My daughter tried the other version of swim goggles that you normally find in a store but had difficulty using them. We purchased these instead, and I cannot give them a better recommendation. They are absolutely easier to put on, and they do not pull hair like the others. I will buy more as long as these are available, and I will gladly recommend them to anyone."" —Lisa Krause Get it from Amazon for $24.95 (available in 10 styles and additional prints).  Promising review: ""I bought one for me and one for my dad after getting caught in a rip current at the beach. We feel much safer with the swim bubble. They are easy to blow up at the beach, easy to attach to the waist, very light and unobtrusive, and great to hold and float in the ocean. I feel much safer knowing I can grab onto it at any time and float if I get tired."" —LD Get it from Amazon for $29.95 (available in four colors and a version that comes with a dry bag for a phone, etc.). Promising review: ""I absolutely love this dress! I usually wear this dress for date night or a dinner party since I ordered it in black. This dress can be dressed up or dressed down, any way you prefer it. I usually like wearing gold bracelets, earrings, and some heels to elevate the look of the dress. Other times, wearing a cute pair of flats is the perfect look to wear with it on vacation. The dress is super comfortable to wear, and the length comes to and around my ankles. I ask my husband to adjust the straps for me since they're tie-on, but I have been able to do it myself, just not the tightest how I like it. Aside from that, before every wear I do iron it because it tends to get crumbled easily. However, ironing takes literally five minutes to get all the creases out. I would highly recommend this dress! Super cute, easy to wear, comfortable, and a great date night outfit!"" —T Get it from Amazon for $49.99 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and 24 colors; this plus-size version is very similar!).

Promising review: ""If you're like me and have oily/combo skin that is also sensitive and prone to acne, this is an excellent product worth its price. Very little goes a long way since the slimy texture glides right over the skin. It does not leave any sticky residue, on the contrary, it is absorbed into the skin very quickly. It also keeps the skin moisturized but does not trap oil, in fact, I find my skin to be less oily after a few days of using it!"" —Madeline Get it from Amazon for $15.99. Promising review: ""I don’t write reviews often but this product, through some kind of magic, is a lifesaver. I don’t know how, but it takes care of everything. I’ve struggled with enlarged pores, combination skin, cystic acne, and constant breakouts for over a decade. This is the first product that makes an impact on my skin. I wash my face with CeraVe at night then just put this snail repair cream all over my face and that’s it. I use masks occasionally as sort of a detox of toxins, but otherwise, this little jar is my go-to for everything. Highly recommend trying it, especially for combination skin."" —Natalya Cappellini Get it from Amazon for $10.89+ (available in four sizes). Promising reviews: ""I’ve been searching for the holy grail of lip balms and THIS IS IT. Seriously. I’ve been on the hunt for years, using everything from fancy French balms to plain organic nut butters and have always needed to reapply hourly. This stuff is magic. Just the tiniest dot keeps my lips super soft and hydrated for hours, even through drinking and eating. The grapefruit smells great, but isn’t overwhelming. I’ll never go back to anything else."" —Spectacle ""TikTok made me buy and I am not mad. This is my go to lip gloss and I definitely plan on buying more. I also didn’t realize I have the Laneige sleep mask I got from an Ipsy bag and just like to say, this company's products are really good. One of my faves overall!!"" —Nadine Perez Get it from Amazon for $14.40 (available in four scents and in a set). Peach & Lily is a woman- and Asian-owned biz that specializes in cruelty-free, spa-quality K-beauty skincare. Promising review: ""Love this moisturizer so much! It’s definitely a holy grail in my routine now. It’s so cooling and refreshing and leaves my skin feeling so hydrated, soft and smooth without any greasy or heavy feeling or sticky residue. Great for the oily skin and acne prone folks!"" —Chloe W. Get it from Ulta or Peach & Lilly for $43. Promising review: ""Holy grail. I’ve been using this alongside the Glow Recipe Pink Juice moisturizer for a few weeks now and I’m honestly confused and baffled by how great my skin has been. I have very acne-prone, troubled skin but this last week and a half or so, I really didn’t even want to put on makeup because my skin is the best it’s been in years. Try this!!!!!!!!"" —Mary Get it from Amazon for $16+ (available in two sizes and three styles). Oh! Anddd reviewers say they use this as a step in their double cleansing routine. What the heck is that, you may ask? Well, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice — first with an oil-based cleanser, and then again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the gross stuff out of your pores. Promising reviews: ""This is my first time ordering an oil-based cleanser and I’m so glad I purchased this one. I originally saw this product on TikTok and wanted to see what the hype was all about. After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2–3 minutes, I could visibly see my white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin, however, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom and my scarring doesn’t look as deep! The cleanser has a light clean scent. Not super strong! I am currently pairing this cleanser with the Anua heartleaf soothing toner to achieve glass skin. #glassskinera"" —Myshel Cagle ""I can't live without this cleansing oil, it's magic in a bottle. This is the only thing that's been able to clear the sebaceous filaments on my nose after consistent use daily!! It also helps the milia/filaments under my eyes too! LOVE ITTTTT, WHO LET ME LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT DOUBLE CLEANSING AT NIGHT?"" —Sarah Coleman Get it from Amazon for $17.69. Soko Glam is an Asian- and family-owned biz! Promising review: ""This is my fourth bottle, and I don't think I'll be switching toner any time soon. It's an amazing toner and makeup remover all in one — super easy and convenient! I can tell this is a great product by the way my skin feels afterward: clean, light, and not dry at all. I swear by this toner!! You won't be disappointed, I promise."" —Lindsay Get it from Soko Glam for $25 or Amazon for $23.73.  Promising review: ""I have struggled with acne my entire life. I’ve gone to dermatologists, tried salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tazarotene, and nothing ever even reduced it. I struggled with a very basic form of acne on my forehead, and sometimes my chin, and I have sensitive skin so I decided to try something new. I thought I’d have to wait at least a month to see results but within four days everything started to disappear. All of my major acne has completely gone away, I only see little tiny spots here and there but they go away within a day. Nothing like what I used to get. I'm going to start using it on my back to see if it helps there too. 10/10 the best face wash I have ever encountered in my life."" —Jaiden Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""This was my first K-beauty makeup cleanser and it’s still one of my favorites. It takes off even sealed theater makeup instantly and moisturizes my skin, which tends to dry out under makeup. It does leave residue on your skin if you don’t wash it off thoroughly — I find I need warm water and a face cloth, you can’t just splash water On your face and call it done. I’ve also used Clean It Zero and other oil cleansers and none soothe my dry skin as much as this one does. Magic for dry skin."" —Deanna Get it from Amazon for $17. After mixing the powder and activator, just apply the mask on your face, and you'll start to feel it working instantly! Promising review: ""After years of trying different products on my sensitive, acne-prone, red, rough skin, I saw this mask and all of the positive reviews and thought 'what the hell, I'll give it a go.' Even after the first application, I was really impressed with the results. My rough skin is smoother, I have no additional breakouts and when I do wear makeup it actually blends into my skin. It also helps the deep wrinkles on my neck. I even got a compliment on my skin the other day — this NEVER happens. I use the mask twice per week. I'm on month two and I recommend it to anyone with problems with their skin. My only caution is that it smells kind of funky (who cares) and it's a little hard to remove. I only apply the mask when I'm going to shower and wash my hair. It's zombie life for me here on out!"" —Charlie B Get a box of eight masks from Amazon for $24.75+ (available in multipacks). Krave Beauty is a Korean woman-owned small biz that aims to make skincare easy and stress-free. Promising review: ""I struggled with oily, acne-prone skin and a damaged barrier since I was a teenager. But I've been loyal to this cleanser and the oat moisturizer since they came out and y'all...it took some time, but my skin is finally, FINALLY, in the place I always wanted it to be. It has the perfect texture, amount of lather, and after-feel of any cleanser I've ever tried. Do your skin a favor and try this."" —Monisa A. Get it from Krave Beauty for $16. Promising review: ""I've been buying this mask for a little over a year now and can verify that it is totally worth the hype. I have relatively dry skin, but while I never had acne when I was younger, I quit hormonal birth control a few years ago and since then have started breaking out shortly after ovulation. I tried many more expensive masks, but I also have very sensitive skin, and previous products either left me itchy and irritated or had no effect. This mask has completely cured all of my skin problems. If I remember to put it on the night I think I've ovulated, I have zero zits, and if I forget and some start to show up, I do the mask and the zits have significantly retreated by the next morning. I only need to use it a few times a month so it takes me several months to go through a jar. I would pay four times more for this product if I had to!"" —carof Check out our full review of Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask. Get it from Amazon for $9.88. Promising reviews: ""This is a really nice first step in my morning routine. It's helped minimize my hormonal acne because the PHAs gently exfoliate. I don't recommend using other acids with this. I like that it comes with little tweezers so you can pick up a pad in a sanitary way."" —Scrump ""When I tell you my skin hasn’t been this clear in forever. I have PCOS and hirsutism, which causes me to grow hair on my neck and chin. I’m also a skin picker so clearing my skin has been really difficult for me. But this product has saved my skin. I’m still working on my skin picking but when I don’t, these pads help to exfoliate and help with the dark marks. Thanks Anua!"" —Jessyca Renee Get it from Amazon for $23. Promising reviews: ""Just *chefs kiss*. I have textured/damaged skin due to acne and this product worked instantly for me. This left my face feeling sooo soft and smooth, I have never experienced this type of results from any product that I’ve used. I highly recommend this!!!"" —Carla ""Wait so three things. One, I never write reviews on Amazon. Two, I didn't realize how much I needed this until I gave it a try. Three, just use this for a week and you'll find yourself skipping visits to both your demonologist and the spa. There's something magical in this bottle — I'm convinced there's a genie in this bottle."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $22.50+ (available in two sizes). For persistent or bigger pimples, put a pimple patch on overnight for 2–3 days to help the pimple diminish. Promising reviews: ""This product works! It stays on until you remove it and honestly, you can wash your face and forget it’s there and still it holds up to a lather without falling off. I had a few hormonal acne areas on my chin that were painful to the touch. This patch seemed to alleviate the discomfort and I forgot about it and wore them overnight. It took a few days for the spot to go down in size but it works. As for blemishes after threading, single treatment and by morning…the blemish is gone."" —LaTisha Taylor ""Anti-acne sorcery in a patch! I put these on un-popped and pre-popped zits and either way the result is great. The skin heals and the zit shrinks!"" —phai Get a three pack of 24 patches each from Amazon for $9.26+ (available in four sizes). After cleansing your skin, apply this using your hands or a cotton pad (whichever you prefer) and wipe gently over your face. Don't forget to apply some SPF afterwards! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this. I'm halfway through my first bottle and I will be purchasing again. This has become a staple in my daily night routine. I've had very oily skin, large pores, acne and blackheads since I was a teenager and I'm now in my late 30s and still get hormonal flare-ups. Using this product has greatly improved my skin's appearance. It looks and feels healthier. My blackheads are gone and my pores have decreased in size. I still get oily throughout the day but it's better than it used to be. I'm definitely more confident about my skin now. 😁"" —Amanda Get it from Amazon for $24.69. After cleansing, soak your cotton pad with this stuff, gently wipe your face, and lightly tap for absorption. Follow up with moisturizer! Promising review: ""This stuff works! First off all there was no purging period, which my acne-prone skin is grateful for. It also doesn't sting or smell harsh. Within a week of using this toner I stopped having breakouts. My dark spots are slowly getting lighter and my skin is starting to glow. I'm on my second bottle now and I have nothing but good things to say. I really hope they never stop making this."" —kem Get it from Amazon for $14.20. Promising review: ""I am in love with this product. It doesn't have a smell and texture-wise it's more of a gel. It absorbs into the skin perfectly without drying down matte or greasy. It makes the skin look so healthy. After washing my face, my acne sometimes gets irritated, but as soon as I apply this moisturizer the irritation goes away. It's also really compatible with every toner, serum, sunscreen and essence I've used. It's my favorite product."" —Neyssa Get it from Amazon for $19.90+ (available in two sizes). Promising reviews: ""I HAD to write a review. I use this in the morning and night after my whole face routine and putting on moisturizer. I don't have dark bags however, my under-eyes do get a bit puffy and I was noticing fine lines. DUDE, those fine lines are fading. Last night I went to a party and woke up looking like the crypt keeper, and this stuff normalized my creepy zombie eyes in about 20 minutes. It's $9. Do yourself a favor and buy it."" —Jasmine Deatherage Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in two styles). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. Promising review: ""This is the first lip oil I've ever used. Usually I avoid anything with oil because I have very sensitive and generally oilier skin, but I wanted to give this a try because I wanted something sheer and pretty for a natural makeup look. Probably the best purchase I've ever made!!! It's super sheer and looks fine on its own without any other makeup. The smell is delicious, and while the gloss dries and fades after about an hour or two without eating, the color stays all day! I did have to reapply after eating, but not after drinking water! I just wish it was bigger, it's a teeny bottle. Would definitely buy again!!"" —Rachel Get it from Amazon for $11.99 (available in 14 shades). Promising review: ""I LOVE this cleansing balm. I’ve been trying all sorts of different cleansers to try and help my acne to no avail. It wasn’t until I started watching vids on Korean beauty that this oil cleanser kept being recommended and I decided to give it a try. Worth. Every. Penny. You don’t need a lot to wash your whole face, and it gets the job done well, leaving my face super refreshed afterward. Of course, I’ve been using other Korean beauty products so I won’t give it full credit, but I do think it’s helped out my acne a lot."" —A Flying Potato Get it from Amazon for $17.96+ (available in two styles and a multipack). This toner is vegan and cruelty-free. Promising review: ""I am in love with this rice toner. It might be one of the best toners I've ever tried. I feel like it made my pimples disappear and made my acne scars lighten. This might be one of the best Korean products I've ever tried as well. It doesn't have a weird scent and it looks a little bit like milk. I feel so refreshed after I use this toner and it makes my skin so shiny and plump. I feel very moisturized after using it. Anyone thinking of using a toner should try this one."" —Kayra Get it from Amazon for $18.70+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""Freakin' love this stuff. Makes my skin feel bouncy and hydrated. It feels like a beautiful drink of sunny morning water for the face. LOVE the smell of this stuff it’s a very bright citrusy scent I can’t describe fully that just smells like you are happy to be alive lol. Oh AND I looked up the ingredients of this stuff on the EWG website and it had pretty good safety ratings! After using this consecutively for a couple of weeks I’ve noticed a significant brightening affect and anti acne affect! I think this is due to the active ingredients being for skin barrier health so the skin is less likely to break out. And the evening of my skin tone is just an added benefit!"" —CatLover222 Get it from Amazon for $21.99. Promising review: ""I love this product with my heart and soul. I've been using it as a part of my skincare and prep routines for a few months, and my skin looks so natural, plump, even, and healthy. I'm ALL about a glowy, dewy, natural look and this product has helped me achieve that, plus it's a great serum packed with goodies that your skin will thank you for! It's definitely worth it. And I will always recommend this to anyone. I use it twice a day, in the morning as the last step before my makeup routine and at night before moisturizer! If using it during the daytime, don't forget to use sunscreen because its vitamin and natural acid contents make skin a little more susceptible and sensitive to sunlight! Hope this helps :)"" —Andrea Velarde Get it from Amazon for $20+ (available in two sizes). Each mask features a different kind of essence, such as green tea, aloe, or pearl, so they each target slightly different skin concerns. Promising reviews: ""My must have item. Helps with redness, scarring, uneven skin tone, dryness — it's pure magic. I use them every day. And there is usually some liquid at the bottom of the bag that I put on my legs and hiney to help with cellulite and spider veins. All time favorite skincare product so far. Love love love. I am broke as a joke which is why the $11 price tag is so beautiful."" —Katie ""These masks are an incredible bargain! They all have the same basic ingredients, which are excellent, and each mask has a different specific ingredient for skin smoothing, moisturizing, pigmentation...you name it! They are made in Korea and contain excellent ingredients. I slap one on for 20 minutes every morning after washing my face, before the rest of my routine. They are very moisturizing, and they’re absolutely dripping in serum."" —Daba Get a set of 16 from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in more multipacks and two styles). Promising reviews: ""Not gonna lie I was skeptical that this could help me. A few months ago I decided I could bleach my hair. I burnt it to such a crisp that I’ve literally been wearing it up under a cap. That worked when it was winter but now it’s warm so I needed a solution. I saw this product highly recommended on other sites and the reviews were good. So I ordered a tube. Used it twice now and OH. MY. LANTA. For months my hair has felt like crunchy noodles ready to snap at a moment's notice. After one treatment (left in about 15 minutes after shampoo, before conditioner) my ends feel soft!! After the second time washing with it, it actually moves like it’s not damaged and it is visibly SO much healthier. Like seriously idk how they bottled witchcraft but I’m going to continue to use this product even when my hair grows out. An absolute magical miracle potion! I seriously prepared myself to explain to the world that it doesn’t work. But instead, I have the healthiest hair I’ve had since being a home hairdresser. 10/10 for less then $10. Picture from left to right (blonde above): my hair before using this, my hair after first treatment, my hair after second treatment. —Beth Wow, dang, now I want this.

Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Yeah, these may be on the pricier side, but the stress-free trip you're about to take because of them is truly priceless. BuzzFeed Staff I am a notorious vehicle sleeper — planes, trains, cars, you name it, I'm asleep almost immediately. And while I can sleep almost anywhere, it's not exactly the most sound sleep since I frequently wake up from the typical head bob situation. I also often end up with neck pain from not having proper support. I just tested this out for the first time and it truly changed the game. I actually felt like my head was supported in a comfortable position. I had some of the best travel sleep I've ever had with this! This is definitely worth the splurge to ensure you get actual rest while traveling.  Promising review: ""This was suggested by someone who said that they slept well the first time they used this support. It worked for me. My first use was yesterday on a flight from LA to Boston. I slept well and not even good movies could interfere. I worried about the cost as it was much pricier than the horseshoe-shaped things that I have used off and on over the years. It is worth it. It packs small and is easy to put on. Great support."" —Ian Montgomery Get it from Amazon for $64.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I'm on my second 'carry-on' bag. The first was replaced under the lifetime warranty after more than seven years of flying almost weekly. The stronger and updated handle is a great improvement. The bag has always been nearly effortless to roll along. Extremely durable and worth the money."" —John P. Get it from Away for $275+ (available in 11 colors).  This comes with four different size suitcases —16-inch, 20-inch, 24-inch, and 28-inch — plus a cosmetic case. Promising review: ""The performance and quality of the suitcase is great! I’ve had this for about three months now and used it about four round trips since and it’s still in good condition and fits all the stuff that I need and want to bring on my trips. Definitely worth the money and I believe I’ll have this suitcase for a very long time! It has two zippers that meet together at the lock, that’s nice. And the wheels are great rolling over cracks and bumps in and around the airport and train stations."" —Nijiah M. Get the set from Amazon for $199.99+ (available in four sizes, five colors and single-piece options). Pond LA is a California-based woman-owned, Asian-owned independent product design studio that produces in small, handmade batches from fabrics sourced in Los Angeles. Promising review: ""I had a long flight planned and started seeing ads for this hoodie, it looked very comfortable so I decided to give it a try. I usually wear L or XL in hoodies/jackets and based on the reviews and sizing information, I sized down to a medium. This size was still way too big for me, especially the sleeves (I'm 5'9""). I easily returned that one and purchased a size small, which fits perfectly, maybe not as 'oversized' as it is supposed to, though. However, I love it, it is very soft and comfortable and I love using the hoodie to block the light (even with headphones on). It is pricey, but it will definitely be my go-to hoodie for long trips in the future!"" —Leire M.B. Get it from Pond LA for $128 (originally $128; available in women's sizes L–XXL and other colors here). I always get annoyed about the concept of wearing wired headphones that are stuck in my ears for a long flight. I knew the only way I was going to be even reasonably comfortable on my recent 8-hour trip was if I was wearing my over-the-ear headphones, but of course the problem with that is that they use Bluetooth. Thankfully, I've been writing about this product for awhile so I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to give it a try. It is honestly the perfect answer to being able to use your own Bluetooth headphones. It is worth the splurge to be able to use your own comfortable headphones and I would absolutely recommend these to anyone going on a long flight!! Promising review: ""I've used these many times now and am impressed both with sound quality and battery life from such a small package. They work great for those long plane rides and let you share the audio if you wish. I can also send audio to my car which doesn’t have Bluetooth but does accept an audio aux input. Pairing is easy and quick. The size is perfect for transportability. Well worth the money!!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $54.95+ (available in three variations and two colors). IDK if I just have incredibly sensitive ears or what but leaving earbuds in for more than an hour or two is always so uncomfortable for me. These are worth the splurge considering I can wear them for more than like 30 minutes without needing to give my ears a break. I decided to bring these along so I could actually watch movies or listen to music for a more substantial part of my flight. I had honestly forgotten about the noise-canceling feature, but when I first put them on on the plane I was shocked by how much of the airplane noises had almost completely disappeared!!  Promising reviews: ""Worth the money! Great headphones. Noise cancellation is wonderful and they don’t hurt your ears. Look good and the sound quality is great."" —Amazon Customer ""These are the perfect noise-canceling headphones for traveling. Their ability to be folded and put into a small case that takes up very little room is amazing! I loved the set I received, so I bought my husband these for Christmas and he loves them just as much. Not only are these headphones perfect for traveling, but also for school usage and zoom meetings. I have used mine daily for the last seven months and they have not faltered at all. My top favorite headphones I have ever owned, and the best Beats headphones out there."" —Taylor Get them from Amazon for $179.49+ (available in seven colors). It's recommended for kids ages 3–7 and fits most standard economy seats. Plus, it has an adjustable strap so you can carry it over your shoulder, a top handle, and a mattress inside that can be removed and used while in the flight. Parents have even used this product while in the airport waiting for the flight to keep their kids comfy and happy.  Promising reviews: ""Good quality, worth the money."" —Fran ""Traveling with a toddler is always a challenge but comfort is key and this little magic package makes the airport trip that much smoother. We can store small toys, pillow, and one throw blanket for our family of three. Great idea and great buy. We will be using this until it breaks."" —TifferTheTrend Get it from Amazon for $229 (available in six colors).  Cincha Travel is a California-based small business that specializes in adjustable travel belts made out of vegan leather. The brand donates 100 airline miles for each purchase, which are used to reconnect separated migrant families. You may even recognize this from Shark Tank! Promising reviews: ""Worked perfectly and made traveling a lot easier! Great idea. Well made and worth the cost!"" —Lucille ""I just returned from my first trip using my Cincha, and it was fantastic!  My backpack stayed on top of my roller bag instead of me carrying it, or falling off. And it was so easy to pop on and off the roller handle when I needed to. I highly recommend!"" —Cheryl Get it from Cincha Travel for $39.99+ (available in two sizes and 27 colors/patterns) or from Amazon for $39.99 (available in 16 colors/patterns). The essentials pack comes with two Mates, one Slim, and one Sticker. The Tile can also make a beeping sound until you find your items. Promising reviews: ""So helpful! Well worth the cost. Works great! Isn’t bulky and easy to set up."" —jo ""A must-have. I have these on everything, including my wallet, car, luggage, and dog. After being separated from my bag in another country and tracking it down, I swear by these things. Highly recommend."" —Izzy Castro Get the pack from Amazon for $79.88. The medium size fits pets weighing up to 10 pounds, and the large fits pets weighing up to 18 pounds — that said, some reviewers mentioned that the large size works perfectly well for their 20-plus-pound dogs. It can be wheeled using the telescoping handle, held using the strap, or worn as a backpack. Promising reviews: ""We loved this backpack for our pup. She is a French bulldog, 2-years-old, and she had enough space to do a full turn in it. Best feature is that I was able to pull her instead of carrying her cause my girl is heavy 😆, healthy heavy. Also, it has an opening on the top so she had her head out of the bag while we walked through the airport. I loved the bag and it's worth what we paid for it."" —Roberto Molina ""This is the best cat carrier I have ever found. I needed something for when I was flying. It fits under the seat in front of me, and it’s easy to pull because of the wheels. My cats can sit up and watch or they can lie down. I highly recommend."" —Jane Get it from Amazon for $59.95+ (available in two sizes and three colors).  Alleyoop is a woman-owned business that creates compact beauty products that typically have several functions. Promising reviews: ""This is one of my best travel buys. I like the sturdy feel but really like the conversion to different brushes. No searching, no extra space. Pricey, but worth it if you travel, have small space, or misplace items."" —Diana Hefter ""I absolutely love this travel makeup brush and sponge combo! It's so convenient for when I'm on the go and need to touch up my makeup. The bristles are soft and the sponge is great for blending. Plus, it's compact and fits perfectly in my purse. I highly recommend it!"" —Mary G. Murphy Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two versions). There are also four USB ports. It converts 220/240 V to 110/120 V. Promising review: ""Excellent and worth the cost. This product was genius and kept all my devices charged while visiting South Africa. My mom and I roomed together on a family holiday and her international charger didn't work. It had some manufacturer defects, so we were fortunate to be able to use my power supply. This power strip was cool because we could use our USB cords for phones, watches, mobile chargers, etc. The plug was only for the camera batteries or additional devices. A gem and never failed!"" —N. Husser Get it from Amazon for $33.98. P.S. It's also got a neck strap to keep it from slipping off of you during naps, and if you fold it inside out, it turns into a travel pillow! Is there anything they haven't thought of?!  Promising review: ""The Gravel travel blanket is lightweight, compact, and comfortable. I like that it can also be used as a pillow. The pockets for your feet and the snap for your neck are unique features. There are less-expensive travel blankets online, but I purchased the Gravel blanket because it has features and elements that the other blankets don’t have. The Gravel travel blanket is also easy to care for; just wash it in cold water and air dry. It air dries quickly too."" —Douglas M. Get it from Gravel for $99 (available in other colors here). When you rub it (on clean, dry skin), the solid melts into a silky, lightweight oil. Promising reviews: ""This is the only moisturizer you need if you’re trying to live a clean and waste-free lifestyle! The moisturizing bar will last forever and the container is multipurpose after its lifespan for more moisturizer, storing your reusable cotton pads, etc. I love it! It’s worth every penny and helps me live more sustainably."" —botanicalmami ""Love this moisturizer. This leaves my face feeling silky and smooth without feeling greasy. Perfectly balanced. And I love that I can take it traveling without worrying it will leak all over the place."" —Lynn A. Get it from Sephora or Kate McLeod for $68 (also available in a refill size).  My colleague Emma McAnaw owns this very bag and raves about it. Here's what she has to say: ""I use this every time I travel — and I never, I mean NEVER, check bags. I even took this with me to Amsterdam and easily packed about four sweaters, DOC MARTENS, and all my undies and toiletries. To be fair I wore the same pants for four days (I am cheap, guys), but I never felt like I needed more space. And yes — even Spirit lets me take this."" Check out Emma's full review in ""8 Things You Should Buy Because Your Closet Is Hungry"" (#2). Promising reviews: ""Love it so much! Easy to keep clean, the BEST to travel with, cannot say enough good things. Worth the money!"" —Emily L. ""I love this bag for travel. Size-wise it's acceptable as a carry on and I've even brought this bag with my roll aboard and had no problems on Alaska or American airlines. It's pushing the limits on your second personal item, but as long as you don't stuff it too full, you should be okay. This bag has pockets on all sides, a really nice shoe bag and a small zippered pouch that I keep my Lululemon travel shawl in. The grey neoprene is really nice and I get lots of compliments. It is prone to picking up dirt marks, so you need to be careful about putting it on the ground or shoving it anywhere that might be dirty."" —CdnNordyFan Get it from Nordstrom for $215 (available in three colors) or from Dagne Dover for $215 (available in five sizes, nine neoprene colors, and three air mesh colors). BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly has this and says, ""I snagged this backpack after hearing my colleague Chelsea Stuart sing its praises. I had a trusty (now discontinued) InCase backpack I used as a personal item and served me well on dozens of trips for about five years. But I wanted a bag for some upcoming travel (2.5 weeks in Europe with *just* carry-on for five flights) that opens up like a suitcase for easier packing. Since buying, I've taken it on two long weekend trips (Amtrak to Newport, RI, for a wedding and regional train to a CT country lake house) with no complaints. In fact, for both of those trips I packed MORE than I needed.  Inside, you'll find a mesh zippered pocket and a plastic pocket perfect for your toiletries. I can fit enough wet toilet toiletries in the second pocket as I'd be allowed to carry-on for a plane. In the mesh pocket I put other necessities like cotton swabs, medicine, eye glasses, etc. The main compartment is deceptively deep so you can easily roll clothes and Lego-fit them in together without using packing cubes. In fact, I fit all of the stuff in the second picture in that section (a romper, PJs, a bikini, sunscreen, five pairs of undies, a pair of jean shorts, nap dress, three pairs of socks, two pairs of sandals, two T-shirts, a slip skirt, sleep mask, curling iron, mini flat iron, makeup bag, and tote bag). AND it has stretchy X-straps to keep it all secure like you'd see in a roller suitcase so when I unzip it, everything stays put. But before I forget, there's a separate cushioned laptop pocket close to the backpack straps that I found works well for books or a Kindle if your travel leaves you laptop-less.  I love that this backpack has DEEP side pockets so your umbrella or water bottle won't fall out. In fact, I stuck a flashlight and an umbrella in one side pocket. (You could always use a flashlight.) Plus! It has a generously sized pocket on the front of the backpack with easy access for sunglasses, snacks, writing pens...all sorts of those little extras you need to access quickly. To top it all off, the backpack straps and top handle are STURDY. I felt totally secure toting it around and slinging it into overhead storage compartments on the trains. I love the look and construction of it with faux leather and sturdy black canvas, and the trolley passthrough to easily fit on my roller suitcase I'm about to drag through a bunch of airports. At nearly $88, this isn't the cheapest backpack option but if you're a frequent traveler, you'll get so much mileage on it and seriously save on some baggage fees, making it well worth the cost. This backpack and I are going places, for sure.""  Get it from Beis Travel for $88 (available in eight colors).  It can hold kids who weigh up to 55 pounds and only weighs 9.5 pounds. Promising review: ""This stroller is amazing! We have four boys — 8, 6, 4, and 2. We needed an extra single stroller to take to Disney and this was perfect. It folds up so tiny — it’s amazing really! We were able to fit it under our double stroller and just pull it out when one of the older kids needed a break! It even pushed my 8-year-old (60 lbs) smoothly. In fact — on the way home from Disney we checked the double stroller and just took this! We love that it fits inside the top luggage racks — it’s so nice not having to wait on the gate-checked items! My 2-year-old slept for 1.5 hours in it at Animal Kingdom — I was a little concerned he wouldn’t because the seat doesn’t recline but he didn’t seem to mind! I would say that sometimes it seems a little flimsy in the handles — but it’s obviously not, must just be the way the joints work so that it is able to fold down so small! Now that we’re home, I use this baby way more than I thought I would! It’s just so easy/quick/light! I’m not sure I would want this as my ONLY single stroller (we also have the city mini jogger) but it’s definitely awesome to have in our arsenal of strollers! It was worth the splurge!"" —Lane Vorbach Get it from Amazon for $149.99+ (available in four styles and four colors). That's right, it's both a hair straightener *and* a curling iron! And it has a carry-on bag. It can be used anywhere because it is dual-voltage! All you need is an adapter and you're good to go! Promising review: ""Honestly this little iron has surprised the heck outta me. Got it for a three week trip so I needed to minimize the weight in my suitcase. I really wasn’t thinking it would be as fantastic as it is. It is as good as my full size! It’s super lightweight and I love the dual feature of flat iron and curling iron. This is worth every penny!"" —hapamama Get it from Amazon for $59.94 (available in two colors). Even better, there's no batteries or electricity required so you can really make a cup anywhere. To make, add ground coffee to the filter basket with the help of the integrated scoop, apply slight pressure to level the grind, then add hot water into the water tank. Finally, unlock from its travel position and pump a few times to pressurize and extract perfect espresso. Promising reviews: ""This is absolutely worth your hard-earned dollars! I have a makeshift coffee shop in my office and I really wanted something that could add to it. I can honestly say I will be buying another for my friends and family who I know love coffee!"" —Kassandra Lee Castañeda ""This works so well for camping for a quick coffee craving! Took this camping over the weekend and used it a few times at the office. Depending on the grinds you use, it's good for a light single espresso shot or if you reuse the same grinds and purge three capfuls of water through the filter, you'll get a full cup of coffee. Works great without lugging a glass press around in your backpacking or camp gear! Easy to clean and store away with the retractable priming handle."" —SocKeTPupPet 🤖 Get it from Amazon for $54.90. Promising reviews: ""Worth the splurge. Barking dogs, traffic noise...may peace be with you! This magic orb drowns out any sound so you can stay totally unconscious and unfettered by the outside world. Sweet dreams, y'all."" —whatchoowillis ""I have searched high and low and tried so many sound machines to get that real fan noise. This one comes pretty damn close! The price hurt me a little but it is well worth it for this product if you must have a fan to sleep with! My husband and I and our two daughters all must have a fan (for the noise) to sleep with and the dust that collects on our fans was starting to cause allergies and is just gross to look at and hard to clean. Also, it can get a little cold, so this machine was perfect for us. I bought three and we all sleep great at night! Also it's really small so it's great to pack up in your bag to travel with! It's worth the money!"" —MommaJ Get it from Amazon for $79.99 (available in black or gray). The reviews used in this post have been edited for length and clarity."

It holds all my documents and IDs, and makes going through airports easy with everything right at hand. It's a good size and fit nicely in my cross-body travel bag. So, if you need a nice travel wallet, give this one a go. It's a good quality and price."" —khaleesi ""I only use this thing for travel. It's compact and lightweight, very comfortable for traveling."" —Carolina B. Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in 31 colors). If you're flying with this in your carry-on just make sure that you put it in an easy-to-access pocket because I've had security look for it in my bag after going through the X-ray.  Promising review: ""I'm getting ready to move, and the drive is going to take me a few days. I got this to feel more comfortable staying in hotels and motels. I feel really good about my security with this on the door. It was very easy to install, and it's super strong."" —Victoria Ciavarelli Get it from Amazon for $11.99. Promising review: ""I carried this pouch during a three-week cruise through Greece and Turkey. It was extremely comfortable, lightweight, and handy, allowing easy access to important papers and money. Love it!"" —JC Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in three colors). After putting this in MANY travel stories, I bought one for myself for a summer European vacation where I found myself at several beach clubs. It was perfect for keeping mine and my friend's belongings safe while we dozed in our beach chairs or swam in the sea. Plus, it's the perfect size to hold phones or wallets, and easily carry in your beach or tote bag. It's come in clutch in a few hotels and Airbnbs that didn't have working safes.  Promising review: ""Good for travel and holding passports in the car. Easy to use and convenient. I felt comfortable leaving our passports in the car during day trips in Canada."" —Nikki W. Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two colors). Check out a TikTok of the portable fan in action.  I own this and use it ALL the time. It comes in handy in a variety of situations at home *and* while traveling — especially when you're sitting in a stuffy plane in Miami in July with the doors open, waiting for the pilot to board and take off. I def got some jealous side-eyes from other passengers as I kept myself cool with this.  Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in four colors).  Promising review: ""It’s perfect to stay in the outer suitcase pocket. Pull it out for mealtime and slide it back in. It made the speedy airport meal at the gate so much more comfortable."" —Christen Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in various and patterns).  Waypoint Goods is a small biz that specializes in travel accessories.  Promising review: ""Traveled around India and Nepal and found this scarf to be indispensable. It did 'double-duty' as a warm and attractive wardrobe addition as well as a handy, hidden place to carry my passport and money. Wear it with the zipper low, keeping the weight of the contents at the bottom, and adjust the 'drape' to conceal the fact that anything is in there. It was comfortable and very handy to get into. Good looking and high quality. I was surprised at the level of quality, and the zipper and stitching stayed completely intact."" —avm Get it from Amazon for $14.95+ (available in eight styles). LOKI STASHED is a small biz specializing in these scrunchies. See them in action on TikTok here! Promising review: ""I use these every time I travel. Perfect for holding a key or some rolled-up bills for emergencies. Comfortable and reliable."" —Poke-me-in-the-coconut Get a pack of three from Amazon for $12.99 (available in six color combinations). JetBag is a small business specializing in creating bags to protect your wine and your stuff. It's designed with absorbent padding on the inside, so in the event that the bottle breaks, it won't get everywhere in your luggage.  Promising review: ""I love these bags. I frequently travel overseas and always want to bring olive oil, wine, or the like back from somewhere. These bags are perfect for protecting my finds, and I am comfortable that they will absorb the liquid if they do get broken. My husband actually put a bottle of cracked open wine in the bag to test it, laid the bag on its side, and it absorbed the liquid!"" —JHN Get a set of three from Amazon for $13.99 (available in three colors). Promising reviews: ""This is a bit bulky for clipping to the front. I could see the outline, and there was bulging while I was sitting. However, this was very secure and comfortable when clipped to the side. It is perfect for backup credit/ATM cards and extra cash. It's not very large, so it isn't a good option for people looking to carry passports. It was easy to forget about. In fact, I forgot I had it on while going through airport security and to be searched because it looked odd on the body scan...just something to be aware of. I apologized, explained what it was, asked permission to take it off...which was a little awkward but doable without baring anything. Still, overall, I'm quite happy with it. Never worried about it coming undone."" —Dalek Get it from Amazon for $18.95. My colleague Abby Kass used these on a trip: ""My mom and I both used these when we went to Paris in January 2020 and loved them. They're super convenient to use and since we visited in the winter, we actually kept them under our coats, so nobody (especially pickpockets) could see them. I like how nice the case and strap looked and that I could hold my phone out over the ledge of the Eiffel Tower ledge for an epic sunset shot, and not worry about it falling to its death. Plus, the attached wallet is perfect to stash a credit card, ID, and even a subway ticket. Can you see it chilling at my side in the right photo? Yep, that's where it was the entire trip and will be every other trip I take."" Promising review: ""The Bandolier is just slightly bigger than my iPhone 14 pro.....compact, lightweight, and comfortable to wear all day! My only displeasure is that the envelope-snapped pocket on the back is very tiny...it will only hold three thin items like credit cards, driver's license, OR cash. But I love the crossbody!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $98+ (available in six iPhone sizes and three color combinations). Not only does the backpack open from the inside, but it also has a phone pocket, document pocket, front zippered pocket, and an exterior side pocket. It's also made of nylon, so it's waterproof and has a strap to change it into a shoulder bag.  Promising review: ""I am in the midst of a month-long work/learning trip to Guatemala, and I am so glad I purchased this sturdy attractive backpack. It easily fits my laptop and books, and I feel at ease in crowded situations with the safety features of front zip pouches and sturdy cut-resistant straps. Comfortable to wear (I am 5'8"", and the adjustable straps are great. Great design, great product."" —ChicagoMo Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two sizes and eight colors). The bag has hidden, slash-proof, Chain Link construction and an adjustable, cable-reinforced, cut-proof shoulder strap. Plus, a locking zipper.  Promising review: ""Bought this bag last minute before my 1-month trip to Spain. It was such a lifesaver! There is so much pickpocketing in the cities, and there was no way anyone could do this. I held both of my teenagers' wallets, and I could even go to Hydro Flasks on the expandable sides. Love this, and we’ll take it with me every time I travel now."" —JLar ""Used this travel bag while on vacation in Europe. I wore it as a cross-body bag and felt secure. The zippers have locks, and passports, credit cards, and money are protected in the pouch that rests against the body instead of in front. Felt more secure than a passport/ money belt around my waist and way more comfortable. Both sides open up enough for a water bottle and small travel umbrella, leaving hands free."" —diane schoenhoft Get it from Amazon for $35.99+ (available in three colors). It also comes with a USB-C charging cable, travel pouch, keychain holder, quick-start guide, and a manual. Twelve South is a small business that has been creating innovative tech accessories since 2009.  Promising review: ""The earbuds supplied by airlines are uncomfortable, especially on long flights. These make listening to anything on the airplane super comfortable because you can use whatever headphone/earbud of choice that you are used to. In my case, my airpod pros. So glad I found this product!"" —Lingo Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in five styles). Perilogics is a small biz that specializes in tech-oriented travel products and backpacks. Promising review: ""Got this to make it more comfortable watching movies and reading books on my phone, while traveling. Used it on planes and a train. It takes a bit of getting used to, to know how to twist, squeeze, tilt, etc., to get it oriented how you want. And some arrangements will have the phone bouncing around a bit, which can be annoying. But I was always able to find an arrangement that held the phone well, at the right angle, without bouncing."" —Customer Get it from Amazon for $12.97 (available in five colors).  Promising review: ""I always disliked the neck pillows that I used to use while flying as didn’t help. The flexibility and ease of use is amazing and this not only helps my neck, but also lower back! I used it for an international flight and it made it much more comfortable. You can even use it alongside your back and the cover comes off to clean!"" —Fred Paisley  Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in six colors). Ciera Velarde, a former editor here at BuzzFeed, also loves this! She says: ""I've used this for the past few years and swear by it! Before this, I always found traditional neck pillows uncomfortable and would end up ditching them halfway through the flight and getting frustrated. The Trtl pillow is adjustable — you wrap the pillow around your neck and secure it with Velcro, and if you find it's too loose, just make it a bit tighter! I've truly never slept better on a plane than with this pillow.""  Promising review: ""I love this TRTL!! I first used it on a trip from Seattle to Buenos Aires and will now always use it. It made it possible for me to be comfortable on that long flight. I found it to be the best neck support in how it holds up my neck in a comfortable natural way. I love how I can use it on either side of my neck, and even in the front and back of my neck. I love how I can cover my face to just below my eyes if I want privacy. It is cozy, lightweight, durable and packs easily, or I can wrap it around my carry bag handle for quick transport. I bought one for a friend who took it on a Seattle to New York flight and she said it was a game changer for her as she was able to sleep for the first time while flying. Now I know that with my TRTL and Bose noise cancelling head phones, I can be cramped in a middle seat on a long flight and survive in relative comfort. Thank your TRTL!!! I just bought another one for a gift for my daughter. It is a well-designed product!"" —Amis Balcomb Get it from Amazon for $60.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""Plush thick pillow that holds your head comfortably during a flight. It fit great around my next and there’s a mechanism to adjust the fit to how you prefer. Super portable since it comes in a nice small bag you can fold it and store in. Highly recommend."" —L Caldwell Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five styles). These come with a wireless charging case that provides up to 14 hours of charge (with the earbuds able to play for four-plus hours with each full charge).  Promising review: ""The ear buds fit perfectly. I use them when I ride my motorcycle, workout, phone calls and when I travel. They have never fallen out of my ear. They are comfortable; I prefer them over my headset when I fly. The battery life is good for working out or a short ride. However, I take a spare headset for longer flights. I highly recommend these ear buds, especially if you've had issues finding comfortable a comfortable, affordable set."" —vdubzis Get it from Amazon $25.99+ (available in five colors). Check them out on TikTok here. BuzzFeed editor Emma Lord swears by these and raves: ""The moldable silicone of Mack's Earplugs contours easily to the shape of your ear to block out noise much more effectively than other foam or plastic varieties, and the noise reduction is so good that if I pair them with a white noise machine (or just like a white noise loop on Spotify) I genuinely don't hear noises from outside my room.  I've also *loved* these for traveling — if you put these babies in on a plane not only does it help reduce some of the YIKES factor when the plane takes off (it's loud!!), but it cancels out the murmuring noises of passengers on the flight and makes it easier to get some shuteye.""  Promising review: ""I've been purchasing Mack's earplugs for about eight years now as they help me sleep so much better at night (and are also super helpful on long plane trips). They're the best ones on the market and much larger with more comfort and coverage than ones in my local stores and pharmacies. Mack's are getting harder to find so I'm writing this in the hope that they stay in business."" —Amazon Customer  Get 12 pairs from Amazon for $12.99. The travel belt is adjustable to 38 inches to fit most bags. The belt itself is vegan leather with elastic accents and a quick-release buckle. Cincha Travel is a small business in California that develops adjustable travel belts made out of vegan leather. The brand donates 100 airline miles for each purchase, which are used to reconnect separated migrant families. Promising review: ""Rather than carry my bag on my arm or shoulder, this CINCHA offers a much more comfortable option. I move faster with this item! Highly recommended!"" —allegria8 Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in 16 colors). FYI, if you have Amazon Prime, you can give this a spin before you buy it! Promising reviews: ""This jumpsuit is cute and comfortable. I love it. It is very comfortable to wear on a road trip or for flying."" —B-More Mom & Luvin' It Get it from Amazon for $28.78+ (available in sizes S–3X and 32 colors/patterns).  Promising review: ""Lifesaver! Made a huge difference in my comfort level. Hard to blow up and use while cramped in a middle seat. Was well worth the effort and intrusion on aisle and window passengers."" —peace Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in four colors and also in a two-pack).  Promising review: ""We bought this for a flight from Atlanta to Paris. It worked great. One of the best things about it was that it can open up and be flat so if you have a window seat, you can lean it against the wall and over the arm rest to make it super comfortable to lean against the wall. On the other hand, if you have an aisle or dreaded middle seat, you can inflate and put it together for the support when leaning forward. Well worth it to get some good sleep on a longer plane flight!"" —Darth Wookiee Get it from Amazon for $24.99.  Check it out on TikTok.  Promising review: ""I have never missed taking this blanket on a trip and it has saved me from cold planes to hotels. It's soft, comfortable, and convenient. Easy to clean. Buying more!"" —Hayley Get it from Amazon for $29.95 (available in six colors). Check out a TikTok of the Airplane Pockets tray table cover in action.  Airplane Pockets is a small business that specializes in sanitary, portable travel organization products.  My colleague Emma Lord owns and loves this: ""I used this on a roundtrip from NYC to Tokyo, both with connecting flights in Canada, and cannot sing its praises enough. It fit all four of the different tray tables I used it on and was so ridiculously handy for keeping track of all my littler odds and ends like AirPods, the plane's headphones, earplugs, a sleep mask, a book, gum, a scrunchie, and little snacks. The hanging end of it easily tucked into the built-in sleeve of the seat in front of me for takeoff and when other passengers needed to scoot past me in my aisle seat. Usually, I feel like a hot mess and get frustrated rooting around in the grimy sleeve for my stuff, and this was such a refreshing solution! Several flight attendants even asked where I got it to buy one for themselves!"" Promising review: ""Out of all the travel accessories and/or items I have purchased to make traveling more comfortable this ranks up there as one of the best. The material is soft and not too thin or too thick for that matter. It stretched perfectly over the table without a lot of extra material hanging off the table yet it wasn't so tight that it looked like it would rip. When the table was up there was plenty of room in each of the pockets for my cell phone, gum, ear buds holder, and two tablets. I am so happy with this purchase and recommended it to all my family members."" —Mking110 Get it from Amazon for $29.99. Read more about compression socks for travel at Johns Hopkins and The Huffington Post. Promising review: ""These compression socks really helped me. No swelling of feet and legs on a flight from New York to Munich and onto Palermo. Amazing fit and not too thick. Really comfortable."" —L. M. Morabito Get them from Amazon for $14.32+ (available in unisex sizes S–XXL and in 17 colors). And check out our full Physix Gear compression socks review here. According to the instructions, you should take them at take-off and then every two hours and then again once you arrive to help with relaxation and combat sleepiness.  Promising review: ""I heard about this product from my cousin who used it for a trip Japan and it was very effective. I used it for a trip to Washington DC that had several stops and delays — total of 15 hours to get to my destination. I was comfortable upon arrival. The next morning I was ready for a work day."" —ELEANORE Get a pack of 32 pills from Amazon for $14.90. Promising review: ""These are snug enough to do the job; but comfortable enough that on a 5.5- hour flight I forgot I even had them on. I left them on 'til I got unpacked in the hotel, which totaled seven hours. They kept their shape and didn’t stretch out so I’ll get many uses out of them. I highly recommend them."" —T. Schneider Get a set of two from Amazon for $8.52. Promising review: ""Very comfortable, is not too tight on your head. I mostly use it when I have headaches and it helps to relieve the pressure. I now wear it to sleep and on long flights."" —Amazon Customer Get one from Amazon for $14.99.  Promising review: ""We bought this for a road trip with our little one, who is still rear facing — it was perfect! We knew the seat was warm from just driving around town and wanted to make sure it was comfortable for a long drive. It kept it cool, isn’t loud, and love that we could plug it in vs. only the battery. We use it regularly in town now, too."" —K Maddock Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""My kids need the room to be pretty dark to sleep. I didn’t have much faith in this, but needed to try something. These are AMAZING!! Absolutely worth every penny. Instantly darker and help keep the room at a comfortable temperature."" —Julie T Get it from Amazon for $31.76 (available in five designs). It comes with one handle and one blade refill! Promising review: ""This is the perfect travel razor. It is very compact and has a comfortable grip. I honestly like it better than my normal razors. The heads are interchangeable with the normal razor heads also, so you can reuse this as many times as you want. I love the case it comes in because of the drainage holes on the bottom."" —katie Get it from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: ""While traveling, this made my kid so comfortable to use the bathroom. It really did cover the entire toilet. Would buy again."" —mitra Get a pack of 24 covers from Amazon for $9.49. Shacke is a small biz specializing in travel gear and accessories. Promising review: ""I frankly don't like other people touching my personal clothing, and, as we know, TSA has the right to open your suitcase. Having my clothing confined makes me feel more comfortable when I arrive at my destination. In addition, if you're staying in a hotel or timeshare for a week or more, you can simply remove the cubes and place them in drawers. If you don't like living out of a suitcase while on vacation, this is the only way to go."" —Lee Get them from Amazon for $19.99 (available in eight colors). I wear a size L/XL in clothing and sometimes waist bags just don't work out so well for me. With this one, I can confirm that it fit around my waist comfortably without outerwear, across my chest without outerwear, *and* over a thick coat and several layers. The pockets inside are so handy and I even had room to spare throughout my Iceland trip. This was the only purse I brought for the whole trip and it performed its job flawlessly. Just make sure that you zip the zipper ALL the way because the zipper goes down pretty far on the sides for easier access to contents. Having my hands free was wildly convenient for a number of reasons, including crawling around inside of an ice cave and putting out my hands for some extra balance while walking on sheets of ice along cliffs. Oh, and it comes in so so SO many colors.  Promising review: ""I got this for our honeymoon for traveling overseas. It is the perfect size and fits a lot of the essentials! This fanny pack is sleek and very comfortable. It matches anything, and I can wear it for any occasion! Highly recommend!"" —Alison H. Get it from Amazon for $18.98 (available in 43 styles).  Promising review: ""Does the job you would want it to do. It also detaches if you need to hand your card to a waiter/waitress which is very convenient. The lanyard is a very comfortable material too."" —Amazon Customer Get them from Amazon for $10.99 (available in 15 designs). Promising review: ""Necessary product for comfortable cruise! Only one outlet in the ship cabin, was very useful."" —Keith D Bolling Get it from Amazon for $18.99. Promising review: ""I bought these for our recent cruise after seeing a recommendation. I’m glad we did. I felt much more comfortable about our bags making it to our cabin using these protectors (a co-worker recently had her bags not show up, possibly because her paper tags got ripped off in transit). I like that they come with metal cables to attach to my bags and the plastic covers are very solid with metal rings that won’t rip."" —Richard Woolf Get four from Amazon for $12.99.  Promising review: ""I get motion sickness very easily. I wear an electric pulse band, which is great but at night it makes it hard to sleep. I decided to use the earplugs at night and it seemed to really help. They were comfortable and I could sleep with them in without issue. I still had some motion issues, but our cabin was right at the front of the ship. Don't do that!"" —S. Beck Get them from Amazon for $17.99. Promising review: ""This is my second pair of water socks. I had to order another because they are comfortable and easy to pack while traveling. I learned from the first pair — order a size larger to get a better fit."" —Amy  Get it from Amazon for $8.68+ (available in seven sizes and 44 colors). Cliganic is a small biz specializing in health and wellness products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action.  Promising review: ""Kept the mosquitos away! Used for a two-day camping trip by a river in Oregon and did not get bit once! I have large wrists and ankles, but it fit well and was secure, but still very soft and comfortable. I could barely smell them."" —Erin Schumacher Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $8.49.  Promising review: ""Bought this outfit for my Caribbean cruise. Loved it! Cute and comfy. Received several compliments."" —Karen Get it from Amazon for $45.99 (available in sizes S–XXL and 26 colors). Promising review: ""These bottles work excellently when traveling internationally. Airline stewardesses were happy to fill them on the planes. While in Africa, we had an excellent way of carrying water. They are much more comfortable to carry than a bottle of water. They are cheaper to fill than buying bottled water. Zero complaints."" —Ski Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in 20 colors).  Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity. "

Promising review: ""Bought for my husband for Valentine’s Day, and he loves it! Perfect gift for a movie buff! Now we are watching our way through the list using a random number generator, and it solves the 'what should we watch' issue we always run into. Lol. The only thing I would suggest would be to use a paper towel and a little soap to rub it off, as using a coin puts indents in the poster."" —Leena R.

Promising review: ""Got this kit for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he's made a batch so far. He loved the idea of making his own beer and loved going through the fermenting process. The directions were easy to follow, but the process takes up to a month to complete. After the beer reached maturity, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the beer tastes and how smooth it was! This is a perfect gift for Father's day or a birthday. CHEERS! —Rita J Get it from Amazon for $37.02+ (available in three different kits and two sizes). Created by Nature is a small business!

Promising review: ""My husband always puts screws in his mouth, and I can't stand it, so I bought this for him for Christmas, and he used it for a project where he had to hold little screws, and it worked perfectly! Ever done a project where you dropped a screw and can’t find it or it fell down a crack and have to figure out how to get it out? We most definitely have. I am excited that that will be no more! My husband was impressed with the magnetic strength and the side pocket. Worked like a charm."" —JandD Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (also available in a pack of two).  And grab some fuel or isopropyl alcohol to light this bad boy up!

I strongly suggest getting the recommended fuel for the best experience."" —Leo Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in two styles and four colors). Promising review: ""This is a great gift for any basketball fan. The quality is amazing, and the price is great. So many pictures of Kobe and other basketball players of his era.

Recently, I found this cellphone telephoto lens kit, and was very happy with the purchase. The lenses are very easy to install — basically, you just screw the lens on the clip and attach it to the cellphone, no extra tool needed. It's very sturdy. I've tried the telephoto lens and the macro lens, and I'm pretty happy with the results. The images are clear, and the macro lens can show details."" —Alicia ""Was absolutely THE gift of the evening.

My husband is a contractor so he has all the tools but it is perfect to have in the house when I ask him to hang a shelf, a picture, or whatever. It has lots of handy tools inside, my husband was impressed with the quality of each tool and the variety. Plus he feels cool holding Thor's hammer, haha."" —Monica Aldrich ""My husband is extremely difficult to buy for. I end up trying to buy him functional funny stuff. This was actually well made and he thought it was pretty clever. He drags it out when someone needs help. Gets a good giggle."" —Tatorie79 Get it from Amazon for $99.99 (available in two colors). Promising review: ""It seems I have a tradition of buying my husband bottle openers for our anniversary. I bought this because I thought it was fun (and we are rewatching the MCU, so fitting).

Great gift! —Krista Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a 2-pack and in two colors). Promising reviews: ""Had my dad cackling!

This is a partyyyyy if I've ever seen one. Use it as a little coffee table when you're just kickin' it on the balcony, and when it's five o'clock, and you've got company, pop this baby's top, fill it with ice, and enjoy a nice cold bevyyyyy. It also has a drainage hole! Promising review: ""These perfectly match our espresso brown wicker patio furniture and make perfect end tables. The top has to be all the way up to turn the lock in place. (Tip: Add ice *after* beverages.) About one bag of ice fits over drinks. We leave the tops down, which impressively keeps drinks cold for 4–6 hours on an 80-degree afternoon in part/full sun. Beverage ring marks wash off easily, and there's a plug inside to aid draining. (We've left it unplugged, and cans were still cold and not as wet from melted ice, which is nice.)"" —A. Schottmuller Get it from Amazon for $79.15+ (available in two colors). Promising review: ""I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He uses chopsticks to eat things other than Chinese, so I thought these would be a good stocking stuffer. He was thrilled when he opened them, and he and my brother-in-law immediately started fighting with them like they were Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. He also loved the color options. Huge hit at our house."" —Tracie Gutknecht Get them from Amazon for $11.97. Promising review: ""A great thermometer. I can even see ambient temperature with it. The sharp point goes in easily and seeing the accurate temp fast can't be beat. You can even clip it to your shirt and with the ring, I actually have it hanging in a conspicuous place in my kitchen so I don't have to keep diving into the utensil drawer. It sure exceeded my expectations."" —B.C. Poppe Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in a 2-pack).  Promising review: ""The best thing for traveling ever!!

I tried many different models to connect the system to my Bluetooth headsets until I came across this one, and it is amazing! It seamlessly connects to my headset, very clear and reliable audio, and it takes the stress away from having to carry a number of headsets! Thank you!!!"" —Ryan Malloy Get it from Amazon for $54.95.

Promising review: ""I threw these in my bag last minute for a trip to a resort in Cancun, and we absolutely loved them! They take up no room, and I easily fit two pillows in my carry-on bag to have for the beach. Made the beach chairs so much more relaxing by being able to be comfortable. They blew up so easily. It just took four big breaths for each pillow. Loved that I could either use the straps or sand to hold them in place. I also liked the idea of traveling with them in my carry-on in case we had a delayed flight, and I had enough time for an airport nap. I'll be bringing these on all future vacations."" —Nikki Miller Get it from Amazon for $35 (available in seven colors). Promising review: ""I bought this after I saw a video on TikTok, so I had an idea about the yummy waffles I could make. First waffles were stuffed with apple pie filling. Second ones scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese. Just amazing!!! The only way you could make this better is to send a chef!! I definitely recommend watching a video on TikTok or YouTube to inspire you before you start!!"" —Adirondackdarling Get it from Amazon for $49.99.  Promising review: ""You can literally cook with a little butter and wipe to clean. Lightweight, which is important to me, and I have put it in the dishwater many times without any issue."" —Lauren Madeira Get it from our Goodful line on Amazon for $23.44. Promising review: ""Wow, just wow. Surfing with this has made a huge difference!!! I use this on my 2014 Moomba Mobius LSV. I now fill both the rear bags even to 900 lbs. each on both sides and this thing throws a clean long wave to whichever side its not mounted to. I don't have to list the boat anymore, making it much easier to drive and so much faster to switch riders from different sides. It looks the exact same as the picture shows, and it floats. I've never had it fall off during surfing and even forgot to remove it once and came up to speed 20+ mph before I realized it was still on and it never came loose. It floats so if you accidentally drop it while mounting it you don't have to worry about it sinking to the bottom of the lake. I wish I had bought long ago!"" —Joel Get it from Amazon for $229. Promising review: ""We have had our vehicles stolen a couple of times from our apartment building. Woke up one day to go to work, and the truck and trailer were gone. Called the cops who couldn’t do much at the time. We hopped in our family vehicle and followed where the AirTag said it was located. After about an hour, we tracked down and recovered all our stuff. We would have never found anything without these."" —Kimberly Bishop Get a pack of four from Amazon for $78.99. Promising review: ""Are you at the big game for the snacks?

Perfect to relax and decompress after a long day or when extra stressed. We haven't used it long enough to see changes in sleep or dark circles yet (which would be an added bonus), however even without those results this is an amazing eye rub with just the right amount of pressure that gives you instant relief for sore tired eyes. Easy to use and adjust to different head sizes."" —Kimberly A. Get it from Amazon for $69.99 (available in three colors). Glare Guard is a small business based in Easton, Pennsylvania creating polarized visors for glare-free driving. Promising review: ""This extender is great; I wish I had purchased this years ago. My daily commute to work is due east and the sun is directly in my line of sight. My commute home is just the opposite, due west and the sun is blinding. This extender is not only a great buy, but it also increases the safety of daily driving."" —Dyann Curtis Get it from Amazon for $34.99.  Promising review: ""I dropped a fresh pepper with all of its ooey gooey marinade DIRECTLY onto the apron. Not only did the stain come out really easily, I was really surprised that none of the marinade had seeped through onto my shirt. Honestly I thought this was gonna be a look-good-till-I-ruin-it kind of purchase. I'm pretty pleased. Also, it's not just brown, it's a nice unique mustard color that looks good next to my wooden spoons. I'm pretty tall and it covers the thigh spill zone too."" —Keeka Get it from Amazon for $28.99+ (available in six colors). Promising review: ""This is going to make my life in the garage so much easier and save me from countless hours of searching around for little items all over the shop. Now all the little items are all in their own drawer and nicely labeled. I use it for things like nuts, bolts, markers, washers, spacers, small tools, wire nuts, drill bits, taps, air compressor fittings and tire pressure gauges. i will be ordered another one or two to fill up with a full Drill bit index and tap set to hang next to my drill press. This is a fantastic little storage unit. better than cheap ones i have owned in the past."" —corey Get it from Amazon for $38.99+ (available in three sizes and colors). Promising review: ""Out of all the ways to keeps my hats easily accessible this is by far my favorite! Easy to put up and take down if need to, hold so many hats and is very sturdy! Just screw in the two screws and hook the black dome on and it’s ready to go! Hats don’t move much and the bills just hook together to stack nice and neat."" —Andrew Shelton Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in two colors and in packs of two). Promising review: ""I have to admit, my expectations weren't very high. I thought it was more of a joke when my husband got this for me for Christmas. Little did I realize, it would be one of my favorite gadgets ever! I don't know if I realized just how many things went missing in my seat gap. It has really saved a lot of things from disappearing into that black hole. It was easy enough to fit into my car and it's soft! It's just like an extension of my seat, except it fits every curve of my seat! There really isn't another product that compares to this. That's why I gave it five stars!"" —Tessa Forbes Get it from Amazon for $24.99. Promising review: ""This is an excellent device that makes your house keyless and safe. My only negative comment is that it is a surface mounted device that would be EASY to remove and walk away with it. I added an escutcheon that surrounds the keypad that makes it a big deal to remove. Now we have a keyless, safe house."" —wood-pro Get it from Amazon for $59.99. Promising review: ""I'm so glad I finally decided to buy these. They really are very comfortable, nice to sleep on, the gel is cooling, and I get good sleep! I would definitely buy these again!"" —Mary N. Get it from Amazon for $38.99. Promising review: ""This is a beautiful hardcover cookbook with so many yummy Disney recipes from the parks! There is a lot of Disney foodie history in it, plus recipes that look easy to follow with high quality ingredients. There are fun maps of each of the parks inside where the food is located from, which makes it fun. As an avid Disney fan I have never seen a cookbook like this. I highly recommend this cookbook for any Disney fan, whether they cook or not! It would even make a beautiful decoration in a kitchen."" —Nicole Get it from Amazon for $13.57. The motion sensor will turn the bowl light on when you enter the room and the light sensor will turn it off whenever the lights are on in the bathroom. It has 16 different colors, so feel free to adjust it with your decor!  Promising review: ""This is calming, creepy, soothing, eerie, beautiful, functional, and needed. It’s strangely satisfying to enter the bathroom in the dead of night and see the brilliant blue light glowing from between the lid and the seat. And to lift the lid and be greeted by a welcoming portal of soft brilliant light to guide you to your intended target; magic."" —Crypticmood Get it from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in packs of two and three). ""Thank You for the music."" —Your dad, and also Abba Promising review: ""These new Bose headphones are seriously impressive! The noise cancellation is like wearing your own little bubble of peace – whether you're in a noisy office or plane. And the battery life? It's insane! I've used them for hours without needing to charge, which is awesome for traveling. But let's keep it simple: the sound quality rocks. It's clear, it's crisp, and it's just plain awesome. Plus, they're super comfy to wear for long periods, which is a big plus! Overall, if you want headphones that make the world quieter and keep going forever, these headphones are totally worth it, 10/10."" —Stephen Gangemi Get them from Amazon for $249 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I did a lot of research on coffee makers before deciding on this one. The delayed brew feature is very easy to program. I like that you can set the warmer plate to stay on for two to four hours, which I especially like on the weekend. The removable water reservoir is very convenient. It is also very environmentally friendly with a reusable filter. I have only used the classic brew setting and the coffee has a great flavor. The coffee is very hot, which is very helpful when I am using a travel mug on the go. I would definitely recommend this coffee maker."" —Donna K. Get it from Amazon for $120.73. Promising review: ""I've had several massage mats, and this one is great. It has a nice, comfortable, soft foam pillow feel, so you don't feel like you're sitting on the massage motors. And it's so quiet, you hardly hear it, yet the massagers are quite powerful. I highly recommend this one."" —TJ Ferrara Get it from Amazon for $79.98. PhoneSoap is designed to sanitize their phone via UV light in 10 minutes and also serves as a charger. Promising review: ""I bought this during the pandemic. It's a bit expensive compared to the no-name brands, but you get your money's worth. It has UV lights on both the inside bottom and inside lid, meaning you don't have to flip the phone or credit card over to do the other side: it disinfects both sides of the item at once."" —Planethopper Get it from Amazon for $79.95 (available in five colors). This includes a four-piece fly rod, line, backing and leader, a rod case, rod box, 12 flies, a spare leader, zinger, nipper, and a carrying case.  Promising review: ""This is an awesome fly rod combo for the money. You get a nice four piece carbon long pole, rod bag, rod case, fly box with flies, line cutter, fly line, line backing and leader. The rod feels really good, it has a nice flex to it as well. The reel feels good and the bearings are smooth. I highly recommend this combo if your looking for a nice fly rod combo without wanting to spend too much money. Heading out to go fishing now!!"" —GoldLeaderFPV Get it from Amazon for $85.99+ (available in four styles). Promising review: ""This is so realistic. It was bought for a joke but it is super cute. It looks like a real chicken nugget. It’s great quality and well made."" —Brittany Jones Get a three-pack from Amazon for $10.99 (available in multiple styles and packs). Promising review: ""I bought three as gifts for our mothers. Great way to stay in touch and give weekly updated pictures of the great-grandkids. The app is easy to use and can upload pics to multiple frames at the same time. Multiple people can be friends with the frame to have multiple family members uploading pics. You can add comments for the pics that the frame displays. The frame even shows who uploaded the pic. Each frame can hold a TON of pictures, 1,000 so far and still plenty of memory available. Easy setup and once set up, the frame is user friendly (even for the older generation)."" —Dawn t Get it from Amazon for $54.99+ (available in four styles).

If you're over the amount of whelm in the air right now, this is the post for you. BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: “I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue. Since my bathroom color scheme isn't on the blue spectrum, this is problematic. The well water also causes the shower glass to film up quickly. I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed till my arms ached, trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess. My ambition in life is NOT to be a full-time bathroom scrubber! I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's TikTok (sorry, I don't remember which one) and thought, 'What the heck, might as well give it a try.' Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower, I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning, there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue, and the glass looked clearer, too. On day two, I sprayed again and walked away. The next morning, the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile, and the glass looked amazing. On day three, I sprayed the remaining spots, and the next morning, the shower practically looked new. NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner. The ONLY con I have is that it makes me sneeze while spraying from inside the shower, but I can live with that.” —L. J. Petillo Get it from Amazon for $20.98+ (available in two sizes and a pack of two). Promising review: ""These are the only dryer balls I've found that actually made me not need fabric softener sheets. It cuts down on static and I don't find pet fur clinging to my clothes when I pull them out of the dryer."" —Tianhui Fan Get them from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in five styles). Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many nipple covers over the years, and these are just in a league of their own! They stick and don’t move (sweat, clothes, moisturizer, etc. — nothing budges them), but then they peel off so easily. It’s magic. They are completely seamless, and my husband (without prompting) said they looked like a second skin. I’ve got quite 'triangular' boobs, and they completely mold to the shape and look like I just have no nipples lol. Only when I’m suuuuuper cold does any level of nipple start to show through, and even then, it’s minimal. They’re more pricey than others I’ve bought before but so worth it. The others were one and done — these have held up through multiple wears and are still in perfect condition. Will repurchase them as soon as they wear out, without a doubt! No more bras!"" —Alison BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Get a set from Amazon for $18.08+ (available in five shades and two sizes: one that fits cups A–C and one that fits cups D+). Promising review: ""I actually got this because my mom bought it and loved it. She has pretty severe arthritis, and this little contraption makes food prep a breeze for her, so I decided to try it. Well, holy cow! It does everything it says it's going to do! it's really easy to use. It's super helpful, really convenient, very easy to clean up, and stores pretty compactly (but honestly, it's already just living on our counter). Worth every penny!"" —A. Hendrix Get it from Amazon for $27.19+ (available in five colors and two styles). Promising reviews: ""I have never seen my sink so clean! It removed the limescale with a regular wash cloth and a little scrubbing."" —Cndrla ""I need this in bulk!! I have tried so many cleaning solutions to get out hard cooking stains on my stove top, and nothing worked! This stuff took it right out without a problem!!"" —Micaela Gunderson Get it from Amazon for $5.29. Promising review: ""This is one of those items you didn’t know you needed, and once you get it, you can’t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for multiple shower curtains. I know you’re like, ‘It’s just shower curtain hooks.’ And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto."" —Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.49+ (available in 13 colors). Promising review: ""Living alone, it is impossible to lotion your own back. This tool is perfect. It works very well to distribute the lotion all over and is easy to clean. Absolutely love it!"" —Kathi Get it from Amazon for $24.44. Promising review: “I had no idea that cleaning a Keurig was a thing. I bought these because I saw them on TikTok, believe it or not. I wanted to give it a go because my Keurig isn’t that old, and I didn’t think it would do anything. IT WORKS SO WELL! My Keurig wasn’t as nasty as some I’ve seen, luckily. I would highly recommend. Keeps everything running correctly and clean.” —Lauren Get a six-pack from Amazon for $9.95. Use this two to three times per week after shampooing your hair, and remember not to use it on your scalp. This treatment is just for the length of your hair. Promising review: ""I don’t usually do reviews on products, but for this one I absolutely have to. I have 3c-type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me I didn’t take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would've thought this brand would work on my hair. I have always used ethnic hair products and stayed away from brands such as this one. I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen. Thank you so much!! ♥️"" —Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $10.97. Promising review: ""Wow! First of all, I was shocked when I noticed that my toilet tank was so filthy. I never looked in there, but there was a reason that my toilet bowl needed to be scrubbed every day. The tank was so nasty I couldn't even see the bottom. I really didn't want to drain the water and scrub the tank, then I saw this. I honestly didn't expect that it would actually work since my tank was so nasty. I dumped this little miracle product in the tank and left it overnight, and the next morning, I saw a much cleaner tank. I can actually see in there now. No draining or scrubbing. Amazing stuff!"" —Linda Baker Get it from Amazon for $7.27. Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what writer Emma Lord has to say: ""I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.""  Promising review: ""I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth — it definitely gets between the teeth and also more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft, but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!"" —Jason A. Get a pair from Mouthwatchers on Amazon for $9.90 (also available as a four-pack).  Promising review: ""These are simply awesome! Such a small thing can make such a big difference. At night, when I opened my eyes, I was flooded by little dots of light intruding my space from all my electronics: the TV and cable receiver, the modem, the routers, the electric blanket control switch, the microwave, the smoke alarms, cell phones, etc. And it doesn’t take much to interfere with a good night's sleep. These will mute and soften those bright lights so they don’t bother you anymore. Thanks for a great 'little size, big results' product!"" —Ziapetlady Get it from Amazon for $4.39. Promising review: ""I will never use another product to soften earwax. Works like a charm the first time. I put 10 drops in and left them in for 10 minutes. Then I used a water bottle that you spray in the ear to remove the wax, and it worked very well!"" —Ciara IVP Get it from Amazon for $5.98. Promising review: ""I am a bit of a neat freak. These have been soooo useful for cleaning my baseboards, blinds, and fans. They can be used on really any surface, but they are specifically good in those spots. They can be submerged in warm, soapy water and reused over and over again. They are comparable to the Scrub Daddy damp dusters. There are a bunch of them in the box, and they are all individually wrapped. A great deal and a great product!"" —Bryn Get them from Amazon for $9.99 (available in six color combinations and three pack sizes). Promising review: ""I have a history with dry, very cracked, crocodile-like (lol!) heels. My heels were so hard and cracked that they would cause tears in my sheets and socks. I have tried [a million] products. All of them worked for like a hot minute. This though. This has CHANGED my feet!!! I went through a regimen of applying it daily after a shower and putting socks on. The texture of my feet gradually got smoother and smoother, and now they feel and look like normal feet!!!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $6.47. Promising review: ""After some shoes killed my feet after walking all day in Europe, this foot mask saved the day. It felt AMAZING on my feet and helped me recover a lot faster than just taking ibuprofen. Don’t travel abroad without this!"" —Maria Get it from Amazon for $14.67. Nori is a woman-owned small business based in Connecticut, hoping to make your life easier with this all-in-one travel iron and steamer. Promising review: ""It has a very sleek design and is lightweight. As someone who lives in an apartment with limited space, I think this compact iron (and steamer!) is a total game-changer. Its simple controls make it very easy to use, and the adjustable temperature settings cater to different fabrics, ensuring that your clothes are treated with the care they deserve. My favorite thing about the product is that it can be used on the go, making ironing quick and convenient anywhere. This is my new go-to for traveling. I highly recommend this product to anyone who values convenience, ease of use, and portability."" —John F Kemmerer Get it from Nori on Amazon for $119 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""Literally for any new or old Mac user, or even a user that’s used to any device other than Apple! Super helpful for how to copy and paste and do other minor tasks! I mainly use the mouse pad on the laptop, so as my hands rub or grace over the sticker, it has never come off or ripped off at any point in time. It is perfectly still down to the computer part, and I’ve had this for over a year now!! 10/10 recommend!🩷"" —Reyn Get it from Amazon for $5.95 (available in eight styles). Promising review: ""The only reason I'm giving the Folex 5 stars is because there's no place to give it 10. My dog, Sweetie, while playing on the tan carpeting in the family room, got hold of a blue Pilot G2 pen and chewed through the outer casing and the ink cartridge, leaving an approximately 6x12-inch area of carpeting splotched with blue ink. It took four or five applications, but following the label instructions to the letter, the spot was totally removed. Way to go, Folex. Outstanding!"" —Bob Get it from Amazon for $6.65. Lovoir Beauty is a small biz based in New Zealand! Promising review: ""I don’t wear makeup because I pretty much don’t know how to. I thought I’d give this a go because I have no skills and can’t do a cat-eye to save my life. But I was able to do this on the first try! I really thought it was going to take a while to get the hang of things, but it didn’t! Truly amazing, and it stays on all day and comes off easily! Love, love, love!"" —Ilana Get it from Lovoir Beauty on Amazon for $14.98+ (available in three sizes). Have coilier hair? This paddle brush might work better for you! Promising review: ""I have a headful of thick, wavy, shoulder-length hair. I sometimes wear it curly, but when I want it smooth, this tool is a huge time saver. I used to have to section my hair and spend a half hour or more flat ironing it. I still section it a little, but I can go from a big mop of mess to a sleek flip in very little time. I just spritz my hair and go to work. I have arthritis, and it is a big bonus that the handle is big, so I don't have to use a pinch grip to hold it. I also have shoulder pain, and the less time I can spend with my arms over my head, the better. This tool is worth every penny."" —Anonymous Get it from Amazon for $40.45+ (available in three colors). It also self-propels so you just need to steer, no hard pushing! Promising review: ""I confess I can be a lackadaisical housekeeper, which is problematic since my new dog sheds enough in a week for me to build an entirely new dog. What's worse is that vacuuming doesn't pick up much of his fur. This Tineco is magic, though. Not only does it pick everything up (dust, fur, hair, crumbs, Nature's Miracle, errant Cheerios), but because the wheels are motorized, vacuuming/mopping is a breeze. I get exhausted using my canister vac, but this thing is a blast to use. Here is what I've learned: I always use the 'extra water' feature, which seems to work better. I clean the dirty water holder and parts every time I empty it, and I run the self-clean cycle after every second emptying session. This means I can do my primary bath and my 10-foot by 12-foot TV room before self-cleaning and recharging for a little bit. Or I can do my kitchen, entryway, and hall before self-cleaning, or my living room. In other words, you're not going to do your whole house on one battery charge or without running the self-cleaning feature several times. Of course, the reason you have to run the self-cleaning so often is because this little beauty is picking up So. Much. Stuff. It's magic. If it broke tomorrow (and I don't think it will break for a very long time), I would buy another."" —Tsippi Get it from Amazon for $209. Promising review: ""I bought these because I have limited closet space. The ability to hang 20 pairs of leggings saves me tons of room. I also like the clips that hold the leggings; they do not leave marks on the waistband!"" —Sarah Get them from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two colors and three pack sizes). StirMate is a small biz! Promising review: ""I enjoy soups and puddings but hate to stand at the stove for 30 minutes or whatever making sure the milk doesn't burn. The StirMate solved my problem. I would recommend this item to everyone who cooks; what a great help in the kitchen."" —Mary J Get it from StirMate on Amazon for $73.65. Fellow BuzzFeed writer Jenae Sitzes is a fan of these sponges: ""I picked up this color removal sponge from Amazon after hearing about this hack on TikTok and can testify that it actually works SO well. I'm *so* bad about cleaning my brushes (I know...shameful), and this makes it super easy to clean a brush in a matter of seconds. So, even if I'm trying to do a *slightly* more elaborate eyeshadow look for the day, this makes the process of switching colors as quick and painless as possible. Also, it's *super* lightweight, and I've already tossed it in my bag and brought it on vacation with me. This is one of those products I won't be traveling without in the future if I plan on doing eyeshadow at any point — and it means you only need to pack one or two eyeshadow brushes!"" Promising review: ""This product makes it even easier for me to be lazy when it comes to cleaning my brushes. It also allows me to use the same brush for a makeup look since I can swish away a previous shadow and move on to the next. Great buy. Super easy to wash."" —Azaleah Bumpus-Barnett Get it from Amazon for $5.99. Rapid Brands is a California-based small business that specializes in dishwasher-safe, microwaveable, BPA-free kitchen products.  Promising review: ""No clue what makes the magic happen in this thing, but it is amazing. Macaroni in under five minutes, ramen in like 3.5. Easy, one dish to clean, fast. I wish I had this in my son’s toddler years in his mac phase."" —C. Long Get it from Rapid Brands on Amazon for $6.99+ (available in six colors and a two-pack).  Promising review: ""I saw this on TikTok and wanted to get it. I wear glasses daily and often don't realize how dirty they are until I see a reflection through them. I've used cloths before, but they get weirdly oily and leave smear marks. This does not. I love it so much, and I don't lose it in my purse."" —Clair F  Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in 19 colors).  Nerdwax is a US-based small business that specializes in all-natural anti-slip eyewear products.  Promising review: ""I can see why it's one of the most successful products seen on Shark Tank. Truly a game changer. I thought I would forever struggle with my glasses moving down my nose all day long, but this really keeps them put! One less annoyance to deal with while wearing glasses. I already know I'll be a lifelong customer for this product."" —M.L. Gomez Get it from Nerdwax on Amazon for $9.99. A reader just like you bought these and likes them so much they left a comment saying so:  ""I stumbled upon a review for this bra in one of your posts, immediately headed to Amazon to check it out for myself, and omg, I had to immediately order one because for the price, why not, right?! Well, it came in, and I loved it so much that I had to order more. No more overpaying for the Bombshells from Victoria’s Secret; these bras are hands down way better and also only a fraction of the cost! I cannot say enough good things about them. I absolutely love them!"" —shelbypeach Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in band sizes 32–40, cup sizes A–D, and 10 colors). The kit comes with six adapters (to make them fit various bottle neck sizes) and six purple dispensing stands. Promising review: ""This is such a great tool for using every last bit of product and reducing waste. We used this on a bottle of lotion that we thought was empty but got nearly six more months out of it when we put this on. We were shocked. I use this for my shampoo and anything else that I can think of."" —Felishia Rae Get the kit from Amazon for $9.86+ (available in two colors and three pack sizes). Click & Carry is a small business that specializes in easy-carry accessories.  Promising review: ""TikTok made me buy it. This is great when you have a few bags and a box — for example, if you balance the bags, you can throw it over your shoulder and walk inside and have two free hands to carry the box, which is great. Product seems well-built and is comfortable on your shoulder or hand because of the padding."" —Hung Get it from Click & Carry on Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven colors and in packs of two).  The reviews for this post have been edited for length and clarity."
86,Elizabeth Lilly,Save Time And Stress: 29 Products To Help You Glide Through TSA Faster,https://www.buzzfeed.com/elizabethlilly/save-time-and-stress-products-to-help-you-glide-through,"These, unfortunately, can't make *other* people glide through security faster.View Entire Post ›",2024-06-09T23:01:02Z,"We hope you love our recommendations! Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. These, unfortunately, can't make *other* people glide through security faster. BuzzFeed Staff I put off getting TSA PreCheck and even Global Entry for YEARS despite flying ~10x a year because I'm a person who likes to get to the airport early and have getting through security down to an efficient routine. However, my breaking point was July 2021 when I had to wait soooo long at the airport when coming back to the country from Croatia (I had Mobile Passport at the time, but the machines were broken so I had to wait in line with everyone else). I went to Italy about a month later after signing up for Global Entry and coming back into the country was a breeze. I just had to let a machine take my picture, print out a receipt with said picture, and then place it in a nearby TSA agent's open palm. Then onto baggage claim! I've since used the Global Entry portion six times and the TSA PreCheck about a dozen times since getting it. So I feel as if I've already gotten my money's worth in less than two years.  Apply with the Department of Homeland Security for $100. Once you're approved, you have to do an in-person interview and if approved on the spot, you can have your TSA PreCheck and Global Entry privileges available immediately. I just so happened to find a date for my interview the day before I flew to Italy and was able to update my boarding passes and flight reservations with my info to reap the benefits ASAP.   I recently finally gave in to getting Clear after enjoying Global Entry and TSA PreCheck for 2.5 years. The hook was...the (pricey) annual fee is covered by my American Express Platinum every year! You can do most of the work online for an application and just spend a few extra minutes at a Clear kiosk in an airport terminal before you go through the security line. So the application is more convenient than Global Entry (no need to go in for an official interview) and gets you through the security line much faster than TSA PreCheck. I travel about 10x a year and have always been put off signing up for Clear because of the annual fee. Though, I (and so should you) take advantage of every single credit card membership benefit that I possibly can, so that was the clincher for me. Is it worth it if you only fly a few times a year? Unlikely. And if your main airport doesn't have the kiosks, it's even less worth the money. But if your credit card or someone else (like, ahem, your job that makes you travel) will foot the bill, go for it! Sign up for $189/year from Clear or visit American Express to learn more about credit card rewards, including the paid annual fee for Clear through AmEx Platinum.  Promising review: ""I hate packing — I mean, I really hate packing! I am always afraid I am going to forget something, and the entire ordeal is a stressful one for me. Since I have to travel a lot, this is a game changer. No more guessing if I forgot my underwear — everything I need is on this list. I am thinking of just keeping one bag totally packed, filled with the items on the list, and just add my suit in when I am ready to travel. :)"" —Dr. Oceanfront Get it from Amazon for $7. Promising review: ""I bought this bag for a trip I recently took and am extremely pleased with it. The versatility of being reversible (dark to light) was a plus, getting two for the price of one. It is soft and supple, and holds a ton of stuff! My 13"" laptop/tablet fit perfectly and there was still room for a lot of other travel stuff. The magnet that holds the flaps together was strong, too. I would definitely purchase this product again and will use it on future trips!"" —D. Webb Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in 17 colors). Promising review: ""I have always purchased handbags with lots of pockets and sections because I hate having to dig around trying to find something in the gaping hole of purses with no sections. But I have passed up so many cute bags because of this, and I was frustrated with having to do so. I purchased this medium size organizer, and I couldn't be happier!! It is very well-made, and it has so many great pockets to organize everything I need. THE BEST PART is, I can easily lift it out of one purse and put it into another one, and I always know where everything can be found. I wish I had gotten one of these years ago. When I first ordered this organizer, I didn't realize it had two zipper compartments on each side, and I was tickled to discover even MORE storage!!! With all the fun colors and patterns, it was hard to select one, but I've always been partial to polka dots. I love it and can't imagine anyone not being has pleased with this as I am!"" —Ronna Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in sizes S-L and in 26 colors). Now you won't even have to pull your suitcase outta the overhead! Promising review: ""This works out so well for me. I’m a flight attendant, and I’ve had an infinite amount of day trips over the summer. I got tired of carrying around my regular TravelPro spinner, so I finally ordered this. SOOOOO MUCH BETTER FOR ME. It’s light, has enough pockets, and can easily fit under a seat if needed.The ONLY picky thing I can think of is how loud it sounds going across rough concrete. The wheels aren’t as silent as others, but that won’t stop me from buying another in the future."" —Kayla T Get it from Amazon for $50.88+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""I’m so happy I purchased this bag! I’ve been using a backpack as my carry-on for years but saw this and thought I’d give it a shot. I was able to pack a small backpack (approx. 12""x14"" but the top was folded), a purse (approx. 10""x6""), Beats headphones (in their bubble case), a pair of Birkenstocks, and a travel blanket with plenty of room to spare. The side zipper/compartment is SO convenient to hold your cellphone/wallet/passport for easy access. I love that it sets nicely on top of a carry-on size bag without toppling over. The bag also has a shoulder strap which was nice to use when actually boarding the plane."" —Jen Get it from Amazon for $34.99 (available in 17 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""I love this little gadget. I used it to attach my jacket and computer bag to my luggage on an extended business trip. It made my airport walks so much easier. Now that I'm back home, I've been using it daily to attach my jacket or cardigan to my work bag or purse."" —Michele Get it from Amazon for $8.49+ (available in six colors). The travel belt is adjustable to 38 inches to fit most bags. The belt itself is vegan leather with elastic accents and a quick-release buckle. Cincha Travel is a small business in California that develops adjustable travel belts made out of vegan leather. The brand donates 100 airline miles for each purchase, which are used to reconnect separated migrant families. Get it from Amazon for $40 (available in 16 colors). The wallet has a passport pocket, boarding pass compartment, three credit card slots, an ID slot, a slim card pouch, slim pocket, a ticket slot, a cellphone pouch, a coin zippered pocket, key holder, and pen holder.  Promising review: ""Guys, I'm beyond happy with this. I've been looking for a passport and ticket holder for a while but had never found the right size until I decided to try out this one. Besides, the material feels high quality and long-lasting, the red color is even better in person and it's wildly pretty."" —BazantSol Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in 31 colors). I own these and have worn them sooo many times. And as far as washing goes, they wash really well! You'll just have to make sure that you put them in a well-ventilated area to dry because they do take a while to dry. I discovered this a few years ago when I ventured into an extremely muddy corn maze and got my foot stuck in muck. I hosed off my shoes beside the farm's pig pen and expected to have to throw them away. The light gray (which I own in addition to this burgundy hue ^) washed really well, and then nearly a year later I wore them alllll over Athens, including trekking up to and all over the Acropolis where I saw tons of people fall. Did I mention they have excellent traction and you can wear 'em without socks?! Get them from SUAVS for $78 (originally $96; available in 10 colors and whole sizes 5–12). I bought this water bottle before a 2.5-week trip to Vietnam (where you don't drink tap water) and Malaysia (where you do). I didn't want to bring one of my ride-or-die S'well bottles because it would take up extra room in my bag when I wouldn't be able to use it during the majority of the trip. This handy silicone bottle did just the trick! It's very easy to roll up and *stays* rolled up thanks to the just-stretchy-enough loop. Said loop was also very handy while walking through airports and just around sightseeing. The bottle is easy to clean and doesn't make my water taste weird. I'm now using it as my daily water bottle and feel confident it'll serve me well for a long time. Plus! With a collapsible water bottle it's easier to remember if you left water in it before you go through security.  Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.99 (available in 14 colors/styles). ~Trust me~ when I tell you that these will work in a pinch. I bought them a few years ago to take on a bachelorette party to New Orleans, and everyone in the Airbnb was grateful I did. Since then, I've always had them in my carry-on bag when going on a trip. They REALLY came in handy when I went to the Greek islands for 10 days with an apparent mission to eat every piece of seafood and cheese within sight while washing it down with jugs of wine. These are powder in small individual packets, so they're so easy to pack! And also you don't have to lug around a bottle of Gatorade to feel better.  Get a 24-count from Amazon for $26.97. Here's what former BuzzFeeder Kayla Suazo had to say:  ""It’s literally gum with 40 milligrams of caffeine (about half the amount of caffeine in an average cup of coffee), so it’s great to chew throughout the afternoon without having to worry about it keeping you up at night. It also has 60 milligrams of L-theanine, which is the main amino acid in green tea, so you get a natural energy boost without all the sugars that you’d find in energy drinks. THIS MEANS NO JITTERS. NO CRASHING. Just a good ole boost of energy. I was skeptical about this gum at first. I thought there was no way gum could wake me from my afternoon lull and increase my attention so I could get more work done. Guys, I was wrong. This stuff works, and works well. I even gave some to my coworkers, who said they noticed a difference immediately after chewing it. Around 2 p.m., I pop a piece in (I looove the cinnamon flavor) and I have an instant energy boost. It’s magic. There are nine pieces in a pack and I chew about one a day, so an entire box lasts me a month — which isn’t bad considering that it literally gives me life every single day. It's gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free, vegan, and non-GMO, and I think it's a way better option than energy drinks."" You can read BuzzFeed's full review of NeuroGum for more deets! Get a nine-pack with six pieces of gum each from Amazon for $24.  Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $18.  This is me on a week-long trip to Croatia in 2021 with three city stops that I did a carry-on only for, knowing I had a tight layover in Amsterdam and would be riding two ferries. But, um, my hair had to look good for wonderful sunset photo ops such as this. (The bar is Buza Bar in Dubrovnik, go there!) So I packed a shampoo bar by another brand that I felt pretty meh about and this wonderful new go-to bar. Here, I used hotel shampoo (it was pretty fancy, NGL), this shampoo bar, and my roommate's Moroccan Oil curl cream. The bar is basically foolproof. You rub it directly on your wet hair after rinsing out your shampoo. I normally wash my naturally curly hair once or twice a week but on this trip was taking daily dips in the sea, so I washed my hair 5x over a week. Because of this, I let the conditioner sit for a few minutes, though you probably don't need to do that if you're washing your hair your usual amount on your trip. Each bar is supposed to last 200 washes and it might do a little less for me, but I know this'll be good for many future trips! I've used it on about five trips now and it doesn't look any smaller than it did when I used it the first time.  Get it from Amazon for $13.99. When I was a kid, someone told me that mosquitoes love me because I'm so sweet. And I FULLY believe that as an adult because I still get eaten alive if I'm out for long periods of time without wearing some kind of repellent. I've used these wipes on several park days here in NYC (sitting on a picnic blanket drinking wine with friends is more or less screaming ""COME GET ME"" to skeeters). But I've really found success with them on a recent hot weekend trip to Savannah, Georgia. I don't notice any smell when using them and have found one wipe to have enough repellent for my arms and legs. So basically, a one and done. I don't think that I've gotten *any* bug bites on days I've used these wipes. Plus, I have extremely sensitive skin but haven't had any irritation from these seemingly powerful wipes! Get three packs of 12 wipes from Amazon for $25.47. Their plush microfiber gently lifts away dirt, oil, and makeup! Use it wet with water or your fave liquid makeup remover. Promising review: ""This product...I have no clue how this works, but it does! Let me start by saying I was wearing a full face of makeup. I mean foundation, contour highlight, eyeliner, seriously the whole nine yards. All I did was wet it and wiped my face, my jaw literally dropped. This is hands-down my favorite makeup remover. The best part is that they are reusable so you don't have to keep buying those expensive disposables that leave your face feeling greasy."" —Heather and Ryne Griffith Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in four colors). Yep, I also own and love this set! it includes the zippered bag, four soft silicone bottles with leakproof caps, three compact jars, an two toothbrush caps. I've used this set on more than five trips and and for trips when I don't require body wash or shampoo (like to visit my parents) I use the extra room in the bag to shove in all my beauty products and daily contacts. Plus! It comes with labels that stay on the containers really well despite my thoroughly washing these containers between trips. I bought this set in spring 2019 and have, admittedly, lost a container or two. But the ones that I've held onto over dozens of trips have all held up well! Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in six variations). Promising review: ""Everything I needed fit perfectly, and I had no issues in TSA/China security. So far I have been through MSP, IAD, NKG, and PEK airports using this pack already, and it's a life-changer! I will never again have to worry about having to scramble to buy baggies just for liquids, and it is much more durable."" —Courtney Swanson Get it from Amazon for $12.86 (available in 10 colors). I've used containers like these to carry shampoo, conditioner, hair masks, body wash, clothes detergent, and more.  Promising review: ""This product delivered on the description. Traveled abroad, no leaks, easy to fill and dispense, and easy to clean. Don’t be fooled by other products that will become brittle and crack. Buy these, you will not be disappointed."" —Gary Rebok Get a pack of six from Amazon for $10.99. Each pack comes with three packets. And, because they *are* liquid, they'll easily slide into the side of your toiletries bag. I've packed these on international trips to much success! Promising review: ""Taking these out of the country to wash under things is exactly the right size."" —Laura Wilson Get nine packs from Amazon for $6.60. I first bought this for a weeklong Croatian vacation last year when I did carry-on, and as long as you are *thoroughly* reapplying, this stuff stays on pretty well. On a beach club afternoon, I did haphazardly reapply and missed a strip on one arm, but I tend to do that with spray-on or lotion sunscreen, too. Since then, I've packed this for any trip I've been on, including a two-day Disneyland trip where I toted this around in my bag and shared with friends. I sometimes carry it with me in my purse on my everyday adventures because I know it's so easy to apply. Also worth mentioning...I am about the palest lady you've ever seen and swear by daily application of sunscreen. But when on a beach trip, I'm constantly swimming in the water and sweating. So yeah, this stuff works.  And if you're a bit hesitant about jumping on the solid sunscreen bandwagon, you can pack a stick of this, knowing you have enough sun protection to get you through to finding some spray-on or lotion SPF at your destination.  Get it from Amazon for $10.17. Promising review: ""No more tangled headphone cables! I bought a pair for my desk at home, and I'm purchasing another pair for my office. I love how neat and untangled my earbud cords are when using this organizer. It's leather, which I'm sure will last many, many years for such a great price."" —Jane M Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in five colors). Promising review: ""This is the perfect travel companion. It fits everything including an Apple TV, HDMI-to-VGA-converter, and multiple lightning and micro-USB cables. I haven't been disappointed at all. Plus, it packs nicely in a backpack and goes everywhere."" —iamtheoneoff Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in two sizes and four colors). Or if you're traveling solo (like I normally do), you can get away with sticking your electronics cords into a zippered pencil or makeup pouch that'll also slip easily into your personal item.  Promising review: ""I bought these for a trip for my family of five. I like to plan in advance to make sure no one forgets anything! These were a life saver packing for three kids! I was able to create a carry-on, toiletries, wires/chargers, and snacks pouch for everyone! I used clear sticker paper to create name labels, and it all worked perfectly! Would definitely recommend if you need to travel with family and need to set things out and pack."" —mommyandbri Get them from Amazon for $17.99. Promising review: ""These are really comfy. They're a good compromise for comfy skinny jeans. I'm a 30-year-old mom, and I'm about a 12/14; a 12 in these fit PERFECT. They give you a nice booty, and I can bend in them without showing anything. So that's a definite bonus. They are a good mom jean without being a MOM JEAN. Thumbs-up."" —Polka Dots Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in women's sizes 2–28, three inseams, and 18 colors). FYI, if you have Amazon Prime Wardrobe, you can give this a spin before you buy it! And they come with a hand pump for travel! Promising review: ""This is a great product. I have a memory foam pillow that I try to take on trips, due to neck issues, so I purchased this product and put it to the test to see if it could flatten the pillow so I can also carry my clothes and the pillow in the same bag, carry-on size travel bag. The pillow's been sitting in the vacuum pack for the last three days now and hasn't let any air into the package at all. The pump removed so much air that the foam is as solid as a rock with less that an 1/8 of an inch of give when I press on it firmly with my thumb."" —4-H Shooting Sports Instructor Get a pack of five from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in six sizes). Again, just be sure to look up any weight restrictions on carry-on luggage. I ran into that problem last summer (it was in Croatia while flying British Airways, btw), but the person at the airport check-in counter that gave me some trouble about my bag just seemed to care about my roller carry-on. So I'd suggest using these in a backpack or tote bag you plan to put under the seat.  Promising review: ""Easy to clean, lightweight material. All of the compression bags have a mesh front which makes it easy to see what’s inside, plus there is a small clear vinyl pocket on the front for a label. I tested one of the medium bags with four sweaters (one long and bulky, plus three medium-thickness pullovers). They fit in the bag nicely with the bag zipped closed (not compressed yet). It was not difficult to zip the compression closure, although I did take special care to push down and 'help' the zipper along. No signs of strain or damage to the zippers once fully closed. These bags seem very sturdy. As seen in the pictures, there is a significant size reduction! Will definitely use in my travels and would highly recommend."" —Clarissa Sheats Get a pack of six from Amazon for $19.99 (available in three colors).

If you don't want to be feeling 🫠🫠🫠 about blisters this summer, you need a set of these cheap moisture-wicking socks, stat. BuzzFeed Staff Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products.  Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action.  Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $8.99.  Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products.  This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (although TBH, if this list of bugs gets any longer I may just stay indoors forever!!).  Promising review: ""I cannot stress to you enough how much better this simple little tool has made my quality of life during summer in Ohio. It rains a lot. There are a lot of mosquitoes. I have horrific allergic reactions to mosquito bites. We're talking bumps swelling to the width of softballs within minutes of the bite. This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY. I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me. If you live anywhere where insect bites are common, you need to own one of these."" —Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.95. Psst — a lot of reviewers mentioned this also helped prevent peeling and itching! Promising review: ""I bought this product to take on our vacation. I am so glad I did. I got burnt on my lower legs and tops of my feet. I thought I had put enough sunscreen on. I didn't. That night I woke with my legs and feet both burning and itching. The instant I put this on I had relief. OMG I cannot say enough about this stuff. Buy it. Keep it on hand. Great product. Thank you Burt's Bees!"" —D.S.  Get it from Amazon for $17.14. Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines.  I've had one of these for awhile, and I love it! I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.  Promising review: ""This was another one of my TikTok purchases! I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth, so I thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazingly! My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use, and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard. Those tiny bristles really get in there, and if you push too hard, you might be sore like I was. It felt like after going to a dental cleaning."" —Amy N.  Get a two-pack from Amazon for $8.91.  Read more about how an epsom salt soak or bath can help with muscle pain and soreness at Cleveland Clinic. Check out a TikTok of the foot masks in action.  I'm a long-ish distance runner, and these were certainly an interesting experience for my feet! You slide them on and, after a few minutes, feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. After that my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in. The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days!  Promising review: ""Very soothing. My husband and l used these on our European vacation and they definitely felt good on our feet!"" —KS2018 Get a set of three pairs from Amazon for $11.97.  I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run. They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some ""yikes!"" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough.  Promising review: ""These socks are designed perfectly for running socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you. The size is true to fit.  I've purchased many packs of these and they are the best I've tried."" —SmokeyBear Get a pack of six from Amazon for $16.95+ (available in four color combos and sizes S–L). Soft Touch is a small business that specializes in personal care products for feet.  Promising review: ""I was dubious at first, having seen this on TikTok. I can now confirm that it works as directed and the results are amazing. Twenty-four hours after I soaked my feet in the plastic bag, nothing happened. Then 48 hours later it started working. Seventy-two hours and it was in full working mode. Like other reviewers, I also suggest just letting the skin come off naturally. The shedding lasts for a few days. Results are incredible. Will use this again!"" —Vanessa Get it from Amazon for $13.25+ (available in four styles).  Promising review: ""After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per a friend's recommendation. I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help. This totally changed my outlook on shaving. My neck especially would be the worst. I dab it on immediately after I rinse and dry, post-shave. It does burn a bit but that goes away pretty quickly. Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore. I only apply it once after shaving even though the directions recommend repeat applications the following day. Go ahead and purchase, you won't be disappointed!"" —bill nye Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in two sizes). Basic Concepts is a small business that specializes in personal care products, home goods, and office essentials.  Promising review: ""My husband and I have been using this product for a couple months now and we both think it is worth the purchase. It is not a magic fixer for bad breath or lack of oral hygiene but paired with a good dental hygiene routine we have noticed a positive difference such as fresher breath for longer and fresher breath upon waking in the morning. It is easy to clean, and the shape prevents gagging. All in all the product is definitely worth it."" —Brimichelle Get it from Amazon for $8.95.  Promising review: ""I have ordered this twice now. If my skin is breaking out I just spray this on after washing my face and let it air dry. It is non irritating and non drying. It has a light chlorine smell to me. I can use both morning and night with no irritation. After a few days of this my skin starts clearing up! I put some in a travel spray bottle and take it when I’m flying. My skin always feels dirty on planes and I spray it on a few times on travel days to freshen my face and hopefully kill some bacteria. It sprays over makeup with no issues."" —SaraSmile11 Get it from Amazon for $17.46.  IceBeanie is a small business that specializes in cold therapy products.  Promising review: ""I don’t usually write reviews but this thing is literally a game changer. Amazing quality, so comfortable to wear, and it really helps me to relax and also when I have a headache. This is top shelf. I am so happy with my purchase!"" —Bonnie Boughton Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in two colors).  PureWine is a small business that specializes in wine accessories.  Promising review: ""What a difference these have made in my life. With my allergies, it was impossible to enjoy a glass or two of wine without nasty side effects: stuffy nose, red face, and headaches. Now, I can have a glass of wine and not have to dart to a package of antihistamines! Makes a great gift. Even thinking of splitting a box into stocking stuffers. Each wand is individually wrapped. Have purchased these several times and will continue to do so."" —KellyH Get a set of three from Amazon for $11.99. Promising review: ""TikTokers have done it again. This was one of the products on Amazon a person could not live without, stating all-day freshness. It's true, I cannot believe it. The taste isn't strong, it does not burn at all. It keeps my breath smelling fresh all day no matter what I eat. This brand will be a new staple in my bathroom and morning routine."" —Zac Get a pack of two from Amazon for $14.57.  Promising review: ""This stuff really helped eliminate the dry flakes I was having. Every once in a while my scalp goes through a period where it’s just so dry and itchy. I use this stuff once and it’s drastically improved! I used to use the scented one, but honestly I really dislike the smell. When I found this scentless one I was so happy! It really works, trust me."" —Amanda S.  Get it from Amazon for $7.26 (available in different sizes).  You should change the pads every 48 hours, and note that they do not work on moles, birthmarks, warts with hair growing from them, genital warts, or facial warts. The brand notes that you should not use this product if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation. Promising review: ""These work amazingly well! I had taken my daughter to the dermatologist and paid a hefty amount for them to burn a wart off of her arm. It didn’t get rid of it; they only made it smaller, and they recommended a follow-up appointment. Then I found these! She wore one overnight, and literally the next day, it was smaller to almost nothing. Looked just like a small scar. Now it’s completely gone after wearing it only two times. One time overnight and the next day. That’s all! I will never try any other treatment for warts except for this!"" —Cole Hagele Get a pack of 14 from Amazon for $7.29. Read more about acupressure and nausea at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Promising review: ""These were awesome! My entire family suffers from motion sickness, especially carsickness. My little one gets sick in the car on a regular car ride through the city. So I knew that a long road trip was going to be a disaster. I was amazed at how well these bands worked for everyone! Not one single person complained about being sick for 12 hours in the car. I have suffered for decades and now I know better. I will never travel without mine again!"" —1SmartCookie Get a set of two from Amazon for $7.99.  Promising review: ""I wish I had found these sooner!! These cold sores were probably the worst I've had and wouldn't clear up or stop itching/hurting. I googled cold sore remedies, and these happened to pop up. After reading the reviews, I immediately ordered them. They came right on time, and I put them on before bed last night. It's been less than 36 hours, and these cold sores are already healing beautifully. I plan to order another pack or three, so I can keep one at home, one in my purse, and one in my locker at work so if I ever feel the warning tingle/itching of a new breakout, I can slap one of these bad boys on and get rid of it quickly! Highly recommend for my fellow cold sore sufferers."" —Jessica Hill Get a pack of 15 from Amazon for $13.50.  I swear by this to the point where if I can't find it in the morning of a run, I just won't go out, LOLOL. My boobs chafe SO BADLY under my sports bra bands, no matter what kind I'm wearing, but putting on a tiny bit of this before I leave works like a charm. Absolutely no more friction and no more going ""OW OW OW"" in the shower because my literal boob wounds were stinging. Promising review: ""This was a TikTok buy and it was worth it. Highly recommend it. It does the work. Long lasting and not sticky at all."" —EBATL Get it from Amazon for $8.99. Psst — you should definitely ""patch test"" this on a small area of skin before putting it on to ensure you don't have any reaction!  Promising review: ""I saw this product on TikTok, and I decided to give it a shot since it was only like $20 for 10 wipes (that's 10 weeks, 2.5 months) of no underarm sweat. It worked! I was so happy to finally be able to wear all the shirts I own that are not black!"" —Nes172011 Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (each box lasts two months). Check out a TikTok of the sand remover in action.   Shakalo is a California-based small business that specializes in sand removal products.  Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1x–2x a week. I even use it on my dogs paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of. I will definitely be buying the refill and another baggie to have exclusively in the car."" —Gabbs Uresti Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (clip the 20% off coupon on the product page for this price).  This product has the APMA Seal of Acceptance! Promising review: ""I’ve been dealing with a bad fungus nail for about three years. I’ve been trying to use products off the shelf and bought one here, you know the ones with the brush. It never worked ’til I bought this one. Let me tell you, it only took just under a week to see GREAT results. It’s pretty much gone and it’s been less than two months. Buy it and don’t think about it! You won’t regret it!"" —itslilac Get it from Amazon for $16.49.  Promising review: ""I have always had serious dark circles and bags under my eyes, and this has really changed this for me. The results are incredible. The puffiness is gone. The dark circles are hardly noticeable. My sensitive skin has not broken out. I never write reviews, but this was so good that I had to write a review. This actually works."" —Ben ""Better than Tula! I love this cooling stick!! It’s super easy, affordable, and smells lovely."" —Heather Get it from Amazon for $9.99.  Promising review: ""RUN to buy this, I repeat… RUN. I bought one of these about two years ago and it’s STILL going strong. Aquaphor is amazing, we all know that. Buuut the convenience of having it in a tube is life changing. It truly is as easy as one, two, three. It can easily be applied to anything you could possibly need. I’ve used it on brand new tattoos, dry/chapped skin (hands, feet, legs, lips etc.) and the edge of my hair line to protect my skin from hair dye!"" —Tara Fossa  Get it from Amazon for $10.47.  Promising review: ""I have ordered several pairs trying to find the one that lives up to its hype, well this one is it. Super cushy, fits true to size — I ordered the mauvish pink colored one and love it. I will be ordering a black pair. I have a heel spur and plantar's fasciitis so regular flip flops bother me after wearing several hours, these do not. Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend."" —leah Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and 21 colors).  Comfilife is a small business that specializes in comfort-based personal care products.  Promising review: ""Life-changing on a long trip! My partner wanted us to drive from Colorado to California. I wanted to fly because I had a fall, and half of my body was in pain. He talked me into it, so I purchased this pillow for the car ride. What a game-changer! It helped so much with the pain, and I would recommend it for anyone in the car!"" —Nadia Get it from Amazon for $31.65+ (clip the 10% off coupon on the product page for this price; available in three colors). Promising review: ""Super happy with this purchase! The price of 10 headbands is about the same as I have paid for one name-brand headband, so I was expecting sub-standard quality. But they are really great. I've worn them and washed them, and they are holding up well. They stay in place when I am working out hard or running. They are great at absorbing sweat, too. They probably stay in place a little better than the expensive headbands I have. The colors/designs are super nice, too. One of the best purchases I have made in some time!"" —Terri D Get a set of ten from Amazon for $13.88. Apply this daily 2–3 times a day as long as needed. Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""This product is amazing!! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid bump forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was just getting bigger and more irritated by the day, nothing was helping. I bought this stuff and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn’t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side."" —Jordan Caprigno Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks). Psst — it's  also gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free!  Promising review: ""I love this stuff!!! In Florida, where the sun can take the moisture out of you between the heat and the humidity, you can tend to get a little dehydrated, no matter how much water you drink. I put one of these packets ion my large water bottle and drink. I start to feel better soon after I drink one. I don't do more than one a day, unless I am working extra hard outside in the summer heat. It reminds me of lemon/lime sports drinks without that awful sugary after taste."" —N. Abdallah Get a pack of 16 from Amazon for $21.11.   Promising review: ""These have been brilliant to use, draped around my neck on the long walk back to my car after gym workouts. They are lightweight and perform exactly as described. I’ve even been able to work in my yard in the Florida summer heat for the first time in years. Affordable and well worth the money."" —Kim Pinson Get a set of four for $13.69+ (available in 12 color combos).  Check with your doctor before starting any new personal care regimen. Note: these should be worn barefoot, and not while wearing any shoes.  Check out a TikTok of the Yoga Toes in action.  Promising review: ""I have an overlapping toe and a bunion that just started to form on one foot. I use the YogaToes daily for 15–30 minutes to help create space between the toes and relax the feet. I love how my feet feel when I take them off and start walking around. My feet feel stronger and more relaxed. I am a fitness instructor and also teach yoga. I use them before class for a few minutes. They help me feel more grounded as I move."" —Deirdre Sherman Get it from Amazon for $36.95.  Hustle Clean is a small business that specializes in personal care products for athletes.  Promising review: ""These are amazing. They really do totally freshen you up after a hard workout or run. I live in New Orleans, and even after a long summer run, if I am in a bind for time, I can use one of these and be totally confident regardless of where I need to go. Individually packaged so you can keep one in the car, one in the gym bag, one in the desk, etc. Great to have at work if you have an afterwork event and don't have time to run home and freshen up beforehand. I have turned several of my friends and co-workers on to these."" —Randy C  Get a 40-pack from Amazon for $29.99. Apply this gentle treatment 3–4 times a day or 4–6 times for more concentrated breakouts. Read more about tea tree oil and acne at Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I’ve used this product for about two months now. I try to remember to apply at least twice a day. Not only is the skin clearer, but the overall texture is much smoother and softer. I highly recommend giving this lotion a try."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99. Check out a TikTok of the heating pad in action. Reviewers note you should definitely wear it *over* your clothes!  Promising review: ""Oh my god. This might be the best thing I have ever bought. It gets so incredibly warm. You do need to wear it over clothes to prevent burns but as someone who never finds any heat pack warm enough the lowest setting is exceptionally hot. As someone who has really bad menstrual cramps and chronic constipation this little belt does it all. The heat is so soothing and adjustable and heats up so fast. The vibration is my favorite part. It helps so much with trapped gas and bloating pains. The various patterns and heat combinations allow this to be truly customizable to however you feel at the time and it’s fantastic. Absolutely worth every cent."" —Chloe Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in nine colors).  Each pack comes with bandages to fit your heel, toe, and foot. People who wear heels also recommend these!  As a blister-prone human, I swear by these. A few years ago, before I invested in running socks that prevent blisters, I got a blister on my big toe so unspeakably large and painful that I am cringing even TYPING about it, and no amount of rest from running seemed to heal it; it just kept coming back. I finally used one of these bandages, and the pain was virtually gone from the moment I put it on. It was also so airtight that nothing got inside, and it didn't loosen in the shower. You're supposed to take it off when it loses adhesive so it can come off gently without disturbing the blister if it hasn't fully healed yet. After using two of these in a row over the course of a week and a half, my blister was finally healed up enough that it stopped coming back.  Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in four types of packs).  ComfyBrace is a small business that specializes in pain-relieving compression products.  Promising review: ""This glove (I wore only right side) worked very well for the post-surgery nerve pain. After the surgery, I had the nerve pain on my right index finger and could not focus during work. The combination of this glove and small hand warmers helped me feel less pain for six weeks. It dries quickly after washing, too. I strongly recommend this product."" —TJ Get a pair from Amazon for $9.97 (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""I don't like to talk about it, but every year, my nose becomes super dry to the point where I sometimes get a bloody nose. I usually use some squeeze saline, but it got so bad this year that I decided to get this gel. A dab on a finger or a swab and my nose is hydrated, moistened, and not dry as a desert. No winter bloody noses! It is very light, is not slimy or like Vaseline, and it does not have any smell."" —Catherine Get it from Amazon for $3.62.

Promising review: ""I have three young kids who like to get messy and usually spill things on themselves — this spray is a miracle worker! I haven’t found a stain this stuff can’t get out! I’ve even had stains that weren’t new come out with this spray! Wish they had a bigger bottle option but for now this works. Not a huge fan of the smell but it’s not a huge deal because it gets washed anyway."" —Heather & Kresten Get it from Amazon for $7.49.  Promising review: ""I've been wanting an auto scroll feature on the apps for reels/TikTok for ages, and I was a little delayed in researching options to achieve just that lol. But I found this remote control that fits on your finger and, although it was an impulse purchase, I am NOT disappointed. Bluetooth and long battery life paired with a comfortable ring feature on your finger to click and scroll makes for the perfect combo when you're laying in bed and you get your phone propped up just right and want to skim thru reels/toks, or if you're in a lovely bubble bath and don't want to risk holding your phone above a potential watery demise...this is the product for you"" —Shelby D. Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in five colors) I have the Simple Modern one too, and it's great for being at home and drinking water at the perfect temp. *But* if you're worried about leaking AT ALL (or prefer a metal + silicone combo straw to plastic), the Brumate Era is 100% wizardry, sorcery, and magic. It claims to keep ice for over 24 hours — I've had cold water stay COLD for ages in this bottle! The tapered base is also cupholder friendly, and the whole darn thing is dishwasher safe, too! Let me tell you, this is my new favorite water bottle. I can lock the lid with a quick twist, and throw it LITERALLY SIDEWAY in any tote and not even think *twice* about it leaking at all! And...if you've seen some of those videos about hidden mold in certain lids...know that this disassembles incredibly easily, so you can just toss the pieces in the dishwasher. Promising review: ""As a nurse I know we are picky and loyal to brands of pens and water bottles. I’ve had a Stanley, Owala, and a giant hydrojug. This tops them all! I had ice from over 24 hours left! It fits in my car cup holder, the handle is sturdy, the straw breaks down easily for cleaning, and it’s TRULY leakproof! Yeah the straw is exposed but I just wipe it down with little alcohol wipes from work before I drink from it. Those that say the lid is hard to get off, you have to turn the lid to drink mode to unseal the lid and then you can turn it. LOVE THIS!"" —Dani Get the 40-ounce size from Amazon for $44.99 (available in 13 colors, plus a 30-ounce size). Promising review: ""The parchment liners did not work in our air fryer. ""Smells like burning!"" Not unusual in our kitchen when I'm cooking, by the way. Still. It shouldn't be due to an outside source like the parchment liners that we had. I like to set off the alarm all by myself. These worked great! No muss. No fuss. Highly recommend."" —Margaret K. Gajkowski Get a set of three from Amazon for $8.99.  I bought a pack of these recently, and so far love dusting with them! All the dust sticks right on, so you don't end up breathing in all the dust you just tried removing. It's great for baseboards, too! Promising review: ""I rarely review products, but this little sponge literally changed my life! It picks up EVERYthing in one swipe! Hard water marks on your bathroom mirror, no problem! Hair clippings on your sink and counter, one swipe and they are gone! Dusty blinds? Swoosh, swoosh, swipe! And ala-presto ka-bam, like magic they are perfect and dust free! I just need one of these for my floors! I love, love, love how the sponge picks up everything and with a little running water, all the dust, hair, muck and guck just rinsed away!

Here's BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord: ""I personally bought this a few months ago and love it!

I purchased to help with knee pain from cycling, and I just make sure it's on tight and just underneath my patella and I have zero pain or discomfort now. Would definitely recommend. Comes with two braces!"" —Amazon Customer Get a set of two from Amazon for $12.99 (available in seven colors). Promising review: ""These were the things I never knew I needed for traveling. They work just as advertised and are really useful when going on a trip. I always hate at the end of a trip having to mix dirty and clean clothes — a 'laundry bag' or plastic shopping bag never really felt like a good enough separation. These bags seal up and conceal the most stinky, wet clothes from your clean unused clothes. They are going to be one of my new necessities for my big family when traveling."" —Sarbello Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.97.  How effective? Well it's commonly likened to the Magic Eraser in paste form! Promising review: ""Honestly I was very skeptical when I first purchased. Everyone on social media was talking about how amazing this product was for cleaning around the house and I just thought they were all jumping on some kind of bandwagon. Of course I caved and had to try it for myself. Needless to say I’m very impressed! It removed stubborn mold and grime from my shower tile grout with use of a hard-bristle toothbrush. It removed hard water stains from my sinks and faucets. I noticed it really does remove mineral buildup, but it takes a lot of elbow grease and repetitive applications before you start seeing progress. The texture feels similar to when you mix honey with sugar to make a lip scrub, except it’s super-fine grit and more pasty like putty or clay. It works amazing so far! No overpowering smell (barely any smell at all), easy to use, and a little product goes a long way. I haven’t tried it on rust yet so we’ll see how that goes. Overall very pleased and impressed so far. Highly recommend!"" —Marissa  Get it from Amazon for $5.97. They'll keep your feet warm (and dry) in up to -15°F. Promising review: ""These socks have just changed my life. I am not even kidding. I suffer all of the time from feet that are painfully cold when the temperature outside is anything less than about 75 degrees F. It is horrible. I wear double socks with slippers; still have cold feet. Always having them tucked under a few thick blankets while watching TV, etc., but still feeling the cold in my feet. Well, I saw the reviews and ordered these. I put them on this evening, put on my usual slippers, and shortly after I felt like I had an electric heater inside my socks. They feel so very warm and toasty. I have never had a sock that could do this. Even thick wool socks don’t do this. MY FEET ARE ACTUALLY WARM which is something that rarely ever happens. I am in LOVE with these socks. I could kiss whoever invented them."" —Linda Marie Nutter Get a three-pack of women's sizes from Amazon for $27.99 (available in sizes 5–9 and 8–13 and two color sets) and men's sizes for $27.99 (available in sizes 7–12 and 12–15 and two color sets). Promising review: ""I had no idea that cleaning a Keurig was a thing. I bought these because I saw them on TikTok believe it or not. I wanted to give it a go because my Keurig isn’t that old and I didn’t think it would do anything. IT WORKS SO WELL! My Keurig wasn’t as nasty as some I’ve seen, luckily. I would highly recommend, keeps everything runny correctly and clean."" —Lauren Get a six-pack from Amazon for $9.95.  Promising review: ""Initially, I really felt silly and lazy for buying this. But after using it, I feel like a genius and wish I bought it sooner! My kiddos love grapes and I love how it gives me a slight peace of mind knowing it can gets diced up, allowing me to briefly walk away if I need to with less worry. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase and I tell everyone how awesome it is!"" —Dom Promising review: ""I cannot believe that I’ve spent so much time in the past just slicing grapes and olives. This tool is absurd, ridiculous and absolutely wonderful. The pieces are just the perfect size for salads, either savory or sweet. I’m looking forward to trying it on grape tomatoes, too. I would give it more stars if I could."" —Minnie A. Hamilton Get it from Amazon for $11.95. Promising review: ""I really didn't realize how well it worked until I took the after picture. Then I felt bad that I had not done this before. Let me start by saying I did not even do this every day. I am bad about starting something and not finishing it, but I did use the two tubes that I purchased. I plan on purchasing two more so I can get my teeth whiter. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their teeth whiter."" —Sherri Blanchard Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.99. Promising review: ""I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue. Since my bathroom color scheme isn't on the blue spectrum, this is problematic. The well water also causes the shower glass to film up quickly. I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed till my arms ached trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess. My ambition in life is NOT to be a full-time bathroom scrubber! I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's TikTok (sorry, don't remember which one) and thought 'what the heck, might as well give it a try.' Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue and the glass looked clearer too. Day two, sprayed again and walked away. The next morning the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile and the glass looked amazing. Day three I sprayed the remaining spots and the next morning the shower practically looked new. NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner. The ONLY con I have is that it makes me sneeze while I'm spraying from inside the shower, but I can live with that."" —L. J. Petillo Get it from Amazon for $20.54. Promising review: ""I am amazed! I have dealt with eczema all my life. I've used steroid creams/ointments, lotions, wash, you name it. And then I tried this miracle product! In four days, my hands looks better then it ever has! I can bend my finger without pain! I'm sooo happy with the results. And I have only been using it for four days!"" —Kelly Promising review: ""My hands suffer every winter with not only dryness, but also cracking around the fingertips. I've tried many creams, lotions and paint on products that would work temporarily, if at all. I saw a commercial for O'Keeffe's Working Hands Cream and read many, many reviews on the the product. I've tried it and all I can say is that it's a miracle. The dryness has left my hands and my fingertips are well on the way towards healing....and this is after only two days of use. I wish I had found it years ago. It would have saved me lots of pain, agony and money."" —Desert D. Get it from Amazon for $9.64. They also make a version for your feet (tho you can probs use the hand one for your tootsies too), which reviewers ALSO l-o-v-e. Get it from Amazon for $9.48. Promising review: ""When I travel, my lips get so chapped! It's painful. I found this product when I searched for something for extremely chapped lips. I've used other O'Keeffe's products so I trusted the brand. I used this as directed in the morning and before bed and my lips healed up faster than ever. Also, on the next trip I went on, I took it with me and used it daily. My lips stayed healthy and didn't get chapped at all. This stuff is magic and I won't go anywhere without it now."" —Anna C. Adams Get it from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: ""I bought these for the same reasons most do — to be more environmentally friendly. I like the size of my Swiffer Sweeper, but always felt like I wasn't getting my floors fully clean. We recently got a new apartment, and I always like to deep clean before we do any major moving. I used them dry and wet. I've always been disappointed with how the disposable pads from Swiffer (barely) picked up dog fur and crumbs, but as you can see in the picture it picked up so much! This was already after using a traditional broom. Then using them wet with diluted Mrs. Meyers cleaning concentrate — wow! The water was BLACK by the time I was all done with our downstairs area. They were so easy to Velcro on and off, wet or dry. Once I was all done, getting them off and doing a quick rinse wasn't hard at all. I love that I am supporting a small family business with all the convenience of Amazon. I will definitely buy again (if I ever have to). I am so excited to use these for years to come and have a cleaner house than I ever have before!!"" —Kathryn Willer Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.25. Psst — if you don't already have one, you can get a standard Swiffer on Amazon for $9.99!  Reviewers say it sinks into skin easily and never ever leaves a greasy residue. Promising review: ""What kind of sorcery is this? I used this for the first time last night on some recent acne scars, and I'm in utter shock. They look like they've been healing for weeks.... this stuff must be made of pixie dust or something. It's way too good to be true. From now on, I will be putting this all over my skin before bed every night! I don't even care if it means washing my sheets more often — SO WORTH IT!"" —Julia Richardson Get it from Amazon for $9.95. Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do! You can read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""This stuff is magic, I’ve tried a lot of products and this one works the best out of everything I’ve tried. I love the scent, sol de jeneiro makes a body spray of it and I get lots of compliments every time I wear it."" —Stephanie Hooper Promising review: ""Where has this been all my life? I have been using this for maybe three days now, and putting it on in the morning and evening are the best parts of my day. The description of the scent as ""pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla"" does not even begin to describe the incredibly decadent smell of this cream on my skin. My skin feels like velvet and I saw improvements in the texture after the first application. I will use it for the rest of my life. Do not ever discontinue this! I did not expect to be so amazed my this cream, but it is life-changing. Buy it! You won't regret it."" —Michelle Brown Get a 2.5-ounce jar from Amazon for $22. And if (when) you do fall in love with the scent, they make tons of other products, including a fragrance! BuzzFeed Shopping Editor Amanda Davis says: ""So, I have about three pairs of shoes that have just been sitting in my closet because while they are sooo so cute, the leather was too tight for my foot to comfortably get inside 'em. Did I return them? Nope. (We all know the hassle of online returns, right?) Instead I bought this shoe stretch spray on a whim. I didn't expect much but WOW! The shoes that took me a minute of struggling to get into fit *perfectly* now!!  The process was as simple as could be, too. I just sprayed my shoes (inside and out, heel to toe) like there was no tomorrow, I put on some semi-thick socks (just to ensure I had ample room later), and wore the shoes around my house for about 30–40 minutes. As I was walking around, I could literally feel them begin to loosen up.  After about 30 minutes, I took my shoes and thick socks off, and the shoes just ~slide~ on. Easy Peasy. Now I have a new favorite pair of shoes and zero dollars have been wasted. I tried these with a pair of chunky leather loafers, but I can only imagine what they'll do for my pair of Doc Martens — the boots known to take a while to break into. This stuff is a must!"" Promising review: ""Straight up sorcery! This stuff is magic and makes new shoes way more comfortable and fit like a glove! I will definitely order more in the future. This is my new secret weapon."" —RockabillyKim Get it from Amazon for $9.99.  Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to made weeding easy.  Promising review: ""If you’re like me, you’re wondering if spending $40 on a gardening tool is worth it. My friends, IT IS. I’ve been eyeing this tool for some time now and finally pulled the trigger and I’m beating myself up for not doing it sooner. I have pulled 10 gallons of dandelions out of my yard in about two hours. This is pure magic. It’s actually fun to pull weeds. In the past I would try to rid myself of dandelions with broadleaf spray but it never worked and I wasted my money. This works every time and cuts chemical use! Win win! Just buy it already and thank yourself later!"" —Amy Get it from Amazon for $39.99. Grampa's Gardenware Co. is a small, family-owned business based in Oregon making tools for gardening. They've been making this tool since 1913!  Promising review: ""NEVER GETTING MY NAILS PROFESSIONALLY DONE AGAIN. I love having long nails. I do not like spending fifty bucks just to get them painted. I tried the gel polish, with gel top coat; I tried the gel system with the lamps; I tried every polish out there. My hands get washed hundreds of times daily. This stuff is unbelievable. It really works the way they say it does. I applied it about one or two minutes after finishing a second coat of color and within minutes it had bonded and set and my nails stay shiny and polished for over a week. That is not the full two weeks claimed, but I am unusually hard on my nails so over a week is AWESOME. I immediately ordered several more."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.15.  Check out a TikTok of the Chill-O-Matic in action.  Promising review: ""I was so afraid of wasting money. But I didn’t. I love my sodas cold. But sometimes there’s not a cold one available, and waiting 30-40 min for one to get cold in the freezer is not always ideal. This will get your room temp can to fridge cold in 90 seconds. I let it run double that to get almost freezer cold. I wish it had a power cord. But I do appreciate the portability that the batteries provide. I can’t wait to try it out on vacationing, as access to cold sodas isn’t always available. All you need is a literally a little bit of ice."" —G. Massey Get it from Amazon for $29.99.  Chill-O-Matic is a small business that specializes in beverage accessories.  Promising review: ""Like everyone else, I stumbled upon this product because of a TikTok I saw.

Workers of the world, unite."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in eight styles).  Promising review: ""OMG, it works. Just as described does what it says and doesn’t take off all your makeup. It’s a gift from the heavens and I hope they never stop making it. Just buy it, you won’t be sorry. 10/10, A+, chef's kiss!"" —Shannon M.  Get it from Amazon for $8.97.  Promising review: ""I saw these on an Amazon review video on YouTube and figured I'd give them a try because my boyfriend tends to leave the toothpaste bottle a complete mess and I can't stand it! These things have a great seal and give out a good amount of toothpaste when you squeeze it. It wipes clean very easily. So glad they come with more than one but not sure what I'll use the other ones on yet."" —Kimberly C.  Get a set of three from Amazon for $8.95.  Promising review: ""I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting Hydro Flask coffee mug; I tried everything — bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING — and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. It grossed me out so much that I bought ANOTHER Hydro Flask to replace it. Eventually they both got black inside, so I tried these little magic tablets. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY, without even scrubbing. They look brand-new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much that I used it on another Hydro Flask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge. I couldn't put anything else in it because it would always taste like spicy tomato juice. Bottle Bright to the rescue! No residual smell or taste anymore. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING."" —Amazon Customer Get a set of 12 from Amazon for $8. Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action.  Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I don’t know how I ever survived without this. There’s tons of 'pet stain/odor remover' products out there, but this by far is the absolute best. I cringed paying the $20 for it when others are between $5–$10, but I have NO ISSUES paying now. I foster dogs, some puppies, some older, some not housebroken and every room in my house is carpeted except the kitchen, which means I have lots of accidents. I spray enough to saturate if it’s a lot of urine, let it soak for 10 minutes then wipe it up with a hand towel. Then I put a larger towel on top of it if it’s in a high-traffic area until it’s completely dry. It’s taken out every stain, and more importantly the odor is gone! I will never stop buying this product. I recommend it to everyone who has dogs!"" —Shelley Get it from Amazon for $19.31. Promising review: ""This is, BY FAR, the best primer I have ever used. I have very dry skin, moisturize it day and night, and no matter what I use and do to make my skin and makeup look better, foundation looks dry on my skin and makes me look old and accentuates every wrinkle. I've been blaming it all along on ineffective moisturizers and foundations, and I have spent a fortune on beauty products. This Elf primer is smooth as silk, highly moisturizing, and make my foundation look wonderful. I'm still in shock by how well this product works for me, and I pray that Elf will never stop making it. Of course everyone's skin is different, but all I can say is that it works beautifully for me, and I'll be buying this primer for the rest of my life!"" —Jayden Smith Get it from Amazon for $9.99. If you leave it in long enough, it'll even give a lavender tint if you're into that! Promising review: ""I never write reviews, but this stuff is magic in a bottle. I'm a level 7 blonde with high-level highlights and hair that loves to pull red. If my hair starts to look brassy, I use this, and voila — it looks like I just came out of the salon again. I'd love it even if it didn't make my hair feel soft, but it does that, too! Please don't ever stop making this!"" —scooptwins Get it from Amazon for $16.99. Just wait 15 minutes and rinse to reveal your glowiest glow yet, thanks to the albumin (aka egg white) and aloe formula. Promising review: ""Smells great! This face mask does exactly what it says. My skin is nice and lifted, hydrated, noticeable reduction in fine lines, improved texture, reduced my pore size, and eliminated some newly developed rough patches forming around the hairline. Couldn't be more satisfied with this product! I have pretty good skin for 37, but this mask has really helped take my skin to the next level"" —Samantha Get a box of eight masks from Amazon for $25. Promising review: ""My engagement ring had gotten really dull over time. I hadn't even really realized until I came across a picture of when I first got it and noticed it didn't sparkle anymore at all. Which was what I had loved so much. I tried EVERYTHING. Soaps, soaking it in baking soda and a little vinegar and dish soap, rinsing it, etc. and nothing was working. This cleaned it up immediately and completely restored it to its former super-sparkly glory! It gets into all the little crevices and clears away all the fogginess. Will definitely purchase again and again!"" —Sheila  Get it from Amazon for $7.99. This is the same brand that makes the Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask so many people swear by. Promising review: ""I've been very careful when lightening my hair, but the straw feeling is sometimes inevitable when bleached. THIS PRODUCT IS MAGIC. I've always gone to my hairdresser when coloring so I've been fortunate to have my hair stay pretty nice, but this made a world of a difference. My hair is like silk or soft butter. So incredibly soft and shiny that I feel like a walking hair commercial. My hair feels so moisturized and healthy, just as soft if not softer than my hair was prior to coloring (been highlighting for five years now). Will be buying more before I run out; I will never stop using this product. FYI, my natural color is dark brown at the roots, and my hair looks healthier than a natural blonde IMO :) ADD TO YOUR CART; YOU WON'T REGRET. After you shampoo, load your hair up and do the rest of your shower heck have it be a long shower bc you deserve it, and rinse out with lukewarm water."" —Meghan Davey Promising review: ""I have 4C hair and was looking for a protein treatment for my thin and fragile. I had recently used a product in my hair that had so much alcohol in it that wreaked havoc on my hair, leaving it pretty damaged. I was very skeptical about this product because I had never seen anyone with my hair type use it. Boy, was I wrong to doubt this product; it left my hair looking and feeling beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone natural or with curly hair."" —Therese-Claire Get it from Amazon for $6.68. Promising review: ""Great quality. This product is the only thing that works for my razor burn. I hope they never stop making this."" —LethalVows Another promising review: ""After many years of razor burn on my face/neck, I finally broke down and bought this per a friend's recommendation. I have sensitive skin and had given up hope that anything could help. This totally changed my outlook on shaving. My neck especially would be the worst. I dab it on immediately after I rinse and dry, post-shave. It does burn a bit but that goes away pretty quickly. Totally worth it to not have razor burn/bumps anymore. I only apply it once after shaving even though the directions recommend repeat applications the following day. Go ahead and purchase, you won't be disappointed!"" —bill nye  Get it from Amazon for $26.99. Here's BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord: ""I swear by this to the point where if I can't find it in the morning of a summer run, I just won't go out, LOLOL. My boobs chafe SO BADLY under my sports bra bands, no matter what kind I'm wearing, but putting on a tiny bit of this before I leave works like a charm. Absolutely no more friction and no more going ""OW OW OW"" in the shower because my literal boob wounds were stinging."" Promising review: ""Bodyglide is the best product I've found to help prevent chafing, bumps, and irritation! It's been a lifesaver for my legs and allows me to wear shorts, skirts, dresses, without feeling like my legs are on fire! This is great at preventing irritation and is also really soothing if you already have chafing. I use this before working out and I'm able to run without any discomfort. It's a must have for summertime when I live in shorts, dresses or skirts. I only use this on my thighs, but you can use it anywhere you want. One stick can last a really long time depending on the size. I had my last one about six months. It really does help skin to glide and not rub. Love it and I hope they never discontinue it!"" —katie Get it from Amazon for $8.99. Promising review: ""I have actually had mine for years. My cousin asked me about my clean face the other day, giving me the opportunity to tell her about it. I bought this one for her. It is easy to use, can be used anywhere, fits easily in small purses, is quiet and the battery life is good, besides being easy to clean. A must-have!"" —Candy Osias Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in four colors).  Promising review: ""I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement! However, I find it's a great arm workout and it works wonders."" —Joanne Ertel Get it from Amazon for $24.99. Promising review: ""Saw on TikTok (don’t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you’re left with a clean sink!

It’s so much fun, and I felt so drawn to it as soon as it was in my hands. I am smitten over these kittens. 😍 10000% worth the purchase!"" —Kathryn Prouty Get it from Amazon for $17.79. Check out a TikTok of the rain cloud diffuser in action. Promising review: ""Love it! It’s so super cute! We call it our shroomcloud. It's peaceful and the mood changing colors are the best! I love hearing the subtle sound of water. Ahhh, zen! Works great as a diffuser with a few drops of your favorite essential oils, too."" —Krissy  Get it from Amazon for $39.90. Promising review: ""I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I’ve minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It’s a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway so it’s not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!"" —Barbie Get it from Amazon for $17.95. Promising review: ""So, yes, TikTok made me buy this, but so far I really like it. It's obviously very adorable and offers a charming spot to keep my keys that works with my entryway. I'm really surprised by how strong the hold is for such a small object — I carry my car fob and a few keys and so far it's holding strong. I hung it with command strips to avoid any potential damage to the wall and I will say make sure it's level as the hold is not so good on an angle (but that was from the original in-hand testing). Definitely recommend and for the price, I'm very tempted to get one for my at-work office."" —D. Carter  Get it from Amazon for $7.48.  Novelty888 is a small business that specializes in delightfully and oddly specific talking buttons.  Promising review: ""Got this for my wife to keep on her desk.

TBH, I use them as decor every bit as much as I use them to eat. Sometimes I just keep them in my work area to light them up during the day to feel fancy. They toggle back and forth between a bunch of different colors, like red, blue, yellow, purple, and multicolor, so you can either make them match *or* have a red and blue one together and bring ~balance~ to the Force. Get it from Amazon for $11.97. Handy Cute Art is a Florida-based Etsy shop that specializes in quirky home products.  Promising review: ""These are the cutest ever! My daughter ate these guys [a lot] growing up. Great reminder gift of her fave snack food!"" —Teresa A Houtz Get a set of six from Handy Cute Art on Etsy for $10.20 (originally $12).  Promising review: ""I was actually curious if this was actually going to work and if it would look cheap, but it's well made, sturdy, and looks pretty cool. You can use other liquor bottles. Don't be fooled by the empty bottle and lack of weight. I tried full bottles of unopened wine, and it's held up really well. For the price point, you can't beat it, and you will definitely get lots of compliments!"" —KGP Get it from Amazon for $15.60 (available in five styles).  If you are unfamiliar with this glorious witchcraft, Shrinky Dink paper lets you color designs on it that you can then cut out and bake to shrink them down, giving them a stained glass effect that makes them great for keychains, suncatchers, and little trinkets.  Promising review: ""Fun for ALL ages! Recently remembered how fun these were. I have a smaller daughter, so it gave me an excuse to buy these. They're secretly for me — half kidding. These are so simple to use and create great crafts. These will keep your little one's imagination going, occupied and helps practice fine motor skills. I would definitely recommend to ANYONE, not just little humans."" —Alex Soper Get a 25-sheet set from Amazon for $14.99 (available in four styles).  Promising review: ""I am obsessed with this funnel!!! I juice a lot of citrus and juices for cocktails, and this little guy is the perfect size for bottling. It’s beyond cute and really great quality.

The perfect addition to any cottagecore kitchen!"" —Abbey Klem Get it from Amazon for $16.95.  Check out a TikTok of the snail teabag holder in action. Promising review: ""Love these fun little quirky tea slugs. They work on all shapes and sizes of mugs and have brought a smile to all who either used them or were the lucky recipients of their own batch of tea slugs from me. They clean up well with just a quick rinse under the sink and are even fun to use on wine or cocktail glasses to help guests track their drink."" —NC Get a pack of 10 from Amazon for $6.99. Promising review: ""These were super tasty and super fun, we used these at the kids' table and they had so much fun building and eating. Definitely a big hit!"" —Marina Get a pack of three bags from Amazon for $9.99.  These come in six different scents: lavender, aloe, ocean, rose, milk, and olayer.  Promising review: ""Disco in my bath! This product is such a nice distraction from a stressful life! The scents are not overpowering light and soothing, they don’t seem to deposit rings a real plus with a soaker tub! But the best part save the little center bit and set aside for a real party with wine and candles. Sending these out to stressed family now as random pick me ups."" —Katrin Sullivan  Get a set of six from Amazon for $20.99.  Check them out on a TikTok of the cat and mouse hooks in action.  Promising reviews: ""These are so cute!! I get so happy seeing them hanging by the door waiting to pop back down for when I leave for work. Take the car keys and it's gone. Come back from work, hang them on its tail and they stare at you with this unamused glare. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase!

I gave it to my husband as an early Valentine's Day gift. We both love it. Easy to use. Beautiful lights. Bigger than I thought it would be, which is great. The candlelight setting makes for a great night-light. Well worth the money, and looks better in person than in the pics."" —Felipe Get it from Amazon for $39.99.  Promising review: ""This thermometer not only works perfectly, but is a great conversation starter at gatherings!

Promising review: ""Saw it one day when I was just browsing. That’s usually dangerous I know. It’s actually heavier than I thought it was going to be, in a good way though. It’s not cheaply made. I’ve gotten a few laughs from people in other vehicles. Only side effect is if you get upset at other drivers it isn’t very intimidating when you’re giving the mad stare. LOL. I was pleased with the purchase in all."" —Charles Ramsey Get it from Amazon for $6.85.  Promising review: ""Absolutely love my Nessie bookmark. Product looks exactly like the images on the website. Very durable and small boost of serotonin every time I pick my book back up to read.

Being a plant parent is hard, messy, and sometimes frustrating but we've found some things that'll make the process a whole lot easier. BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review: ""I bought a new home in the woods and haven’t really gardened before. The previous owners already had a very impressive garden. Me being new to the scene, I wanted to learn as much as possible to keep up my garden beautiful, fresh, and healthy. This book has everything a first-timer like myself could need. From plans, designs, sowing, pruning etc. I was also excited about the fruit and vegetable section, as I plan to grow my own. I definitely recommend the Complete Gardener’s Guide book. It just arrived today and I’ve been flipping through, bunny-earring pages all night. Excited to prune my rose bushes tomorrow after reading the section on them."" —QueenJ Get it from Amazon for $20.48+ (available in hardcover or spiral bound format). Promising review: ""I have never kept a plant alive until I purchased these, now I'm excited to buy more plants and more of these globes! They are beautiful to look at, work fantastically, and personally I find it cute to see my plants drink up the water like they're sucking it through a straw. I have succulents, golden pothos, and a palm tree and all of them have grown tremendously after using these globes. I will ALWAYS recommend these for any plant lover.😁 I know some people have had trouble with the soil clogging it but if it is too tightly packed into the dirt it can happen, all you need to do is take a toothpick to clear the bottom and I find it best to place them back in the same spot."" —Kyleigh Get a set of two from Amazon for $15.95. This set includes: one programmer, a 33-foot tube, a power adapter, a filter, seven T-joints, three cross-joints, five tube blockers, and 12 watering stakes.

Buy the set, you won't be sorry!"" —Bobbie Get a six-piece set from Amazon for $25.98. Promising review: ""I needed something sharp and small enough for deadheading smaller blooms but that would also do well with any size of bloom. These are my new favorite pair. They're sharp and easy to use. The small push lock that keeps the blades locked closed is very easy to unlock and relock. I would highly recommend these to any gardener professional or hobbyist like me."" —JoJo   Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three colors and two blade options). Promising review: ""Love this soil additive! But, be careful to add just a little at a time! I have used this product for the last 15 years, as a High School Horticulture teacher. Really comes in handy when school is closed for the holidays! I could come in once over the holidays and water my plants, and they looked great! I always put some crystals in a bowl, about 2 or 3 tablespoons and add water, to expand them before I add them to the soil. (I’ve cracked a couple of nice pots not doing this.)  I also add fertilizer to the water, so the crystals take up the fertilizer as they expand. The crystals release their water to the roots as the plant dries out, so you will see the soil level retreat, an easy cue to add more water!"" —Roseann R. Get it from Amazon for $12.23+ (also available in a two- and five-pack). For best results, replace spikes every 30 days in spring and summer; replace every 60 days in winter and fall. Promising review: ""I swear by these plant food spikes!!! The package says they are for indoor plants, but I actually use them for all of my outdoor plants, especially my herbs. I first tried these after planting some basil and other herbs that seemed to be taking an eternity to grow. I figured I'd give them a try since they were so inexpensive and wow!!!!! Within just a few days, my plants had grown more than double what they had grown in the previous several weeks!! One of my friends (who also enjoys gardening) came over to my house and was in awe of how big and healthy all of my herbs were. When I told her about these spikes, she went straight from my house to purchase some and had the exact same growth results."" —GatorDO17 Get a pack of 48 spikes from Amazon for $7.97. Read our full review of the Miracle Grow plant food spikes.

I move them around so birds don't get used to them!"" —Sentimental ""We placed these on the ground looking out of the garden and change their locations weekly.

Ordered a variety of different herb and vegetable sticks including some custom and they all came out exactly as ordered and described."" —Lauren Get it from Wood N Sparks Co on Etsy for $1.75 a stick (originally $1.95). Promising review: ""At first I was hesitant. How could little sticky tabs on a stick control or eradicate my fungus gnat infestation? I had tried various pesticides, but those killed my plants too. So, in desperation, I tried these. They had good reviews and people said they worked wonders. Well, add my name to that list. These things worked fantastically! I bought these on June 28 after battling fungus gnats for months, the problem was only getting worse. It is now August 9, and I can honestly say I haven't seen any gnats in my house flying around. I still keep the tabs out just in case, and occasionally I'll catch one of two, but for the most part they're gone and it's 100% due to these little tabs! And I didn't even use all 7 traps!"" —Katheryn Camm   Get a pack of seven from Amazon for $10.01. Here's what BuzzFeed writer, Courtney Lynch had to say about this: Using a soil moisture meter is easier than you might think. I've been using this particular model for years without any issues. All you have to do is insert the metal stem into the soil of your plant (about three to four inches deep) and view the moisture reading. When you're done, wipe it clean and store it until your next watering session. I like to measure the soil moisture both before and after watering to make sure I've given my plants a nice big drink without overdoing it. Promising review: ""This is a remarkable little gadget! All gardeners need this in their arsenal of tools! #1. no batteries!!! #2. simple to use #3. no more overwatering your beautiful plants!! I have already bought 3 of these for my gardening friends and they love it too! It has saved so many of my plants from overwatering.

You'll have an easy-to-read digital LCD screen, min/max readings, data hold, auto power off, and low battery indication. Different plants require different amounts of light, so be sure to do your research and use this handy tool accordingly! Promising review: ""Yaasssss! Why didn't I get this sooner? First off, they sent the meter with a set of batteries! Finally, a company that anticipates you needing batteries with the device! Second, it works perfectly. I know nothing about reading light for plants and this thing was super easy to use. I saw the readings, checked Google for what the levels meant and I was good to go!"" —Nastasia Marquez Get it from Amazon for $29.99. These LED grow lights are designed to mimic sunlight at noon, which is ideal for most plants during all growth stages. The three auto on/off timing options are available at intervals of four, eight, and 12 hours. The time for each LED bar can be controlled separately. You're also able to adjust the brightness across five different settings. The sturdy clamp can be applied to various surfaces and the 360-degree adjustable gooseneck allows you to direct the light in any direction. Promising review: ""I bought this for my beloved little tomato plant I was gifted late in the summer and didn’t want to lose to the winter weather. This indoor light is the easiest thing to set up, very self-explanatory. Works amazing! My plant has grown incredibly in the weeks that it’s been indoors. The timer setting has been a lifesaver. There are different brightness settings, which I’ve used on several different occasions based on my plants' needs. I can’t recommend this product enough."" —Taylor Sandberg Get it from Amazon for $22.49+ (available in 50 or 75 watts). Grampa's Gardenware Co. is a family-owned small business based in Oregon making tools for gardening. Promising review: ""Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get, especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled."" —JG Get it on Amazon for $44.99. Promising review: ""These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly. They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall."" —A.Consumer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $16.99 (also available in an eight-pack). Promising review: ""These fit perfectly around most of my indoor plants that need help growing in an upright position. The green color blends in with the plant and you don't even notice it's there.

Insecticidal soap is made with natural plant extracts that dehydrate and kill certain insects on contact. It's recommended to spray at the first signs of insects and their damage. Continue to apply regularly to keep your plants free of pests. Promising review: ""This spray took care of our bonsai aphid problem.  We combined our strategy with the sticky traps and we have seen tremendous improvements. I really would suggest a dual approach if you are facing the same issues. Most importantly, this spray did not harm any of my bonsai or houseplants. And we have tried them on essentially all of them. Note: we have only been using this on indoor plants."" —Michael Get it from Amazon for $11.15 (also available in a six-pack). Promising review: ""The insoles are removable so you can use your own insoles in these — added bonus. Also the heel area underneath the 'factory' insole is built up some to provide extra cushion in that area. I bought these to use outside in the garden when it is a little too wet so I don't mess up my better shoes. They are a smooth design that should keep my feet clean for quick times outside, yet are a solid design so as to not allow my feet to get dirty and need a foot bath before coming in the house. As well, these shoes will spray off easily when dirty."" —jamieLeigh Get them from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in women's sizes 6–11 and 25 different colors/patterns). Promising review: ""This is great for the garden. Keeps my knees out of the stickers and the padding is very comfortable, helps me get up and down — easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. Haven't tried sitting on it but i'm heavy and this feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary."" —Cpt Dragon Get it from Amazon for $32.99. Nompi Glove Company is a woman-run small business in New Jersey that makes garden gloves with long, pretty sleeves. The idea came to founder Lynne Eichenbaum after she contracted poison ivy while tending to her vegetable garden. Promising review: ""Just as pictured. Made well. Great idea.

Southside Plants is a woman-owned small business that was founded in Fort Worth, Texas by fellow plant-lover Meg Renninger. They create everything from their own potting soil to fertilizer spray.   Promising reviews: ""I love these wipes for my fiddle leaf fig tree. The wipes are scentless and have a good texture for getting the dust and grime off the leaves of your plants. They’re really convenient and the packaging is pretty! Highly recommended."" —MP ""These are amazing and they look and feel like they should be more expensive lol. There are a ton of wipes and you could honestly cut them in half and do two plants. They stay wet for a long time so you could wipe each leaf and it will still be damp. I usually wipe with pest prevention spray every six months or so but this helps keep them clean in the mean time and the ingredients are actually good for the leaves. Just get it you'll love it!"" —Luke   Get it from Amazon for $16.99. Promising reviews: ""Does exactly what you want it to. I do my own potting mixes in the bathroom of our Manhattan apartment, so this makes cleanup a breeze. We just empty it in the trash/compost, rinse it off in the shower, and then wash and dry it. If you are just doing basic repotting or simply potting mixes, you probably won't even have to do all that."" —Jay B ""If you do a lot of indoor repotting and such dirt work, this is a great idea for a cleaner work area. I must have used this 20 times in the first week I had it. Portable, easy to clean, transforms from flat to button corners for sidewalls to being rolled up and stored in your desired location. I will have this for a long time based on how good the materials."" —Grvr   Get it from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in six sizes and three materials).  Promising review: ""If you have vining plants, you MUST get these! Not only do they blend into the plant, they make it so easy to direct vine branches where you want them to be!"" —Mimi Get a 72-pack from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: ""I am always looking for great ways to display all of my plants, and these shelves are PERFECT! I love that the shelves themselves are almost invisible and it looks like my plants are just floating in front of the window. I never really wanted to put blinds or curtains on this kitchen window, and this a perfect way to utilize the light and decorate the window while displaying all of my plants! I am very happy with the quality of this product. The acrylic shelves are very sturdy and I found the assemble to be straightforward and easy...As someone that is concerned about putting too many extra holes in drywall and trim, I really appreciate how the shelves hang from the window casing and are merely supported by a few finish nails to keep them from sliding off. I think this design is ingenious and I really appreciate the thought that went into this product. I also appreciate that the kit comes with everything you need to hang the shelves including a level!"" —Brent M Johnson Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available with various shelves and four sizes).

I stained a pair of beloved bright-blue bike shorts in my sleep and tried to get it out with soap and water, but the stain was still there when it came out of the wash. I treated it with this, stuck it back in the wash, and BOOM, it's like it never happened (I panicked before I could get a before and after, please forgive me, laundry gods)."" Promising review: ""As long as you let this stuff sit on stains, it will remove most. Yesterday I let my toddler wear a white shirt. Throughout the day she covered the shirt in food; blackberries, popsicle juice, condiments, etc. As soon as bath time came around and the shirt came off, I gave it a good spray, let it sit overnight, and washed it on the white cycle.

I have four dogs in the house and two toddlers. I have no problem and hate with pulling this mop and bucket out to mop. I can throw the mop head in the wash or be lazy and buy a new one.

My toddler has recently had a bout of drawing on everything with crayons, markers, sharpies, pencils… you name it.

The pencil which I would normally scrub off with a Magic Eraser (and I mean, SCRUB), wiped right off with this stuff! Same with the crayon on the tile, which couldn’t be scrubbed off normally. Now, while I continue to teach my lovely toddler NOT to draw on walls, I will at least have peace of mind that it can be removed easily and he can go about trying to destroy something else, because it won’t be my walls or tile/grout now!"" —Gretchen Get it from Amazon for $5.97.

I always had a problem with vacuums not sealing well and all the stuff goes flying everywhere, but this one has NO issue with that whatsoever. It’s great. If you're second guessing, just do it!!!"" —Katelyn Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (clip the 20% off coupon on the product page for this price; available in three colors). They can of course be installed horizontally and work on microwaves and ovens, too!   Promising review: ""These are great for keeping finger marks off my refrigerator handles and the color blends well with the stainless steel door. They are easy to put on and take off so I can spot clean them if needed. They would be wonderful for a household with young kids and sticky fingers."" —Amazon Customer Get a set of two from Amazon for $11.99 (available in two sizes and in multipacks).  It could take a few applications to get your shower totally banish the soap scum and hard water buildup, according to some reviewers, but it will! And yes, it works on glass shower doors! Promising review: ""I was skeptical but with two toddlers my showers hadn’t been cleaned as well or often as I would like them to be. Since we needed deep cleaning I used it daily for about a week. You spray it on after a shower then rinse it off before the next. Use hot water to rinse and it takes off soap scum and mildew better than my cordless drill sponges with comet and it’s way less work! I wouldn’t say the smell is good but it also isn’t an overwhelming chemical smell that makes you feel like you shouldn’t be breathing it. Now we’re in maintenance use of once a week and I’ll never go back!"" —bebeslo Get it from Amazon for $20.98.  Rocco & Roxie Supply Company is a family-owned small business established in 2013 that specializes in pet odor eliminators, pet toys, pet snacks, and pet accessories. Promising review: ""Not only is this great for pet stains, it’s also great for toddlers who are working on being potty trained. Took the urine smell right out and was very easy to use. The product itself smells amazing. Worth it!"" —emgil93 Get it from Amazon for $19.97. Promising review: ""At first it didn't look like they were going to work but they are amazing! My toddler has a bunch of magnets on the appliances and between those and her sticky fingers they were very dirty by the end of the week. I will always buy these!"" —Nikki W.  Get it from Amazon for $4.49.  Check out this TikTok of the Folex Carpet Spot Remover to see it in action!  Promising review: “You cannot beat this stuff. I use it to clean up everything from sick dog messes, toddler messes, baby blow outs, and even red lipstick off of a white blanket! I’ve never had it stain/leave marks on any of my surfaces from a white onesie to my micro-fiber couch (got dog poop off the light gray couch like a champ, sorry for the gross image) with no staining or residue left behind. We’ve bought probably six to nine bottles of this stuff, just to help clarify how much we love it."" —Max Get it from Amazon for $6.65+ (available in two sizes and in multi-packs). Promising review: ""These are my new favorite cleaning wipes. They are thick and large, clean great on practically any surface. And best of all, they leave a wonderful fresh clean scent! I use these for everything, I have two toddler boys, so surfaces are always sticky. These wipes take off the sticky so easily. I wipe our dining room table, countertops, window sills, and even my fridge dry erase calendar. No more Clorox wipes for this house!"" —Katie Klenz Get a pack of 90 from Amazon for $14.98.  And like, who's got time to monitor THAT?  Promising review: ""I absolutely love Affresh tabs. I have a front-load washing machine and these tablets keep things fresh and clean. I keep the door closed between washing cycles, and after a few weeks or so, there is a tendency to get a mildew smell and mold buildup on and near the rubber seals. I also have a toddler and do A LOT of laundry. I try to keep the door open and the rubber seals dry after each use, but that's nearly impossible with a three-year-old closing the door whenever he sees that it's open! These tablets have been so helpful in keeping my washing machine clean!"" —Dan G.  Get a set of six tablets from Amazon for $10.18. Skoy Enterprises is a woman-owned, California-based small biz.  Promising review: ""These have saved us so much money when we consider how many paper towel rolls we have saved from all the messy faces and tables our toddlers leave behind. Highly recommended for any parents out there! Easy to clean and sanitize too!"" —Mike A  Get a set of four from Amazon for $7.99 (available in 14 color variations).  Promising review: ""Excellent product. Smells so good and works on door panels dash and center console. Even removed crayon off the rear door with ease. A challenge my 4-year-old daughter decided to put this product against. Hands-down great choice will stock up here."" —Bryan B.  Get it from Amazon for $11.97+ (available in three sizes and various bundles). Promising review: ""This works so well!! I have a toddler who loves to dump her cups out on to my back seat and this product has done such a great job getting up 2+ years of stains. I used a scrub brush and let it soak for a few minutes before I began scrubbing. I’m ordering more to go over it again. This has REALLY revived my car and I don’t need to feel so embarrassed anymore. On another note, the scent is gentle and smells pretty good."" —James G.  Get it from Amazon for $14.42. Promising review: ""I rarely believe in 'miracle' products. But I am truly impressed with this stuff! I have a 10-year-old table and chairs that has almost survived toddler boys — it's taken a beating. The finish, especially where they sit and I wipe constantly (because: kids), is just sad and dull. I've tried a number of cleaners and polishers and most make it look good for a little bit, but went back to dull as soon as it dried. This stuff really put a shine on the surface and wasn't greasy at all!  This is something I'm going to keep on hand and try to use periodically to really keep my furniture looking nice."" —Megs814 Get a bottle from Amazon for $9.37. The brushes drain into the base so they dry, then the little holder in the base removes so you can easily empty and clean it!  Promising review: ""I love this thing so darn much. I wish I had found it sooner. It's so cute to look at on your counter and I love that it's an easy and attractive way to keep various brush sizes handy for cleaning all the little baby/toddler cup pieces."" —HnDn0809 Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available with the pot or as only replacement brushes).  Here's what BuzzFeeder Heather Braga has to say about this: ""I have this drying rack! We keep it next to our full-sized drying rack and as my son has gotten older we've also started using it to dry reusable food pouches (and all the pieces that go along with that) as well as his sippy cup and any teethers we've washed.""  Promising review: ""Easy to use and clean. Use for toddler cups, plates, utensils. Love how everything just sticks upright."" —Veronica Q  Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in three styles). Check out a TikTok of the bath toy storage bag in action.  Promising review: ""I wish I had bought this forever ago! Just buy it! It holds enough for my spoiled toddler and works so well at scooping. The suction is great I haven't had a issue at all."" —Martina Cobb Get it from Amazon for $12.97.  Check out a TikTok of the ""Emergency Stain Rescue"" in action.  The Hate Stains Co. is a small business that specializes in fast, powerful, and nontoxic stain removing products.  Promising review: ""This stain remover gets out most stains and is absolutely amazing! Moms of toddlers should buy several bottles of this stuff! I have found that the sooner  I spray the clothes to treat the stain with this the better the outcome!"" —kendall Get it from Amazon for $6.12 (also available in packs of two or three, and with on-the-go wipes).  They may or may not actually make your clothes dry faster, but they will help gently soften things and last for at least 1,000 loads — my mom has some she's used consistently for over 10 years now and they're basically like new. You can add a few drops of essential oil to one or two per load for a light, pleasant scent. And theoretically, at the end of their life, you can compost them or recycle them with other fabrics, because they're wool.  Promising review: ""After reading how dryer sheets and fabric softener leave chemicals on your clothes and having a toddler with sensitive skin I decided to try these. I have been using these for a couple of months now and they work great. My clothes are wrinkle and static free. They do their job!"" —Julie V Get a set of six from Amazon for $11.99.  Even better? It features an odor filter to help prevent that icky trash smell from permeating your entire home!  Promising reviews: ""It’s amazing, and does exactly what it says. The odor elimination that came with it still works, my trash does not smell at all. The motion sensor, like my toddler says, is magic! You will not regret it."" —Briseyda ""Cat and toddler proof. This the best item I could have ever purchased with a three-year-old and two cats. I also don’t have to worry if we forget to take the trash out that night, the odor control is pretty good."" —Trice Get it from Amazon for $85.71+ (available in 13 styles and sizes). This vac moves between hard floors and low-pile carpets/rugs without a glitch and can pick up all the accumulated dust, dirt, and hair left strewn about your home while you go do literally anything else.  It can find its way into corners and along baseboards, uses smart sensors so it won't fall off of things like stairs, and comes with a remote control that allows you to schedule cleanings whenever works for you...then heads back to its base to recharge all on its own.  Promising review: ""I love this. This has to be the best purchase I’ve made yet. It’s easy to set up. We recently just moved & we have hard wood floor. This is absolutely my best friend, especially with the fact that I have two toddlers."" —Jasmyne Hutchins Get it from Amazon for $199.99+ (available in two colors). Check out a TikTok of the Command spray bottle hangers in action.  Promising review: ""I use these mostly to keep chemical spray bottles out of reach from my toddler. It's effective and easy to install. Holds the bottles securely. It's pretty much exactly what you would expect, with not flaws or disappointments."" —Emily Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.52.  Promising review: ""So why do I like mopping slippers? I have a 2-year-old and the slippers are great for mopping up little splashes. Drops of water from doing dishes and the extra padding is nice. No paper towels wasted and it's immediate. Plus these are cute. You have to have a sense of whimsy for this functional novelty item."" —G. Kim Get it from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in four sizes and 17 styles). Reviewers also talk about how their very helpful toddlers like to use these to clean pet hair, since it's so easy! Promising review: ""I don’t typically leave reviews, but I had to leave one for this awesome pet hair remover. We use this on our couch, and it takes five seconds and gets every last bit of white dog hair and even toddler crumbs!"" —Amber Mahan Get it from Amazon for $19.99. This is sized to work with the standard Swiffer; get one on Amazon for $18.44! Promising review: ""We bought these to use on wood floors. These are super absorbent and fit well on a Swiffer. I was able to use one pad on two rooms and it still wasn’t saturated with dirt or cleaner. (And I have two toddlers and two cats.) I highly recommend!"" —Eric Gardner-Flores Get a two-pack from Amazon for $10.94.  Check out a TikTok of the cup washer in action. You do need a sink with a flat edge to install it — and it comes with the instructions and materials you'll need to set it up.  Promising review: ""Never knew I needed one until I saw it on TikTok, and with water bottles and toddler cups it is essential to my household!"" —Gayla Brink Get it from Amazon for $21.99.  I bought a bottle of this stuff when I moved in 2021 — it was super useful then to seamlessly remove adhesive residue off the walls, and since that point I've used it to clean stubborn grease off of kitchen cabinets and my stove's hood several times, and pulled it out for several other mystery sticky stains and messes. Works every time! Promising review: ""So my toddler left crayons in the backseat and cup holder of my car during 100+ degrees of Texas summer. No scraping or scrubbing worked. It's been a year since I've accepted the pink and green blobs in my car but this cleaned it right off in minutes. Bring on the backseat color time!"" —Julie Phan Get it from Amazon for $8.20. Check out a TikTok of the Laundry Turtle in action. Promising review: ""My dryer is in my garage. The floors are always dusty. I don't have a table for a laundry basket. I also have to open a few doors to get back in my house. This opens up my hand to work doorknobs. Sometimes I'm carrying my toddler with me. Now I don't have to put my toddler in my laundry basket."" —C. Martineau Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in two sizes).   Promising review: ""Easy to use, did a wonderful job on my leather sofas and recliners, which suffered the wrath of three hyperactive toddlers."" —JM from NYC Get it from Amazon for $18.95+ (available in two sizes).

The Spot and Stain is also available solo on Amazon for $12.99! Promising review: “Honestly, this is a nice little gadget. Since buying it, I've reached for it more than I realized. My son is four and has had several spills, potty accidents, and even walking mud through the house. Every time an accident occurred it was nice knowing I had this in my arsenal to combat the mess. Honestly, I can't believe I didn't get this sooner. It makes cleaning messes a breeze and has removed stains from my carpet. Worth every penny. And I would highly recommend it. I plan to use this to help me clean the interior of my car next.” —Meshelly Price: $98.59 Promising review: ""I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these organizers!! I almost did not purchase them due to the reviews saying that larger than a C cup would not fit into the bra organizer. At just $15 for four organizers, I took my chances and ordered two sets of four. I figured, worst-case scenario I would have to cut the dividers out of the bra organizers. I wear a 32DD, and the bras fit beautifully in the organizers. I am so glad I took the chance and did not listen to the reviews. I would have missed out on the best cheapest organizers I have ever found. I ordered another set for tank tops and other extras I had not thought of before. I will also order brown ones for my boyfriend's drawers. Great product for a great price!"" —Elizabeth L. Blackwell Price: $13.97 (available in seven colors) Promising review: ""We live just 300 yards from the beach and we go through beach towels quickly. We use them, visiting family and friends use them, and we use them around the pool. So many of the 'tourist' towels really don't stand up to the wear, but these do...they are actual towels and not beachfront souvenirs! Absorbent and soft the colors stay vibrant; they're great towels."" —Dr.L. Price: $47.99+ (available in 10 color combinations and in a 24-pack) Promising review: ""Very loose and flowy, fabric is light but not see-through, just soft. I like the flow to it and love the print. I have been eyeing similar dresses online and this one is such a great value compared to those."" —Ram Sam Price: $36.99+ (available in sizes XS–XXL and 32 colors) If you're trying to figure out how many you'll need, each rack holds ~roughly~ 50 hangers.  Promising review: ""I grew tired of throwing my empty hangers into a pile in my closet. They would get all tangled up and really frustrated the heck out of me every time I had to put away clothes! This hanger stacker seemed like an easy solution and boy, was I right! It assembles really easily (just two screws and an Allen wrench) and it is good at keeping my hangers organized. Buy one — you won't regret it!"" —Bubbles456  Price: $24.73 Promising review: ""The BEST sunscreen I have ever used! I am always prone to burn whenever I get out in the sun. I decided to take a trip to the beach this summer and just went kayaking for four hours on the water in the BEAMING sun and in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY. I put sunscreen everywhere except for my chest. Wanna know where my skin is resembling that of a cherry? My chest. The rest of me? TANNING WITH NO BURN WHATSOEVER!!! I was shocked. I love this product and will forever recommend it for the rest of my life. Stay safe and stay unaffected from the sun, you guys!!!"" —Channing C.  Price: $9.60 Promising review: ""I had had it with my broken basic mop and bucket. I tried to just get a dollar store Swiffer to get us by, but that wasn't cutting it at all. With three boys and a dog that makes his rounds on all the furniture and every exposed corner, I had to do something. After seeing a TikTok where a woman demonstrated this mop to clean her walls, and hearing my boss raving about it, I decided to click the Amazon button. Let me tell you, I HATE cleaning, I HATE mopping, but I LOVE for things to be clean. I was able to mop the entire house TWICE (because it was that dirty — please don't judge) within an hour. A few days later I mopped the entire house again within 10 minutes because they weren't quite as dirty. On another positive note, my boys love the spinner and think it’s a toy! So, every time I get the bucket out my 10-year-old and 4-year-old ask to mop the house because they think it’s fun. MAJOR BONUS!"" —Molly Price: $34.41 Promising review: ""These were perfect for my trip to Kauai. The beach we were near had hidden rocks in the sand — big volcanic rocks that hurt to step on, except for me in my fancy shoes. I wore them almost constantly for a week and they held up great under all kinds of stress. I'd totally buy them again. I only wish I had ordered them for everyone in my group."" —The Vincents Price: $7.99+ (available in women's sizes 4–13.5, men's sizes 3–12, and 43 designs) I'm definitely going to sushi jail for this, but I've started putting peanut butter in my avocado rolls. Don't knock it until you try it. Anyway, each kit comes with two sushi rolling mats, five pairs of chopsticks, a paddle, a spreader, and a PDF of instructions, including recipes for six popular rolls.  Promising review: ""The entire Bamboo Sushi Kit is well-made, easy to use, clean, high-end restaurant quality, and durable. It was nicely packaged, and the instructions were clear, in-depth, and easy to follow. No one (myself included) in my household has ever made sushi before but (thanks to the enclosed instructions), no issues were making it. My daughter did an awesome job utilizing these products to make 'FISH-FREE SUSHI' with Pickled Ginger on top, which was delectable! Finally, I highly recommend this set. It comes at a small cost but don't let that deter you — the quality and overall aforementioned features is undoubtedly above and beyond excellent, thus (IMO), it is the perfect product! Love it!"" —Liza  Price: $9.99 Promising review: ""I truly get a lot of compliments! They look expensive and if you have a round face like me these are definitely a must-have. GET THEM."" —YuriZevahc Price: $11.95+ (available in 18 colors) Promising review: ""You don't understand. TikTok made me obsess over this microphone. As a 30+ year-old woman, I resisted purchasing it. I finally broke down and bought it because it haunted me in my sleep. I'm so glad I did. When I am in a bad mood, I start karaoke at home and instantly get better. It has 'ruined' my teenage son's life because my performances can be heard through his Xbox microphone. This is a must-have product."" —Zane A. Undercoffer Price: $29.99 (available in 14 colors) Promising review: ""Every busy family needs this. We use it to carry our sports equipment, beach gear, and even our two young kids (1- and 3-years-old). The wheels are very sturdy. We've used it over grass and gravel, and it rolls without issue. The handle also extends out and it locks securely in place when not used. The whole cart also folds and unfolds easily and isn't too heavy when loading in and out of the car. I've seen this in stores, but it was a much better price here. Definitely recommend."" —Jheneya Price: $96.59+ (available in five colors) Back To The Roots is a California-based small business founded by two college friends that specializes in indoor gardening kits with a mission to reconnect families to food. Psst — if you have not put mushrooms in your air fryer, my friend, you have not yet lived the full human experience. Also this growing kit comes with some recipes to get you started!  Promising review: ""This product has been so much fun to watch! I followed the directions, exactly as written, and the mushrooms began growing within 3–4 days. I will say that I did soak them for close to 10 hours before putting them back in the box to grow and I believe this helped a ton. I also kept the box inside by a window with the blinds closed in order for them to get indirect sunlight. The mushrooms grew tremendously for almost a week before they started to shrink so I clipped them to cook with and they were DELICIOUS! This was such a fun product and process to watch. I am now in the process of trying to get a second batch of shrooms from the same box. Fingers crossed!"" —Steph A Price: $13.99+ (available in five varieties) Promising review: ""Better than the best! Yes, we did purchase it to clean the rugs in our motorhome, and it reliably cleans them like new. Beyond rugs, try it for clothing spots, as it's better than those stocked on grocery store shelves and leaves zero residue. Blot the moisture out, let dry, and it's ready to wear. If you have pets, order the large size, which you'll find indispensable. It doesn't take much to do the job, just a little spritzing; wait a few moments, and rub with a clean rag or towel for rugs. My order included two bottles; I loaned one to a friend to try and now she won't give it back."" —Sharon l. smith Price: $6.65+ (also available in multiple packs) Promising review: ""I had one of these in my other home in the laundry closet. Loved it and the fact it folds back to the wall when not in use. Not shabbily made. Grateful to be able to order another one without having to go into some brick-and-mortar store. I highly recommend it for any closet, bathroom to hang clothes to dry, or laundry room. I would give 10 stars if that option were available."" —BullCityNana Price: $9.98 Check out how they work on TikTok here! And PS: Wonder Hanger is a small biz! Promising review: ""I wish I had taken the time to take a before and after pic because I have so much more room in there now than I did before. I found the cutest tops in there that I had completely forgotten about because my clothes were crammed in the closet so tightly. Most of the time, I felt like I had nothing to wear, LOL, and now, I know exactly what I have, and it's even organized by sleeve length and color. I would definitely buy again and actually plan to buy more for my husband and children to use as well."" —Mariko Lamb Price: $13.99+ (available in two colors and packs of 10 or 24) The objective of the game is to collect matching sets of cards faster than everyone else, which earns you points — but if you happen to be armed with one of the foam burritos and aim it at someone before they can dodge, you can knock their points out (and distract them from finding other matches). The game includes a few other niche rules to keep everyone on their toes, and is good for ages 7 and up and for 2–6 players.  Promising review: ""So...I can’t even begin to describe this game 😂. I’m 32, my husband 38, and our children are 14 and 11. We ALL love this! Make sure to take your glasses off before playing if you wear them. 😂 You’ll have bruises. You’ll break things. You’ll yell. It will be the most fun you’ve had in a long time. If you drink and aren’t playing with children, I imagine it would be even more fun! This isn’t hard to play and there aren’t many rules and I love how it doesn’t really matter if you cheat because no one cares as long as you get to throw a burrito. If you have dogs, watch your burritos because they look like fun dog toys and will disappear with a quickness. Just buy this, you’ll have the most innocent fun you’ve had in years!"" —Amazon Customer Price: $24.99 Each kit includes four types of organic seeds (Rocky Mountain Bristlecone Pine, Black Poui, Norway Spruce, and Flame Tree), four biodegradable growing pots, four expanding-soil discs, four bamboo plant markers, one bonsai clipper, and an instruction booklet.  Promising review: ""I love this. My bonsai has already sprouted and it's coming along nicely. The best thing about this product is the customer service. They actually take an interest in how things are going and are willing to help you through anything. They respond personally, no form letters, and they give heartfelt responses to your questions and comments. This is definitely one of my best purchases."" —G Eckberg Price: $19.99 Check out a TikTok of the remote page turner in action.  Psst — a lot of reviewers like to pair this with a gooseneck tablet holder so it'll stay upright in front of them without having to hold it!  Promising review: ""This product makes reading so damn convenient. It’s so easy to hold that you can strap it onto your wrist so you don’t misplace it when using it. So far, the battery life has been spectacular. I just mirror my iPad screen to my TV, make the font size hysterically large, get under my covers, and just click away. I don’t have to move a muscle. I don’t know why I didn’t buy this sooner. I’m so obsessed. This is a must-have for anyone who reads from a Kindle or iPad. Just cocoon yourself under your blankets and enjoy your book without having to stick a hand out into the cold to turn the page. It sounds lazy, but trust me, once you have a clicker, you won’t know what to do without one."" —Jessica Price: $33.99 Promising review: ""This is sturdy and lightweight. This closet rod doubled my available space in seconds. There is plenty of space on the top rod for longer shirts and tops and shorter ones fit perfectly on the lower rod without touching the floor. Plus, hangers stay in place and don't slide to one end or the other based on how heavy items are, and so far the rod hasn't sagged or bowed at all. And I have all my sweatshirts and heavy fleece jackets on the bottom rod. Space will obviously depend on the height of the closet rod you hang this from, but I would highly recommend this for anyone with need of more closet space!!"" —CCBunE Price: $15.28 Each kit comes with clear written instructions and access to video tutorials to make over 100 different kinds of slime, from unicorn slime to glitter slime to fluffy cloud slime to floam putty. You can personalize the colors, textures, add-ins, *and* the smell — the box comes with beads, scents, glitter, ink, foam balls, the ingredients needed to make the slime, and containers to keep it in.  Promising review: ""Purchased for daughter's birthday. She loves it. I was very apprehensive about letting her use slime but it has everything a parent could dream of to keep it all in one place and organized without the mess!"" —Jay Price: $26.99+ (available in two varieties) Promising review: ""These were perfect for the hot tub. We have a hot tub that we use 3–5 days a week, and the grandchildren love to come over and go in the hot tub; they love playing Uno, so this game is perfect to do in the hot tub with a little floating table (separate purchase) — it’s perfect."" —Kimberly A Gearhart Jr Price: $14.24 Promising review: ""I was heartbroken when my antique (1929) liquor table got these huge water marks on it. I did a lot of searching for ways to remove the spots but nothing worked. I saw this product and figured I’d give it a try. The marks are GONE after maybe 5–10 minutes of rubbing this miracle cloth on my table. I’m over-the-moon happy!” —Kim R  Price: $6.85 Promising review: ""I’ve bought these shoes several times and they have never disappointed! I am a nurse so I rely heavily on good footwear to get through the day and not be in pain. These shoes are cheaper than most, and they are so comfy! They are a little snug when brand new but once they’re broken in it really is like walking on a cloud."" —Jenna Price: $58.99+ (available in sizes 5–11 and 18 colors) Promising review: ""This is my favorite summer dress [right now] — so soft, and comfortable, and too cute. Omg and it has pockets. 😍"" —Melissa Shipp Price: $29.99 (available in sizes S–5XL and 47 colors) Promising review: ""I got my senior dog food made for senior dogs. It’s easy to eat. So he started eating it so fast he would almost choke. He would look at me all hunched over and in pain in the middle of eating and I would panic. So I decided to get this bowl. He honestly isn’t a big fan of it. Because he likes things to be easy for him (he is spoiled in all other aspects of his life). But I like it because he is not eating so fast he is gonna choke. But now he just takes his time and lays down to eat. I’m happy with it! Great purchase!"" —Destiny Hamman Price: $9.99+ (available in three sizes and 10 colors) If you watch Shark Tank, then this product may look familiar to you!

They contour well in your hand and hold the aromatic flavor and color of your beverage as you incorporate your receptors of smell and taste."" —Chad Herbert Get a set of four from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in three styles, as well as in sets of two).  It offers high-speed 15W charging that's backed by Qi2 certification and compatible with MagSafe. It's super lightweight too — just under 7 ounces! Promising review: ""I had another wireless charger before that didn’t charge at the fullest speed, this one works PERFECTLY. It’s light and easy for me to travel with. Would recommend if you have AirPods, an Apple Watch, and travel a lot."" —Erica Ahumada Get it from Amazon for $109.99 (available in white or black). My coworker Emma Lord owns these and raves: ""I love them to pieces, TBH, I use them as decor every bit as much as I use them to eat."" You can read more of her lightsaber chopsticks review (it's #14).  Promising review: ""Bought these for a white elephant and everyone loved them! My friends are huge Star Wars fans and absolutely love these chopsticks. Great color quality and great LED light quality. They're well made, easy to clean, and a nice weight! Would recommend for sure, very fun and cute gift!"" —Sam Get it from Amazon for $9.99+  (available in seven colors and in multipacks). Promising review: ""Bose is as good as it gets. These over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones are outstanding. I love my music. Absolutely have strict boundaries for myself when it comes to speakers, earbuds, headphones, etc. These are extremely comfortable, the noise canceling is outstanding, and the sound is, well, Bose. They have excellent, crisp highs and the low-end bass is not overpowering, it's just a killer sounding bass. Get these headphones. You won't regret it."" –Edward T. Get them from Amazon for $379 (available in three colors ). Promising reviews: ""We bought this for my husband for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. We are a Marvel-loving household so it fit right in. My husband is a contractor so he has all the tools but it is perfect to have in the house when I ask him to hang a shelf, a picture, or whatever. It has lots of handy tools inside, my husband was impressed with the quality of each tool and the variety. Plus he feels cool holding Thor's hammer, haha."" —Monica Aldrich ""My husband is extremely difficult to buy for. I end up trying to buy him functional funny stuff. This was actually well made and he thought it was pretty clever. He drags it out when someone needs help. Gets a good giggle."" —Tatorie79 Get it from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in two styles). It's vegan and gluten free! Promising review: ""When you’re older and look back on life, there are special moments that stand out — graduating college, getting married, having a child, or getting promoted to name a few. After tasting the Hotter Sauce, I immediately knew that this was going to be one of those moments. Now I know what many of you are thinking — NO WAY — it can’t be that good. The cold hard truth is that it is! Hotter Sauce is a culinary experience, unlike anything else. Seriously, have a life-changing moment and try the Hotter Sauce!"" —Blake Driver Get it from Amazon for $13.49+ (available in two sizes, in black or white truffle flavors, in ""hot"" and ""hotter"" spice levels, and in multipacks). Promising review: ""Yes it's easy to clean, and easy to use blah, blah, blah, anyway buy this tap if you desire straight from the pub texture in your beer, unlike countertop kergerators that need C02 or a 5-liter minikeg (not sold in America anymore cause Heineken / Busch 😭) to deliver your beer. This takes your already refrigerated cold beer from bottle to glass, BUT tops it off with that nice thick foam head like you'd get at a decent pub/bar. Yes you could use it with other carbonated drinks, but let's be honest: You bought this for beer, and if you're an enthusiast/connoisseur like anyone else looking at this, you know why you're buying this countertop tap."" —OV3RTKI11 Get it from Amazon for $124.99. Promising review: ""This really is a great product. It’s reasonably priced, well built, and thoughtfully packaged. I think it looks great with basically any decor. It works perfectly to easily store and display a few records for easy access. Simple design, great form and function. Highly recommended."" —lawn_wrangler Get it from Amazon for $27.99 (also available in natural wood and vintage brown). Other cool features include a quiet motor and the ability to be charged up on the go, thanks to a USB-type charger that works with a power bank, phone adapter, and 5v/2a adapter.  Promising review: ""This massage gun has been really fun for our family. My wife has struggled with pain in her hips and gluteal area for years. We have used this in the evenings frequently and definitely noticed pain relief. I have used it after a good hard workout and also noticed that I am not as sore. Also, we have been very impressed with the battery life. We can both use it quite a bit and not have to charge it for days."" —Brent Get it from Amazon for $69.99 (available in three colors). It can be used in the oven and on the grill! Cast Elegance is a small biz founded by two pizza lovers who set out to make the best pizza stone for enjoying restaurant-quality slices at home.  Promising review: ""I can’t believe we lived this long without a pizza stone. This one is just the charm. In fact, it’s going to be bought again as Christmas gifts. Changes the entire way we enjoy a pizza. No more half-baked crust. No more chewy mess. Just a lovely crispy baked thru top-to-bottom pizza. Great product. A must have for any kitchen."" —D. Ojanpera Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes). This kit includes a beard wash, beard balm, beard conditioning oil, and a full beard detangler.  Promising review: ""My wife gave me this beard maintenance kit as a Christmas present and I fell in love with it after the first use. The scent is awesome and my wife and kids like it as well. I’ve tried many of the expensive brands that show commercial actors looking like Vikings or lumberjacks offering beard maintenance kits for $125 (each) and higher, even. This one is a fraction of the price, smells better than the overhyped competition, and does a much better job at keeping my beard looking amazingly maintained. No alcohol in the ingredients! Over the years I’ve easily spent over $3,000 in beard maintenance products, this one takes the lead by far. Even if it were the same price as the competition, this one would be my go-to brand. If you were considering buying the more expensive and popular brands, I urge you to please consider this brand for beard maintenance. I assure you, you’re going to be grateful you did. My hair is very frizzy. This product has conditioned my facial hair better than it’s ever been, since I began wearing a beard in 2012. I hope this review helps my fellow beard-bros out! This one performs better for a fraction of the cost. Best of luck!"" —Raf Get it from Amazon for $45.99.  Bear Paw Products is a US-based small business established in 1993 that specializes in grilling tools and accessories.  Promising review: ""If you make any meals where you need pulled pork or beef, then these are for you. I was amazed at the ease of use and how much time I saved (a LOT!!) vs. using a pair of forks. Highly recommend!!!."" —David Kennedy Get a pair from Amazon for $14.99 (available in four colors).  BuzzFeed Shopping editor Heather Braga says: ""My husband is the real gamer in this family and he loves his HyperX Alloy keyboard. The brand allows you to choose which kind of key switch you prefer to game with — for lack of a better term, this is a game changer. The red switches are more linear, the aqua switches are more tactile, and the blue switches are more click-y."" Promising review: ""I had no idea a keyboard could be this amazing. Disclaimer, yes I'm a first-time mechanical user switching from a standard Logitech membrane. I tried this HyperX board next. And wow! The typing feels like nothing I've ever experienced. I got the aqua switches. The software opens and is pretty much self-explanatory. I already started making macros for Photoshop and making certain keys different colors so they stand out. And one more 'wow' for the brightness and clarity. This is so awesome. I'm hooked."" —David Soumis Get it from Amazon for $79.99+ (available in four sizes and three types of key switches).

Easy to connect to the phone and great sound quality. My husband loves it and now I am using it as well!""—Andra Gabriella Get it from Amazon for $19.99. Promising review: ""I don't normally leave reviews, but I was so pleased with this product I feel I have to share. I bought the Wekapo inflatable air sofa as a gift for my husband to use for our week at the beach (he likes to nap on the beach). However, he hardly got a chance to use it because the friends we went with, as well as myself, couldn't keep ourselves off of it! Super comfortable, easy to inflate, didn't seem to lose air pressure. I was also surprised the fabric didn't get hot in the sunlight. Everyone loved it and I have a feeling many will be purchasing their own. I think it will work great in other environments as well, can't wait to take it on trips with us, or just hang out on the back deck on it! 100% would purchase again, and will probably purchase a couple of others to have at the house because it's a great price. Thanks Wekapo!"" —Grace Screeney Get it from Amazon for $38.98 (available in 18 colors/patterns). TotalMount is a small biz that specializes in mounting solutions for various electronic devices.

Love the gold leafing, adds a a touch of quality to the overall book. Highly recommend getting it if you’re into comics, Marvel, or Spider-Man."" —Nox Get it from Amazon for $16.59+ (available in paperback or hardcover).  Promising review: ""We got this for my dad and our whole family absolutely loves it! We have had so much fun playing it — as a competitive family who loves all types of trivia (history, sports, etc), we have had a blast with all of the trivia categories!"" —Cp Get it from Amazon for $20.15. Promising review: ""I've purchased this many times for both myself, and as gifts for others. It's def one one of my favorite designer fragrances. As a collector and connoisseur of high-end niche fragrances, this is right up there with some of the ones I really enjoy. A great value for the dollar, truly. Highly recommend. If you want to get into the scent profile and notes, look it up on Fragrantica...excellent reviews on there."" —William Cobb Get it from Amazon for $33.53+ (available in 20 scents, six sizes, and as a gift set).  Promising review: ""Such a simple idea, how is this just coming into my life now? I didn't think showers could get any better but now I have a brew/wine within reach at all times. Really helps take the edge off after a long day. The thing is way sturdier than you'd expect, I've tugged on it and it's not going anywhere. The slotted design allows you to use stemmed wine glasses, too. A truly perfect product. This piece of plastic is working as hard as my therapist and I stan."" —Steven Get it from Amazon for $13.95+ (available in six styles).  Don't forget the AA batteries! Promising review: ""OMG, this milk frother makes my homemade latte taste like it was made by a barista. It was perfect. So perfect that I bought a second one for my brother who loves coffee to use. I've already recommended it to some coworkers. It has changed my coffee-drinking life. This comes highly recommended."" —Michelle Get it from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in 42 colors/styles).

Promising review: ""I think I just found the best ice cream scoop ever! I was very surprised when I took it out of the box because it has some weight to it, so I knew right away that it would not break easily. It scoops ice cream beautifully and is dishwasher safe. I am so glad TikTok made me buy this!"" —Ashley Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 18 colors and a two-pack).  Promising reviews: ""Had my dad cackling!

This actually works."" —Ben Get it from Amazon for $9.80.  Purity is a small business that specializes in tech products and accessories.  Promising review: ""I've tried soooo many different types of earbuds over the years with no success. But these Purity open-air headphones are the first pair I've ever tried that actually fit well, don't hurt, and sound great! So, after many years of trying, I've FINALLY found the right ones for my ears!! Woohoo!

And I HATE digging into the old pill boxes or doing the tip over. I don't know what it is, but i have always disliked it. I hung this on my wall right by the kitchen so I pass it like 5,000 times a day and I can't not see it. It is so fun pushing the little orange button to watch the meds fall out. I mean it kind of feels like a really weird game of Wheel of Fortune, but I like it."" —Grofica Get it from Amazon for $35.99.  Promising review: ""LOVE this. I no longer forget to put on sunscreen as this is part of my new routine. Love the shimmer (much more than anticipated), especially on my arms and legs.

It's in my bathroom and is a lovely addition. It turns off the second the lights go on which is nice that I don't have to worry about accidentally leaving it on. Super cute and the little itty-bitty lighting element does a good job lighting, just enough so I don't have to turn the main lights on in the middle of the night."" —1Thand Get it from Amazon for $5.99.   Promising review: ""I am obsessed with this funnel!!! I juice a lot of citrus and juices for cocktails, and this little guy is the perfect size for bottling. It’s beyond cute and really great quality.

I feel like it is very gentle on my face. My skin feels amazing after I wash it off. It feels like I used moisturizer, even though I did not. I hear that these masks are very popular in Japan."" —LizaB Get it from Amazon for 	$9.56. Promising review: ""I ordered this lamp because of its appearance. I didn't NEED a depressed duck lamp ... but it has totally filled a void in my life I didn't know existed. Everyone who sees it pokes it. The lamp is actually very functional. It's got a really nice set of brightness options, and the glow is yellowish, which is much nicer than white in a dim/dark room. One thing that isn't mentioned in the description is that its legs are utterly floppy. It's terrific."" —Literated Get it from Amazon for $14.39 (available in three styles).  It includes a chef's knife, paring knife, bread knife, slicing knife, utility knife, and santoku knife.

Yeah, I've had sharper, better-quality knives in the past, but for hundreds of dollars more. For basic kitchen use, this is the set to buy. I like that they're colorful because I've already been able to familiarize myself with which knife is which color and what I need to use them for. I haven't had to sharpen them yet, and I've been using them pretty steadily for about a month. I wouldn't have a problem spending $40–$50 for these knives."" —GWP Get a set of six knives with covers from Amazon for $16.98.

Ran out of 'The Ordinary' hyaluronic acid I’ve been using for a year and no stores close sold it so I gave this a try. So glad I did because it’s a thousand times better!! I put it on first, then moisturizer after I put on my primer and makeup and it looks the best it’s ever looked. My pores were smaller in just three days and my skin so hydrated. I have combo skin son my 'T' zone gets awfully oily. The fix is to make sure your skin is hydrated. Also the bottle is twice the size of 'The Ordinary'! This does it all!!! So very impressed."" —smnthfinch Get it from Amazon for $8.05.   Promising review: ""The quality is amazing. Bright white, ceramic! I loved them so much I ordered another set!

Does it go with my farmhouse decor? Nope, not at all. But it does get the attention of two teenage boys. Had I gone with something a bit more my decor style, I can guarantee you it would not be as useful. I mean, we all would much rather see Prison Mike staring back at us than suit and tie Michael Scott, right? And there is only one way for that to happen...clean out the dishwasher!"" —R. Funk Get it from Amazon for $8.99. Promising review: ""So, yes, TikTok made me buy this, but so far I really like it. It's obviously very adorable and offers a charming spot to keep my keys that works with my entryway. I'm really surprised by how strong the hold is for such a small object — I carry my car fob and a few keys and so far it's holding strong. I hung it with command strips to avoid any potential damage to the wall and I will say make sure it's level as the hold is not so good on an angle (but that was from the original in-hand testing). Definitely recommend and for the price, I'm very tempted to get one for my at-work office."" —D. Carter  Get it from Amazon for $7.48.  Poketo is a small business established in 2003 that specializes in design-conscious goods.  Promising review: ""My white office walls needed some color, and this totally rocks!

I use this daily as a nightlight and bought one for my cousin to use when she gets up to breastfeed. They come in different colors. The timer keeps it on for one hour if you want it to shut off on its own, and it is easy to charge. I want other colors but have no business filling my house with light-up gummy bears."" —Christina Lucia Williams Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in seven colors).  Promising review: ""This thermometer not only works perfectly, but is a great conversation starter at gatherings! I've used it a few times now and am completely satisfied with the purchase. It is accurate, and the display is super easy to read.

I knew right then I had to make these at home and ordered these while at the restaurant. These are easy to fill and have rubber snaps that lock them tight.

I have already ordered more as my friends all want these in their drinks!"" —Siri US Get it from Amazon for $7.99.  Check out a TikTok of the snail teabag holder in action. Promising review: ""Love these fun little quirky tea slugs.

It’s a unique looking light. I love how it has three different settings so you can adjust the brightness. It fits perfectly with my reading chaise and goes well with the rest of my living room decor.

It just hangs off the handle of my Doona. [I even use it for] a small diapering bag and I'm good to go, since the Doona stroller/carseat has no storage basket.

I just moved into a new apartment and I didn’t want to be how I used to be, where I’d just let hair go down the drain and plug it eventually, or peel it off of the drain after each shower. It works great but I probably need some practice with it. I currently just floss my hair through it so it will hold them and there are a few stray hairs that don’t stick. I would recommend to anyone who is tired of putting your loose strands of hair on the shower wall."" —Cari Schwartzkopf Get it from Amazon for $14.95.  Britt's Highlights is a Florida-based Etsy shop established in 2021 that specializes in unique hair accessories.  Promising review: ""This hair clip is adorable.

I get so many compliments on these!! Just bought some for my sister and mom, they love them so much.

If you're thinking about buying this...do it!"" —Michelle Maroon Get it from Amazon for $19.99.  Promising review: ""This is a great spoon rest, but an even greater conversation piece for anyone who walks by the stove. 'Is that a giant ravioli on your stove?' 'OMG, no, it's just my adorable spoon rest!' Jealousy ensues. You get the idea. Also, it keeps the stove clean(er), and everything washes off of the spoon rest quite easily."" —Melissa McMahon Get it from Amazon for $17.45.  Promising review: ""This has been in use at our house for about a year now.

What else do you want?!?! 😂"" —deborah Get it from Amazon for $11.95 (available in nine styles).  Promising review: ""Hands down, one of the coolest and cutest kitchen gadgets I own. I bought this pitter because my father is a HUGE bing cherry fan. When cherry season is in, you can guarantee he'll be sitting in his recliner with a bowl full of cherries. He normally eats cherries and pits them in his mouth, but in his older age, I worried about him cracking a tooth or choking on the pit. So I bought this pitter and it was an INSTANT hit! He loved how cute it was and the pitter does an amazing job. Easy to use, not a ton of force needed, and then the pits are in one place and easy to throw away!"" —cocade27 Get it from Amazon for $17.99.  Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."

The bright colors, the sturdiness and the very easy setup. It took myself and my sister in law about five minutes to setup. I put this hammock in my backyard, had some visitors for a couple of weeks and they used it very very regularly, to read, sleep, and just lounge. The only thing that may bother some people is that when lying in it the sides come over and wrap you like a cocoon. But I love it!!"" —Juliet, Florida Get it from Amazon for $64.99+ (available in 17 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""I purchased these to cover the side of my house. Installation was easy and I left them outside for two days to charge. The light coverage was about what I expected from them and do the job well. The motion sensitivity covers all the side and lights turn on. It has rained about three times and still work great and hoping they last for a long time."" —J. Argueta Get a set of four from Amazon for $32.99.  Promising review: ""These are incredible!! I like using the color feature in winter when it's drab outside, but once my gardens bloom, I stick to white. I have purchased these five times, and it's going to be six.

They are beautiful!!"" —mosey  Get an eight-pack from Amazon for $42.29.  Promising review: ""This stuff is a miracle! I know it says patch repair but we had an entire bare backyard that needed tending to. I mixed two bags of this stuff with a 2-lb bag of grass seed and of course raked the yard and tilled to over turn the dirt, spread this stuff and watered 2–3 times a day lightly. I even forgot about it one day and still to my surprise I had nice grass growing all throughout the backyard. Our backyard is very shady so I didn’t expect these great of results we also have a dog that runs around the yard constantly barking at airplanes and people who walk by.

Promising review: ""It will kill any flying insects like mosquitoes, gnats, flies, horse flies, fruit flies, house flies, moths, bees, wasps, and pretty much anything else that's flying around lol! I use this anywhere it's dark. It has a blue-violet light that attracts flying insects, and the voltage electric grid zaps them on contact, you can hear them being zapped and you're like yes! I like that I don't have to put up with the smell and mess of those nasty sprays that take your breath away and leave a big mess behind. I also don't have to worry about all my little pets and kids smelling that spray.  ""It's so lightweight and easy to use; you can hang it everywhere you like. It doesn't have to warm up and starts working when plugged in. I love it ZAP! The best part is it's easy to clean, when the dead bugs fall onto the tray you just use the brush that's provided. The bulb is replaceable, so if it starts being less effective at attracting flying buys, you can replace it and the bugs will continue ZAPPING. This is a good buy. 💯"" —Maija solaja Get it from Amazon for $39.98. Promising review: ""Got an outdoor can, the kind the mechanical arm on the garbage truck picks up and tips over, with the lid opening by gravity. Placed this on the inside of the lid, near the hinge to lessen the chances of it being scraped off during emptying and no flies/maggots! No apparent odor, just seems to put a big hurt on the fly party that used to be my trash can (litter box contents, remnants of meat, etc)."" —Michael E. Bradley Get it from Amazon for $9.84.

Promising review: “We bought this for a rather large umbrella over our table in the back yard, and used it for the first time last night. We were less concerned about mosquitoes because we have a service to eliminate them — it's the bees that were disturbing our outdoor meals and events. My wife hosted a few friends last night, and they all fell in love with this. They've all been fighting with bees lately, and they were not bothered once by any bugs. Every friend bought the netting on the spot. Also, when you're inside the netting sitting on chairs, it's almost as if the netting is invisible; most of the time you can't tell whether it's even there, especially at night.” —Sara Olshanky Get it from Amazon for $35.95+ (available in two colors and a version with LED lights). You can learn more about BTI, the bacteria in mosquito dunks, at the CDC. Promising review: ""Mosquitoes where I live are fierce! For the first time in years I have been able to enjoy hanging out in my beautiful backyard, which is full of trees and flowers. Why? Because I put out six containers of water with one Mosquito Dunk disk each. There are no more mosquitoes! This product is a miracle. The dunks are extremely simple to use and cost hardly anything. They last a month. Completely efficient. I will use this for the rest of my life. Thank you to whoever figured this out!"" —Alberta Get a two-pack from Amazon for $8.03.

It will keep your household entertained anytime you go outside."" —Angelina ""Fun for grownups, too! We purchased this for our little grandchildren to enjoy and then discovered that with the high load capacity, we could swing with them, too! The product is sturdy, was easy to assemble, hang, and adjust the lengths of the ropes. It’s a great addition to our front yard and immediately became a neighborhood kid magnet, too! It’s only been up for a couple of weeks but has enjoyed hours of playtime."" —Richard S Get it from Amazon for $44.99. The tool-free installation is as simple as opening the unit and camping it onto the umbrella pole. It requires four AA batteries to run, which are not included.  Promising review: ""This light is great!!! It has three settings to adjust the amount of brightness you need. Lowest level is great for just sitting around your patio table and having a couple of drinks with friends. Brightest setting is PERFECT for playing cards! We play cards a few times a month. There are two 70+ year-olds who did not complain that they couldn’t see. So, works great in my book! 😁"" —Mandie Jordan Get it from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: ""This has been the most loved purchase in my household so far this summer. Temperatures are reaching 100 in Georgia now and this makes it much more bearable to spend time outside.

We will be using this especially during the summer as it pretty much stay in the triple digits here (the Mojave Desert). I cannot believe it took less than 10 minutes to bake an entire pizza. I recommend that you go to the KettlePizza website to get pointers from some of the celebrity chefs that they have videos of. These pointers really did help me to cook a perfect pizza!"" —Kim Suzanne  Get it from Amazon for $144.95. Promising review: ""I must say, I was a bit skeptical when I first purchased this, but after setting it up, I was absolutely amazed. I hooked it up just outside the back door at our main house, and I have incredible service in the garage apartment. Can run all computers, TV. It really is a wonderful device and definitely worth the money!"" —Texas  Get it from Amazon for $34.99.  Promising reviews: ""We have a neighbor who keeps her Christmas light on year-round. This gives us privacy on our patio but it doesn’t completely block, which is fine with us. I love the idea that I can plant my garden."" —Sandy912 ""I normally hate assembling things but the instructions were so clear and the pieces fit so perfectly, it really was a breeze. The screen is well-made and sturdy. I hung flower pots on it as well as putting pots in the bottom. It’s holding up extremely well to the four or five times a week the flowers get watered. Hasn’t tipped or moved despite some recent high winds. Very happy with the look and quality!"" —Lynn L.

It definitely provides enough privacy, and it gives the backyard a very nice ambiance! The leaves completely blend in with the other trees and plants we have in the backyard, and it looks like we made a huge upgrade in our gardening game. I'm now just hoping it can withstand the AZ summer and not fade with the sun (product description does state fade resistant). Don't be hesitant with purchasing; it's totally worth it!!"" —Amazon Customer Get a roll from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in three sizes). You'll need some green zip ties to secure them, too.

Promising review: ""I have to admit, it took a few weeks for the hummingbirds to find this feeder, but now that they visit it frequently, this beautiful feeder is a source of continual joy. Easy to use, lovely to look at on its own, and a true wonder to watch the hummingbirds feed a few inches away. The perspective this feeder offers is wondrous. I have already purchased one for a friend who lives in a much more wooded region and she had hummingbirds feeding at it faster than I did. It's artsy, easy, genius and fun!"" —Tristram Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in two finishes). Since these are solar-powered, you'll need to place them in the sun to get them to light up.

When I opened the box and pulled it out, I thought it was bit small and surely wouldn't be that loud... BOY, WAS I WRONG!! This FREAKING ROCKS!!! Seriously don't hesitate — BUY ONE! The reviews were spot on! Perfect poolside! Best money I've ever spent on a Bluetooth speaker. The wife was skeptical, and then, I turned it on, and she was like, wow, excellent purchase, way to go!"" —RIC78 Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in 10 colors/styles). Promising review: ""It is early July, and I could not be more pleased with this seed mixture. Almost every day since April, I have had new surprises in my garden. I have enjoyed alyssum, Chinese forget-me-not, zinnias, cosmos, and marigolds. I am beginning to see more forget-me-nots, poppies, pineapple sage, and Armeria. I am a beekeeper and, hence, was trying to plant some flowers the bees would like. I have an unbelievable number of pollinators busy among the flowers all day long. Today, I saw a hummingbird!! I am hoping to have these flowers self-seed and to have even more lovelies next year!"" —Bio Teacher Get it from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in two sizes and as annuals or perennials).  Promising review: ""I bought this cat tent because our two fur babies will sit in the window and cry if we are outside. I tried a leash, but they didn't like that, and they often escaped it. I came across this tent, and it was the BEST purchase I made. The quality is great! Both cats fit in it, so the size is perfect. Very excited that this is actually a product for the cats!!!"" —hgrizz Get it from Amazon for $21.99 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""This is an outdoor blanket, so I didn’t expect it to be super soft, but it really is very nice. Excellent quality.

Highly recommend because it looks really good."" —Cathy  Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in 12 colors).  It also folds down completely for storage! Promising review: ""This is great for the garden. Keeps my knees out of the stickers, and the padding is very comfortable, helps me get up and down — easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. Haven't tried sitting on it, but i'm heavy, and this feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary."" —Cpt Dragon Get it from Amazon for $32.99. It has two large entrance doors and even internal hooks for hanging coats and bags. Promising review: ""It keeps cold wind and leaves out and some heat in. There are zip vents at top to let in fresh air and two zipper doors. This has extended the season for hot tub use, we were able to set up in early March in Chicago area.

BuzzFeed Staff Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products.  Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action.  Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $8.99.  Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products.  This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (although TBH, if this list of bugs gets any longer I may just stay indoors forever!!).  Promising review: ""I cannot stress to you enough how much better this simple little tool has made my quality of life during summer in Ohio. It rains a lot. There are a lot of mosquitoes. I have horrific allergic reactions to mosquito bites. We're talking bumps swelling to the width of softballs within minutes of the bite. This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY. I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me. If you live anywhere where insect bites are common, you need to own one of these."" —Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.95. Promising review: “If you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I’ve used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!” —Amazon Customer  Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in 16 styles). Promising review: ""I got the khaki for a beach vacation at an upscale family resort, so I wanted to make sure to have something nice enough yet not over the top. This bag is perfect, nice looking, roomy, does not sag, and though it holds its shape, not at all stiff. You can really stuff it. There’s a good size zippered inner pocket for valuables that will protect from sand. It has a modern straw look that is nice enough for beach shops and restaurants. After lots of use, the only thing I did to clean it was to shake it out. It still looks brand new and is ready for next year."" —Yellow Rose of Texas  Get it from Amazon for $12.99 (available in seven colors and in two-packs).  Promising review: ""After enduring the Texas heat and realizing my car lacked backseat vents, I decided to invest in this. This purchase has been nothing short of a game-changer. The fan's 360-degree rotatable design ensures that my 4-year-old receives ample airflow, eliminating any discomfort from the heat. The speed regulation allows me to adjust the fan's intensity according to the day's temperature, and the ease of setup means it's perfectly tailored for any vehicle.

I really dislike putting anything heavy on my face and prefer a gel-like consistency. I am a big fan of the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid serum and the texture of this sunscreen feels pretty close to that.

I work from home and have three monitors. When I leave my desk for lunch, the computer goes to sleep and when I come back, everything is logged out and whatever was on three monitors ends up on two. SO frustrating. This is programmable for three settings and I use it on the minimal movement so when I come back, everything is just as I left it. Revolutionary! Just remember to turn it on!"" —Isaiah Get it from Amazon for $8.99.  Promising review: ""Used for the first time today on my 7-year-old. First time in his life he actually enjoyed having sunscreen applied to his skin! Very easy to use and not messy at all.

Absolutely no more friction and no more going ""OW OW OW"" in the shower because my literal boob wounds were stinging. Promising review: ""This was a TikTok buy and it was worth it. Highly recommend it. It does the work. Long lasting and not sticky at all."" —EBATL Get it from Amazon for $8.99. It fits any phone up to 100 mm x 170 mm (or about 3.9 inches x 6.7 inches). It's also a great fix for keeping out sand and dirt (and a great option for runners, if you're caught in the rain but still want to be able to toggle through your music options).  Promising review: ""I purchased this case in July for an upcoming canoe trip with a friend, and as luck would have it, we flipped our canoe. I just assumed my phone would be discovered a thousand years from now and placed in a museum as an ancient artifact. Fast forward to this week. I was contacted via FB by an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office diver and guess what he found? Yup, my phone case with all of the contents intact and dry as a bone! He had to cut the case open, but there was not one single drop of water in it and he ended up purchasing a case for himself because he was just that impressed!"" —Julie McDonald Here's what BuzzFeeder Elizabeth Lilly has to say about this case: ""With these, I find that they're good for about a day due to condensation. So, for a trip I'll buy two to three. I've used this case to take underwater pics, on boat rides, and have worn it with the lanyard jumping off a boat into water. So, I really trust these!"" Get it from Amazon for $5.59 (available in 14 colors). Promising review: ""Expensive isn't always better. I tried this spray before spending the day outdoors in 90-degree heat at Disneyland, and the only place my makeup moved was on the tip of my nose because I have allergies and use a lot of Kleenex. But otherwise, it looked as fresh as it did when I put it on. I’ve used Mac and Urban Decay setting spray, and they never worked as well as this stuff. I am completely amazed. Definitely give it a try."" —Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $9.90 (also available in dewy and radiant finishes, and a jumbo size, as well as in multipacks). Promising review: ""I used these several times for the past year, traveling for business and leisure. It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag/or small backpack pocket. The portable chargers take about 30–35 minutes to fully charge if dead. Once charged, they charge fast and hold a charge for many hours."" —J Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in eight colors and in two-packs).  Promising review: ""This neck fan is awesome!!!

Promising review: ""First off, if you have extremely oily skin, this. is. it. I was so tired of getting blotting powder/wipes. It felt wasteful and always left residue on my face. I saw this on TikTok and NEEDED it. It was back ordered, but then I got an email saying it was in stock, and I was SO excited. Not only is it affordable, but it's washable, which helps you save money and be less wasteful."" —Kelsey B.

I use this all the time for my coffee from Starbucks, and it is amazing! I'll get iced coffee at 9 a.m. and still have ice in it at 7 p.m. I have many Frost Buddy products now, and their entire line is phenomenal.

This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1x–2x a week. I even use it on my dogs paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of.

I took it out a day later and filled it with Diet Coke just to see what it does. Squeeze it a few times and it's 100% a slushy. I am shocked and thrilled. Worth the money. It has some type of ribbing inside that freezes.

But I didn’t. I love my sodas cold. But sometimes there’s not a cold one available, and waiting 30-40 min for one to get cold in the freezer is not always ideal. This will get your room temp can to fridge cold in 90 seconds. I let it run double that to get almost freezer cold. I wish it had a power cord. But I do appreciate the portability that the batteries provide. I can’t wait to try it out on vacationing, as access to cold sodas isn’t always available.

I woke up today with nice wavy hair, not dry tangled hair. I've been trying to grow out the layer of hair on the top back of my head and it's been so stubborn! Keeps getting tangled and breaks here and there from bleaching and dye damage, but with this new pillow I notice it doesn't tangle, which means it can grow right without rubbing and tangling/pulling!

The waterproof feature keeps the cards from being ruined with small hands and drinks. This game is never predictable, you can think you're about to win and then someone flips a deck and you end up with a handful of cards. Fun to play and the waterproof feature is added. If you want a easy to transport game that is for all ages this is the best one."" —LLPRESCHOOL Get it from Amazon for $14.24.  Promising review: ""This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you, thank you, thank you!"" —Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in women's sizes M–XXL and in several color combos).  Promising review: ""I have always had serious dark circles and bags under my eyes, and this has really changed this for me.

Best advice ever, used this when we were at Disney this past year.

It really is a wonderful device and definitely worth the money!"" —Texas  Get it from Amazon for $34.99 (also available with two specialty mounts).  Promising review: ""I never thought about getting something like this until someone on TikTok was talking about how this changed her life. Literallyyyyy it’s so easy to use, it doesn’t take me an hour to shave anymore, so I save so much time. I hated shaving so much because it took so long and was to tedious but now it’s so easy????? Please buy this thing, it is probably the best thing I’ve purchased on Amazon ever.

Individually packaged so you can keep one in the car, one in the gym bag, one in the desk, etc. Great to have at work if you have an afterwork event and don't have time to run home and freshen up beforehand. I have turned several of my friends and co-workers on to these."" —Randy C  Get a 40-pack from Amazon for $29.99. Psst — it's  also gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free!  Promising review: ""I love this stuff!!! In Florida, where the sun can take the moisture out of you between the heat and the humidity, you can tend to get a little dehydrated, no matter how much water you drink. I put one of these packets ion my large water bottle and drink. I start to feel better soon after I drink one. I don't do more than one a day, unless I am working extra hard outside in the summer heat. It reminds me of lemon/lime sports drinks without that awful sugary aftertaste."" —N. Abdallah Get a pack of 16 from Amazon for $22.28.   Each pack comes with bandages to fit your heel, toe, and foot. People who wear heels also recommend these!  As a blister-prone human, I swear by these. A few years ago, before I invested in these running socks that prevent blisters, I got a blister on my big toe so unspeakably large and painful that I am cringing even TYPING about it, and no amount of rest from running seemed to heal it; it just kept coming back. I finally used one of these bandages, and the pain was virtually gone from the moment I put it on. It was also so airtight that nothing got inside, and it didn't loosen in the shower. You're supposed to take it off when it loses adhesive so it can come off gently without disturbing the blister if it hasn't fully healed yet. After using two of these in a row over the course of a week and a half, my blister was finally healed up enough that it stopped coming back.  Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in four types of packs).  Note: Sharkbanz reduce the risk of a shark encounter, but do not eliminate the risk altogether. That said, the effectiveness of this band was tested by the Western Australian Government and verified by an independent third-party university — you can read more about the research conducted in the effectiveness of the Sharkbanz for reference.  Sharkbanz is a small business that specializes in shark-deterrent products. Promising review: ""This product is a strong magnet you wear on your ankle. (Watch out where you store it!) It is comfortable and easy to put on. I'm not sure if it really works; however, I never saw any sharks while swimming/snorkeling in Hawaii where there are tons of aggressive tiger sharks. In fact, the Sharkbanz was mandatory equipment to swim in a local group of shoreline swimmers. It comes in several colors to match your style. I strongly recommend this product — better safe than bitten!"" —Jennifer Keene Get it from Amazon for $128 (available in four styles).  Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity."

And reviewers mention that if you add a lick of paint after using this, your walls will look as good as new. Promising review: ""I slipped in the shower the other day and grabbed my towel bar outside of it so as not to die. Doing so, I ripped the bar off the wall, including the screws and anchors, so I had four small but kind of nasty holes in my wall. I've never done any sort of drywall repair/spackling etc. and I figured this would do the job. I applied the spackle, smoothed it with the flat end of the tube, and allowed it to dry. I was able to sand it smooth and then paint over the spackle. It looks fine now. I give it 5 stars for convenience."" —John C Get it from Amazon for $13.38. Promising review: ""For a fraction of the cost and the amazing results, I would recommend this. It was a quick fix to our ugly, really ugly laminate (boring) bathroom countertop. I would recommend buying double (whatever you think you might need) for coverage. Our at least 40-year-old, handmade, bathroom counter was approximately 3' by 6'. So we purchased five cans. I wanted one extra because I taped around the faucet too loosely for touch-ups. We used all five cans. If you live in a high humidity area, like us, give it plenty of time to cure. It took three days for second coats, then I added a third coat, so add on two more days and a fourth to give it that extra oomph. We are selling our home, so plan carefully, depending on your climate, it might take longer than you think."" —Ama Zon Customer Get it from Amazon for $23.99 (available in six colors). It even has a minty scent, so you don't have to worry about that harsh chemical smell most cleaning products usually emit. Promising review: ""I have tried for weeks to get rid of some very tough hard-water stains on my glass shower panel. They had been there for three years while my apartment was rented and never cleaned. I have tried just about everything from toothpaste to vinegar to different types of chemical products. Then I found this product...PURE MAGIC!!! The nontoxicity of the product is definitely a plus, it doesn't smell bad and doesn't sting your lungs like some hard chemicals do. Its biodegradability is a plus! I feel better knowing I'm not dumping some more toxic chemicals down the drain. Most importantly, it works!!! After 10 minutes of work it has removed 90% of the hard-water stains that simply would not come off in the past!!"" —O.R Get it from Amazon for $17.77. Promising review: ""Rather than ditching furniture into a landfill, which is bad for the environment and one's pocketbook, this product allows you to give new life to existing furniture.

This is a fantastic product. You will love it!"" —LexiNYC Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in 23 colors). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes says: ""I've used this before on my own kitchen tile, which had gross dark grout that stuck out like a sore thumb every time I walked in there. It takes a bit of time and patience since you have to go slow, but the instructions are very straightforward, and if you accidentally get some outside of the lines, you can just wipe it off. The end results are well worth it — the entire area looks newer and cleaner."" Promising review: ""I just bought my first house, and because of COVID I have not had the funds I wanted to fix it up. This was cheap, and the backsplash in my new kitchen was an eyesore. I wasn't expecting much because of the price, and I am absolutely stunned. My kitchen looks so much better! It was easy to use, no odor, and quick! I did two coats because the color was dark brown. Some places I did more, but I didn't mind doing it because it was actually really satisfying.

I can tell you that half of my cleaning products are now going to be thrown out because all I need is The Pink Stuff.

The kit comes with one Baseboard Buddy and three reusable pads which can be used wet or dry.  Promising review: ""Buy it NOW. Honestly, I had huge reservations for this thing. Yet another miracle cleaning tool that will break or bend or something. I was so wrong. It was easy to put together and I sprayed it with Mean Green and went to the baseboards.

I can't wait to do the rest of the house!"" —artgirl Get it from Amazon for $24.99.  Promising review: ""Changed the oil on my girlfriend's car and some oil spilled on my NEW driveway...which I didn't notice 'til four days later. Four spots all about the size of a dollar bill baking in the Arizona sun for four days. Found this searching on Amazon and I thought, whatever. That's one less vodka soda tonight for dinner. Put the stuff on (sits on the stain like pancake batter — don't be afraid to pour liberally) and let it sit from 6 p.m. 'til about 9 a.m. the next day. It dried and the instructions said to just sweep the stuff up (right, like I am not going to need a scraper and wire scrub pad for an hour. HA). Well it broke apart with the broom and the stains were gone, just swept up the powder pieces — took about a minute. I WAS SHOCKED! Something that actually works on oil and it's easy. Absolutely NO sign of anything that was there. My driveway is smooth concrete so I can't vouch for what would happen with a rougher surface but whoever makes this stuff is a genius. If they tried to take on World Peace, Earth would be a better place."" —AmazonBob Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). You can also use this on clothes and other surfaces like concrete and hardwood. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully for non-carpet use. Promising review: ""I have six elderly cats, and a few of them oftentimes leave smelly pee puddles to register their disdain at whatever cats get 'peed off' about. It's not a litter box problem and, although I've caught one or two of them doing it, I can't blame them all. This product works great on fresh messes as well as dried ones. After blotting up fresh pee, I saturate the area with Rocco & Roxie's odor remover and let dry. For dried stinky stuff, I just saturate the area and let it dry. It has a pleasant odor and completely eliminates the ammonia odor. Believe me, I've tried all kinds of products, and this one works the best. I buy gallons now just to have on hand. It's better than smelling that awful pee!"" —mona mia Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in two sizes). The kit comes with two cans of cabinet paint, a roller arm, two roller covers, and an angled paint brush. Promising review: ""Amazing! Amazing! Amazing. Did take more than one coat though. My cabinets were bare wood, and I still needed a couple of coats. (Five to be exact, but that was just me being extra.) My kitchen is medium-sized, not too big, and it only took up one can. But I still went over a couple more times just to get a nice coating. I also let it sit for some days and saw the wood was sucking up the paint in some areas, so I went over it again. The project ideally does take one day like the promotion video says, but one day as in 24 hours. This took my kitchen from looking like a cheap rental apartment kitchen to a high-quality kitchen with just this paint and new knobs. The paint is perfect for cabinets — it's not too thick, so you still see the wood grains. It comes with EVERYTHING you need. I didn't have to buy a thing. The project is super easy, paint dries fast, and I did it at first by removing the cabinets, but it wasn't necessary at all. Just make sure you don't leave any dripping because it would make your cabinets look cheap. I would recommend EVERYONE to purchase this and give your cabinets a chance before making a big investment in new cabinets. Wood is wood, and it can be refinished."" —Brandon Moronta Get it from Amazon for $109.67 (available in 11 colors).

Shortly after moving in, my partner and I went to store something on the top of the kitchen cabinets, only to find them caked in a thick layer of grime. 🤢 After going at it with regular multipurpose cleaner (with little success), we broke out the scour paste as a last-ditch effort, and OH BOY did this miracle product deliver (pics above). If it can handle that grossness, it's going to have no problem with day-to-day messes like soap scum and burnt-on food. Plus, it smells delightful and comes in minimal, low-waste packaging!"" Get it from Humble Suds on Etsy for $11.96+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""We renovated to a more modern-industrial look and wanted to keep our mid-century modern slate-blue-gray sofa. Unfortunately, it has no legs. So to bring it into a more contemporary style, we added these legs. We are thrilled with how it turned out! Really made the couch look new again and the subtle styling blends in well with our new surroundings. The price was amazing. I would get these again in any size."" —Lorine Thiele Get a set of four from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in four sizes, three colors, and packs of eight). Promising review: ""This is truly the perfect power washer. First, it is very easy to put together, with clear step-by-step instructions. Second, it has a very small footprint, so it fits nicely anywhere in the garage without protruding out. Third, it is very powerful. We used it to power wash all stone and concrete surfaces around our house and pool and then even the sidewalk in front of the house. Many of the stone/concrete surfaces that we cleaned had dark stains and/or green moss, which had developed for many years (some up to 20 years). This Sun Joe was able to clean everything. Fourth, it is very reliable. We have now used it for three weekends in a row. And each time, we used it continuously, nonstop for several hours at a time."" —EdS Get it from Amazon for $199. The four-piece set comes with a base cover and three individual cushion covers. AND these covers are also available in a smaller version for armchairs! Promising review: ""I have never been so excited about a slip cover. Total transformation of our couch and loveseat. I was worried about it not working on our leather couch, but it stays on really well due to the straps and the separate cushion covers. LOVE."" —Brian/Liz Get it from Amazon for $35.49+ (available in five sizes and 13 colors). And by kit, I mean a brush and 16-ounce bottle of nontoxic fireplace cleaning formula. Promising Review: ""Unbelievable! My daughter just moved into her first home. She thought she would have to paint her brick fireplace because of the heavy soot stains that had been there for years. We applied the product twice and put in a whole lot of elbow grease, but what a difference!! It’s a messy process, but well worth the time and energy."" —MM Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in two sizes and other packs). My former colleague Kayla Suazo uses this and raves: ""This mildew remover can destroy any stain in its path. When I moved into my apartment, it looked like there hadn't been repairs since the '60s, and that included re-caulking the bathtub. I tried bleach and every type of shower cleaner at the store, but nothing removed the mold and mildew stains that had been there for like, 40 years. UNTIL I BOUGHT THIS INCREDIBLE MAGIC GEL. I am one happy customer."" Promising review: ""I have scrubbed this caulk hundreds of times trying to clean it; it always stayed so gross. I decided to try this stuff and I am so glad I did!!! 10/10. I highly recommend you get this if you have any gross caulk. Follow the directions and it works like a charm. Some spots were a little wet, so I am going to redo a couple of spots, but I couldn't be happier!"" —Reviewer Get it from Amazon for $14.99. And! You can customize this to fit your exact needs by choosing the size and color theme. Covogoods was founded by Camille, who wanted to decorate a room with pieces that would add texture and interest to the space, provide additional storage and organization, *and* hide ugly things like electronics and cords. The Utah-based home decor small biz now offers decorative books by color, hidden storage book boxes, blank decorative books, secret door books, cut book spines, faux book panels, electronics hiders, and fairy book houses — just to name a few! Promising review: ""I’m pretty sure I’ve never loved a purchase from Amazon as much as I love this one. This product is EXTREMELY well-made and very unique. Plus, it does the job of hiding the ugly routers and cords. And the customer service was great and responsive. I was a little hesitant to spend the money on this but after years of living with the husband’s pile of technology, the money was well spent!"" —AmazonEmme Get it from Covogoods on Amazon Handmade for $29+ (available in 14 sizes and 15 colors or a custom color). Promising review: ""My new fridge is deep, with hardly any shelf space on the door due to the in-door icemaker. Since the condiments and small jars that I was previously able to store in the door had to be relegated to the regular shelves, my fridge was a mess and I could never find anything. These storage bins are a dream. I was able to categorize them, so all jellies are together, condiments are together, etc. If we're having burgers, I just pull out the condiment bin, which makes life so much easier!"" —Carolyn72 Get a set of eight bins from Amazon for $20.49 (available in four sizes and in various pack sizes).  Leather Honey is a family-owned small business based in the USA specializing in making leather care products. Promising review: “This product is the perfect consistency to spread easily. It cleans leather deeply without harming it. Dries fast so that there's no residue on your leather. I used it on a chair and a coat. It doesn't seem to leave any lasting noticeable smell either. Just nice clean leather. The chair was a favorite for my dog, which is the reason I bought this in the first place. She's not supposed to be on the chair! So yes, it's desperately needed cleaning. The honey leather works great. The leather coat had been in a closet for two years in Florida where humidity can get to it. Once again, great job. Easy-to-use and the coat looks like new! Another good thing is that it seems to condition the leather as well. It felt much more supple after the first simple cleaning. I just put the honey leather on a washcloth, kept moving the the washcloth to a new clean area and adding more product. And both the chair and the coat felt like new leather again. And looked fantastic."" —N3rd Girl Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in three sizes). The reviews in this post have been edited for length and clarity."
