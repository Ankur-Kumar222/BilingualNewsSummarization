The judge who oversaw former President Donald Trump’s hush money criminal trial in New York made the parties aware Friday of a post to the court system’s Facebook page. In the post, a user said, ""My cousin is a juror and says Trump is getting convicted Thank you folks for all your hard work!!!!” Judge Juan Merchan said the comment, now labeled as one week old, responded to a routine court system notice, posted on May 29, 2024, regarding oral arguments in the Fourth Department of the Appellate Division unrelated to this proceeding. The notification by the judge did not ask the parties to do anything but seemed intended to merely flag them.  In a separate letter, Judge Merchan granted defense attorney Todd Blanche permission to attend Trump’s pre-sentence investigation interview. Trump's pre-sentence interview with a probation officer will take place Monday afternoon at Mar-a-Lago, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. A jury found Trump guilty last week on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. It marks the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been convicted on criminal charges. Trump is expected to file an appeal after he is sentenced in July. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
1,TIM REYNOLDS AP basketball writer,NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says finalizing the new media rights deals is 'complex' process,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nba-commissioner-adam-silver-finalizing-new-media-rights-110915384,"Getting the NBA’s next round of media rights deals completed is an extremely complex proposition, Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday, especially because nobody can say with any certainty what the viewing landscape will look like in the future",2024-06-07T00:14:32Z,"Getting the NBA’s next round of media rights deals completed is an extremely complex proposition, Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday, especially because nobody can say with any certainty what the viewing landscape will look like in the future BOSTON -- Getting the NBA's next round of media rights deals completed is an extremely complex proposition, Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday, especially because nobody can say with any certainty what the viewing landscape will look like in the future. Silver, speaking in his annual pre-NBA Finals news conference, did not offer any hints on when the next series of deals will be completed, other than saying “in the relative near term.” The current deals with ABC-ESPN and Turner Sports expire after next season and the NBA has been talking with NBC, ESPN and Amazon, among other networks and platforms, about what comes next. “It’s complicated for several reasons,"" Silver said. ""One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming and the interest of streaming companies and in the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms. It’s complicated because with multiple partners, all seeking similar assets in many cases, you're just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners.” The expectations, from networks and others involved in the process, is that the new agreements will be for 11 years and could exceed $70 billion in total value. Those would smash the existing norms for both value and deal length; the current one is nine years, $24 billion. “We tend to do long-term deals,"" Silver said. ""We think that’s good for the stability of the league. But it means to a certain extent you’re trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible. Part of it is a bet on the partners that we'll ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and to become global, which is very important to the league as well.” What remains most unclear is how, or if, Turner will remain involved with the NBA when the new deals get struck. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav sounded an ominous note in late 2022, saying that Turner and WBD “don’t have to have the NBA” once their current deal expires. If WBD is not part of the next deals, one of the most recognizable changes for fans could be the demise of the highly popular “Inside the NBA” program featuring former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny Smith. “That show, in particular, is special.” Silver said. When the deals get done — whether it's in the coming days, weeks or even months — it would clear the way for the next major item on the NBA’s to-do list, that being expansion. Silver has been very clear on the order of his top agenda items in recent seasons, those being preserving labor peace (which was achieved with the new Collective Bargaining Agreement) and getting a new media deal (talks ongoing). Then the league, at some point, will turn its attention toward adding new franchises. “By turning to expansion, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to announce that now we’re ready to add teams,"" Silver said. ""It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. ... I actually am looking forward to that. I think the league, it’s not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there’s an enormous amount of interest out there” In other topics covered by Silver: Silver didn't opine on the hard foul that Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark took from Chicago Sky guard Chennedy Carter last weekend, a play that has been scrutinized in countless ways from countless parties. “As a fan, obviously, it’s nothing new in basketball that there’s sort of welcome-to-the-league moments, especially for heralded rookies,” Silver said. “But of course, I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league. I would say, seems like she can take care of herself. She’s a tough player.” Silver calls Clark “an incredible talent” and says all the attention she helps brings is good for the game — while noting that the growth of the fan base for the women's game didn't start just now, either. He also said it can't be ignored that there are “larger societal issues at work ... some having to do with race"" when discussing the attention Clark generates and how that is received. ""Sports, historically, has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues,"" Silver said. “I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage about these issues.” Silver said he believed the $750,000 fine the NBA issued to the Dallas Mavericks was appropriate last season, after a brief investigation showed the team engaged in “conduct detrimental to the league” by sitting out most of its key players against the Chicago Bulls on April 7, 2023. The Mavs still had a chance to reach the playoffs, but the NBA said the it believed the team made its roster decisions that night “in order to improve the chances of keeping its first-round pick in the 2023 NBA Draft.” That pick became Dereck Lively II, who has played a significant role for the Mavericks in their run to the NBA Finals. “In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time,” Silver said. “I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they’re now seeing in the playoffs and here they are at the finals, I don’t attribute it to one draft pick — as important as that draft pick has been to their team.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
2,Matt Seyler,Permission to win: Ukraine needs more from Biden than weapons to defeat Russia,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/permission-win-ukraine-biden-weapons-defeat-russia-experts/story?id=110924679,"Ukraine needs more from Biden than weapons to defeat Russia, according to experts.",2024-06-08T09:42:24Z,"Fear of escalation with Putin plagues U.S. leadership, experts told ABC News. Soon after President Joe Biden announced a new $225 million package of desperately-needed weapons and ammunition for Ukraine during an in-person meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris Friday, he told Biden that to thwart the Russian invasion, Ukraine must be allowed to use the weapons to strike at its source: Inside Russia itself. Last week, Biden gave limited permission for Ukrainian forces to fire back at Russians attacking Kharkiv from just across the border with United States' weapons, but the administration has been emphatic that it still opposes strikes on key military targets elsewhere on Russian territory. ""It should not be construed as a shift away from our broader policy that we don’t encourage or enable U.S. weapons to be used against targets inside Russia,"" a U.S. official said. Zelenskyy has been vocal about the importance of using long-range Western weapons, like the U.S.-provided Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), against military targets in Russia. ""There is no moral, legal, or military reason for restricting them from using ATACMS, or any other weapon that we give them across the border,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, who led all U.S. Army forces in Europe. As opposed to ethics, law or sound military strategy, the restrictive American policy for Ukraine is based on fear, according to Hodges and other experts on the region. ""I believe it is actually just fear of escalation,"" George Barros, leader of the Institute for the Study of War's Russia team, told ABC News on Friday. Since launching his invasion in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin has deliberately cultivated such fear within the U.S. and NATO. Putin rattled the saber most recently on Friday while speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, where he threatened to begin arming enemies of the West with precision weapons. “If they supply these weapons to the combat zone and call for the use of these weapons on our territory, why then don’t we have the right to do the same, to respond in a mirror way?"" Putin said. Biden and his cabinet members at the Pentagon and State Department have repeatedly vowed to assist Ukraine for ""as long as it takes."" However, Hodges and Barros believe the administration has been unduly cowed by the Kremlin into not doing ""what it takes."" Hodges sees the Biden administration's hesitant, incremental approach to supporting Ukraine -- seen in the pattern of refusing to send advanced equipment like Patriot air-defense systems, Abrams tanks and F-16 fighters before eventually relenting -- as a symptom of its failure to conceive and express a clear strategic vision for its support of Ukraine.  ""It's all kind of wishy-washy, leaves all kinds of caveats,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to develop good strategy and good policy if you don't have a clearly defined end state."" Without a clearly defined objective, ""You end up with bad policy, just as we did for 20 years in Afghanistan,"" he said. With its current restrictions, the U.S. is ""giving Russia sanctuary from which they're murdering innocent Ukrainian people,"" Hodges said. Changing the policy to instead help deny Russian forces sanctuary on their home turf could have a major impact on how the war plays out, according to Barros. ""One of the most decisive things that the administration can do, but that it really, earnestly, has not done, is unambiguously remove all the sanctuary space and allow the Ukrainians to conduct strikes in the deep and operational rears with all the U.S.-provided weapons,"" Barros said. ""This is super, super important, because I actually do think that we are on the cusp of what could be a game changer for the Ukrainians and what they could do on the battlefield.""  Russia's dependence on centralized leadership orchestrating masses of poorly-trained troops might leave it especially vulnerable to long-range strikes on command centers and other targets behind the front lines. ""The way you defeat their only advantage, which is mass, is with precision,"" Hodges said. ""Precision out to 300 kilometers allows you to destroy headquarters, logistics, artillery, long-range fires – if you can destroy those, then you completely emasculate the Russian army."" A policy change from Biden could disrupt Putin's war machine even before Ukraine launched its first U.S. missile deep into Russia, according to Barros. Just the threat of use would force Russian commanders to make hard decisions on whether to move any of its limited air-defense systems away from the front lines to cover its rear areas, leaving one or both at least partially exposed. Those rear areas are ""currently configured to maximize economic efficiency,"" Barros said. But a new, credible threat of attack could immediately deprive Russia of such luxury. With restrictions removed, Ukraine could also use U.S.-provided precision weapons to possibly destroy air-defenses within Russia, making it more likely Ukraine could overcome the current air-superiority stalemate and use its coming F-16s to good effect. Despite the limits being imposed, military aid approved by the Biden administration has been significant, and it is doubtful Ukraine would have retained so much of its territory without it. With the aid package announced on Friday, which included more artillery pieces and ammunition, as well as rockets for its High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), the U.S. has now committed more than $51 billion to Ukraine since Russia initiated the war. ""It's better than not having it, for sure,"" Hodges said to ABC News, ""But none of this is decisive.""  Helping Ukraine, and helping it achieve victory are not the same. ""We haven't even tried to actually help Ukraine win yet,"" Hodges said. While the outcome will be undoubtedly consequential for Ukrainians, assisting them toward victory is no matter of altruism for Americans, according to Hodges and Barros. ""If you want to keep NATO out of a fight with Russia, then we need to help Ukraine defeat Russia,"" Hodges said. Barros echoed that sentiment, going on to say he believes Putin would love to go down as the man who proved NATO to be a paper tiger in a future attack on Europe. ""There's actually a real opportunity here for the Russians to achieve that in a conventional small-scale war in the future, if we're not careful,"" he said. But the way the U.S. handles the current conflagration in Europe could also have implications for a potentially higher-stakes war looming in the Pacific, argued Hodges. ""I think the Chinese are watching closely to see if we have the political will, industrial capacity and military capability to help Ukraine defeat Russia, where it is a much, much simpler problem than it will be out in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Hodges said. ""So this is about deterring China, also."" Barros said that if the U.S. undermines its stated principle of supporting Ukraine due to nuclear threats from Russia, it would give the ""greenest light you can give"" to any other malign nation seeking leverage over America. ""All you have to simply do is just get nukes, and you'll get a veto on our decision making,"" he said. He added, ""If we're not willing to take that risk with Russia, why would it be any different with China?"" And that risk is low, according to both Barros and Hodges. ""Putin, he's evil, but he's not crazy,"" said Hodges, who argued that Russia has more to gain by threatening to use nuclear weapons than actually detonating them, which would likely bring a swift, destructive response. Barros pointed out the U.S. has already blown past several Kremlin warnings that proved toothless. ""Even though we cannot 100% eliminate the risk, I think you can be really intellectual robust about this and say that the risk is extremely low, that we actually can indeed push back against the Russians, that we have, over the course the last two years collected sufficient evidence, and we know enough about Putin's reaction to our efforts to push back on him, that we actually can do this,"" he said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Prince William on Friday celebrated the marriage of one of his and Prince Harry's closest friends. William served as an usher at the wedding of Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, and Olivia Henson. The couple wed at Chester Cathedral in Chester, England, about four hours outside of London. William was seen mingling with guests at the wedding, which he attended solo, without his wife Kate, the Princess of Wales, who has stayed out of the public eye since announcing in March that she had been diagnosed with cancer. William's younger brother Harry, who now lives in California with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their two children, also did not attend the wedding.  Both William and Harry chose Grosvenor, their lifelong friend, to be the godfather to each of their respective eldest children, Princes George and Archie. Grosvenor is also the godson of King Charles III, William and Harry's father. Neither Charles nor his wife Queen Camilla attended the wedding on Friday. Charles, like his daughter-in-law Kate, was also diagnosed with cancer this year.  The types of cancer with which Charles and Kate were diagnosed have not been disclosed. As he did Friday at Grosvenor's wedding, William has been attending events solo in recent months, in the wake of both his wife's and father's diagnoses. On Thursday, William stood in for Charles alongside heads of state at a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
4,Matt Rivers,ABC News exclusive: Inside a cartel's human-smuggling operation,https://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-exclusive-inside-cartels-human-smuggling-operation/story?id=110919861,ABC News exclusive: Matt Rivers reports on a cartel's human-smuggling operation in Mexico.,2024-06-10T13:16:33Z,"A first-hand account of a night in the Mexican desert. We are unlikely travelers on this dirt road, inching our way toward a tiny speck of a town in the middle of the northern Mexican desert. The trail of dust from our tires kicks up in the midnight air, silhouetted by the full moon overhead, letting our contact know we’re arriving as we approach a collection of houses. It’s a tense moment because although we’ve been invited to be here, this is cartel land. The threats are just about everywhere when there is this much money being made. A small man in a black zip-up hoodie greets us and tells us to stay put for a bit, he needs to make sure it’s OK we can keep going. He talks quickly into a walkie-talkie, the preferred way to communicate in the coded, you-never-know-who’s-listening language of the smugglers. Forty-five minutes later we’re told to move ahead. The reasons for our trip to this place, around 100 of them, are gathered outside a cluster of houses a short ride away. “They’re from everywhere,” the man in the hoodie tells us of the large group of people gathered, waiting expectantly. “It’s like the United Nations.” Tonight, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Senegal and more are all represented. Other nights, it’s Russia, Turkey, China. The list goes on. They are all from different places but they are all migrants, sharing a singular purpose: to get to the U.S. And it’s the men guarding them, the human smugglers with masks and guns, who will help them get there. “Every week we’re getting 200-300 people,” one smuggler told ABC News. “But it’s happening all over the border every day, every night.” The United States southwest border is in the midst of an unrelenting wave of migration. Millions of people have arrived since 2021, numbers higher than ever before. The reasons behind those trips are varied and nuanced. Many are fleeing poverty or violence, political or religious persecution, wars, climate change. It’s all here. But what is often lost in telling that complicated story, is the how – how are millions of people are arriving so quickly, so efficiently? That answer is simpler. It's organized crime. “This amount of people arriving to the border would not be possible without this level of involvement by transnational organized crime,” said Gerardo Rodríguez Sánchez Lara, an international security expert who has studied organized crime for decades. Human smuggling is not new, but it has been transformed in the last few years into an industrial operation. Cartels have quickly figured out that facilitating the flow of migrants to the U.S. border can be remarkably lucrative. Different organized crime groups control sections of the border, called plazas, with each controlling what happens inside its own territory. In order to get to the border these days, migrants almost always have to pay. “Everything has an owner and you need to respect that,” one smuggler told ABC News. “[The migrants] can’t cross by themselves. The only thing they would get is a certain death. They could give it a try but here, you have to pay.” Ruthlessly efficient and with a seemingly never-ending demand from people around the world trying to make it to the U.S., Rodríguez Sánchez Lara believes “human [smugglers] will be richer than drug traffickers within the next five years.” Manufacturing, transporting and selling drugs is remunerative, but difficult. Substantial investment must be made to produce the product. Sending it north and selling it in the U.S. comes with significant risk that the product, and therefore that initial investment, could be lost. No money is recouped by the cartels when authorities seize drugs. With human smuggling, there is considerably less initial investment and risk. Migrants pay for their trips to the border up front. The smugglers bring them only as far as the wall, meaning they have to worry much less about U.S. authorities. And should the groups be intercepted by Mexican law enforcement and the migrants subsequently deported, the smugglers do not hand out refunds. Compared to drug trafficking, human smuggling carries lower risk while the reward can be just as high, says Rodríguez Sanchez Lara. The money being made is astronomical. ABC News saw a microcosm of that play out first-hand, when we were granted extraordinary access inside a human smuggling operation run by one of Mexico’s largest cartels. This group is responsible for so-called “long haul” migrants – people that are often paying between $10,000 on the low end to $100,000 on the high end for a trip to the U.S. Just after midnight, they huddled in a group around a smuggler with a cell phone, who was acting as a ticket checker of sorts. To make the final push toward the border, all of the migrants had to pay a final fee to the cartel. While fees can vary, most paid the smugglers about $5,000 to get from Mexico City to the border, a payment in addition to whatever they had to spend to arrive at the capital city. Once that payment was made, a photograph of the migrant was taken and sent to the smuggler on the ground, in what amounted to a digital receipt. The smuggler scrolled through his list of photographs, matching pictures to the faces of the people standing in front of him. Once he matched a migrant’s face with a photo, they were allowed to move forward. Those who hadn't yet paid were forced to wait. To get an idea of how much money is being made every day in the human smuggling industry along the border, some simple math is required. ABC News saw about 100 migrants that night in the desert. If each had paid only $10,000, the lowest estimated amount, that totals $1 million. That’s $1 million dollars just from this one small group at this one part of the border. These kinds of transactions are happening up and down the length of the border every single day. That is why the U.S. government estimates that the human smuggling industry is earning billions of dollars annually. The money doesn't all go into cartel pockets but large amounts do, especially in Mexico. They have every incentive to continue pushing people north as quickly as possible, which often leads to migrants being seen not as people, but as commodities. ABC News watched as dozens of migrants were packed into four stripped-down SUVs. Smugglers seated people with their knees to their chests, legs spread wide enough so that the next migrant could sit between their feet. It is inhumane. It is also the most efficient way to cram as many people as possible into an SUV. “I’m only asking God to make sure everything turns out well because we want to go [to the U.S.] to work and do things right,” one migrant woman holding a child told ABC News. “It has to be worth it.” One migrant from Senegal told ABC News he spent his entire life's savings and went into debt to make the trip. “It’s worth leaving Senegal to go to the United States because I will have a better life there,” he said. ABC News also saw two dozen men forced into a horse trailer, standing packed together so tightly that there was no room to turn around, let alone sit. Each group of migrants was then driven three hours through the winding, bumpy desert until they reached a spot on the border wall through which they could walk. The trip usually takes two hours but there was a heavy law enforcement presence in the area that night so they had to take a longer route. When they arrived, smugglers recorded each person crossing over and sent the videos to their bosses. It’s proof of performance, showing they're doing their jobs. “We’re not taking advantage of them, we’re doing what they ask us to do,” one smuggler told ABC News. “There are others out there who do bad things to the migrants but we’re not them.” ABC News' Anne Laurent contributed to this story. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
5,Ivan Pereira,What's next for Hunter Biden following conviction on federal gun charges,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hunter-biden-conviction-federal-gun-charges/story?id=111023241,"Following Hunter Biden's conviction on federal gun charges, the first son faces major time in prison.",2024-06-11T16:06:52Z,"President Joe Biden said he will not pardon his son. Hunter Biden has become the first child of a president to be convicted of a federal crime and those charges are likely to stick. President Joe Biden's son has been convicted on two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm. The charges carry serious penalties. The two counts of making false statements carry prison sentences of up to 10 years and five years, respectively, while the possession charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years.  After Judge Maryellen Noreika excused jurors following the verdict Tuesday, she said she would get back in touch with the parties to schedule a sentencing date in the next 120 days. Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement Tuesday that they ""will continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.""  President Joe Biden told ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir that he would not pardon his son if convicted. He also told Muir that he would accept the verdict. President Biden reiterated his stance in a statement released later Tuesday. ""I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that,"" he said. For a first offender, who didn't use the gun it would be highly unlikely for Hunter Biden to see prison time, according to ABC News' chief legal analyst Dan Abrams. ""Here we have an isolated crime with nothing else, it would be very surprising for Hunter Biden to serve time,"" Abrams said on ABC News Live. Hunter Biden faces more federal charges in his tax case which goes to trial in September.  Special Counsel David Weiss accused Hunter Biden in a December 2023 indictment of failing to pay taxes on income he earned from overseas business ventures. Hunter Biden and prosecutors also tried to arrange a plea deal along with the gun charges, but those fell through. The back taxes and penalties were subsequently paid in full by a third party, identified by ABC News as Hunter Biden's attorney and confidant Kevin Morris. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which include six misdemeanor charges and three felonies. The tax charges carry a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison if convicted.

6,Mary Kekatos,Boeing's Starliner has 5 'small' helium leaks as astronauts' ISS mission is extended,https://abcnews.go.com/US/boeings-starliner-5-small-helium-leaks-astronauts-iss/story?id=111012781,"Boeing said its Starliner spacecraft is experiencing five ""small"" helium leaks as the crew's mission aboard the ISS was extended to June 18.",2024-06-11T18:44:12Z,"The astronauts are now scheduled to return to Earth on June 18. Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is experiencing five ""small"" helium leaks as its first astronaut-crewed flight test continues, the aerospace company and NASA said in an update on Monday. While a major milestone was reached when Starliner successfully docked and delivered two NASA astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) on June 6, the leaks mark the latest of several hurdles faced during this mission, including previous helium leaks and a thruster issue. Helium is used to pressurize the spacecraft's reaction control system (RCS) maneuvering thrusters, allowing them to fire, according to Boeing.  The leaks are similar to those discovered during Starliner's May 25 launch attempt. That launch was scrubbed after a small helium leak was discovered in the service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating the spacecraft. Although it's unclear how much helium is leaking, Boeing said that engineers have evaluated the helium supply and the leak rates, and have concluded that Starliner has enough helium for its return mission. The astronauts only need seven hours of ""free-flight time"" to perform the end-of-mission maneuvers and Starliner currently has enough helium for 70 hours of free-flight time, Boeing said. ""While Starliner is docked, all the manifolds are closed per normal mission operations preventing helium loss from the tanks,"" read the update from the aerospace company. Engineers are also examining a valve that is not properly closed on the RCS. All other valves cycled normally during a check on Sunday, according to the update. Astronauts Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore and Sunita ""Suni"" Williams are continuing to test Starliner as part of the data collection required for potential NASA certification to send regularly crewed missions to the ISS. NASA has primarily been using SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport crew and cargo to the ISS. Tests include making sure the spacecraft can power up again when it's put in minimal power mode during missions aboard the ISS, as well as ensuring Starliner can support a crew with its own air, evaluating seats onboard, and checking the service module's batteries, according to Boeing.  Wilmore and Williams were scheduled to return to Earth on Friday, June 14. However, the mission has been extended until June 18, pending weather and Starliner's readiness. ""@NASA and @BoeingSpace teams set a return date of no earlier than Tuesday, June 18, for the agency's Boeing Crew Flight Test,"" ISS officials wrote Sunday in a post on the social platform X. ""The additional time in orbit will allow the crew to perform a spacewalk on Thursday, June 13, while engineers complete #Starliner systems checkouts."" The spacewalk will be performed by two different astronauts, but the extra days spent onboard will also allow preparations to be made for future spacewalks, NASA said on Monday. Because Starliner's launch and ISS docking have been completed, the final phase of the current mission will be Starliner undocking from the ISS and then adjusting its orbit to move away from the space station before re-entering Earth's atmosphere and landing in the southwestern U.S. ABC News' Gina Sunseri contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
7,Tommy Barone,Trump-endorsed Nancy Mace fighting to keep her South Carolina congressional seat,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorsed-nancy-mace-fighting-south-carolina-congressional/story?id=111019980,Voters in the Republican primary for South Carolina's 1st congressional district will vote Tuesday and decide the political future of Republican Rep. Nancy Mace.,2024-06-11T18:51:35Z,"Mace is one step closer to keeping her Congressional seat. For the second time in as many years, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace has defeated a fierce GOP primary challenge in South Carolina’s 1st congressional district. With 27% of the vote reporting as of 8:40 p.m ET., the Associated Press projects Mace will win South Carolina’s 1st district with an outright majority of more than 57%. During a speech in the Charleston area, Mace emphatically thanked Trump for his support in this race while vaguely referring to her controversial reputation.  “President Trump, South Carolina will have your back in November. Thank you all for standing by me and sticking with me, and many of you for sticking up for me,” Mace said during her celebration speech. The result is a stunning victory for the sophomore representative, whose lead opponent, former state director of labor, licensing and regulation Catherine Templeton, outraised her in 2024 and received an endorsement and financial support from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy-linked group Majority Committee PAC donated $10,000 to Templeton’s run, per FEC filings. Mace’s second campaign for reelection put on display the shifting allegiances of the fractious modern GOP. Once a vocal critic of Trump, Mace had former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s endorsement in 2022 and received financial contributions from PACs linked to top GOP leaders as she faced a primary opponent endorsed by the former president.  Since then, the roles have reversed: Trump enthusiastically backed Mace after she endorsed him in the state’s presidential primary over Haley, and McCarthy has sought vengeance for Mace’s vote to oust him from the speakership. Trump and Mace’s detente would have been nearly unthinkable two years ago. One day after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Mace said Trump’s “entire legacy” was “wiped out” by the siege. Later, during the 2022 midterms, Trump called Mace “terrible” and a letdown. “Frankly, she is despised by almost everyone, and who needs that in Congress, or in the Republican Party?” Trump said in a statement on his social media while endorsing Mace's opponent. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
8,"Lucien Bruggeman, Olivia Rubin, Laura Romero, Will Steakin, Chris Boccia","What the key witnesses in Hunter Biden's trial, including Hallie Biden, testified",https://abcnews.go.com/US/key-witnesses-hunter-bidens-trial-including-hallie-biden/story?id=111017532,The president's son was convicted on three felony charges related to efforts to obtain a firearm.,2024-06-11T18:37:13Z,"A jury found Hunter Biden guilty on three counts in his felony gun case. A jury on Tuesday found Hunter Biden guilty on three felony charges related to his efforts to obtain a firearm in October 2018. The president's son had been charged with two counts related to false statements in purchasing the firearm and a third count of illegally obtaining a firearm while addicted to drugs. Over the past week, a jury of 12 Delawareans heard vivid and personal details about President Joe Biden's family. Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison, though legal experts believe he would not serve time as a first-time and nonviolent offender. President Joe Biden previously told ABC News he would not pardon his son. In a statement Tuesday, he vowed to respect the jury's decision. ""I am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from [wife Melissa Cohen Biden], my family, my friends, and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,"" Hunter Biden said in a statement after the verdict. His attorney Abbe Lowell said they ""will continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter."" Hunter Biden's trial saw 13 witnesses on the stand and at least 70 exhibits entered into evidence – including more than 290 text messages the government used to make its case against the president's son. The testimony heard by jury stretched over five days, from last Tuesday through Friday, and then this past Monday morning.  Thirteen different witnesses testified – 10 called by the government and three by the defense. Five of those government witnesses were law enforcement or expert witnesses. Surveillance video was also played in court. Last week, prosecutors summoned his ex-wife and two of his exes to the stand in an effort to chip away at the defense's argument that the president's son wasn't addicted to drugs when he filled out a form to purchase a firearm in 2018. Hallie Biden Hallie Biden, the widow of President Joe Biden's late son Beau Biden, testified as a key government witness, recounting in excruciating detail the ""terrible experience"" of Hunter Biden's drug addiction in the months leading up to her discovery of a firearm in his vehicle. Prosecutors used the testimony of Hallie Biden, who was Hunter Biden's romantic partner at the time, to attest to Hunter Biden's drug use in October 2018, when prosecutors say Hunter Biden lied on an ATF form when he said he wasn't using drugs at the time he purchased the firearm. In dramatic testimony, Hallie Biden said that on the morning of Oct. 23, 2018, she went to go ""clean out"" Hunter's car in hopes of helping him ""deal with stuff"" and possibly ""get sober if she wasn't""-- but she ultimately found both a gun, remnants of drugs, and drug paraphernalia.  ""What did you find, in addition to trash and clothes?"" prosecutor Leo Wise asked her. ""Remnants of crack cocaine and some paraphernalia,"" Hallie recounted. ""Oh and the gun, obviously."" ""I panicked, I wanted to get rid of them,"" she told the jury. Asked why she panicked, Hallie said "" didn't want him to hurt himself,"" referring to Hunter. She said she also worried about her kids finding the gun, saying she considered ""hiding"" it somewhere but was worried they would find it. Surveillance video During Hallie Biden's testimony, jurors were shown surveillance video from the grocery store that shows Hallie Biden throwing the gun into the trash. Ex-wife, another girlfriend Ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan, who met Hunter Biden as a private dancer at a New York gentlemen's club when she was 24 and he was 48, said she observed him smoking crack cocaine in late September 2018, just weeks before he walked into a Delaware gun shop and purchased a Colt Cobra revolver from Gordon Cleveland, another witness who testified on Wednesday. Hunter Biden's ex-wife Kathleen Buhle testified about Hunter Biden's alcohol and drug abuse during their 25-year marriage, describing how their relationship deteriorated as her husband's drug abuse increased. When Hunter Biden was on crack, Buhle testified, ""He was not himself."" ""He was angry, short-tempered, acting in ways he wouldn't when he was sober,"" she said. Buhle said she would find drug ""remnants in little bags"" and drug paraphernalia like ""a broken crack pipe"" -- often enough that she would search his car before allowing her daughters to use it. She said that despite his manner when he was on crack, he nonetheless managed to ""function"" normally as an addict -- possibly undermining the defense's claim that ""there is no such thing as a high-functioning crack addict."" Buhle admitted during cross-examination that she never personally saw Hunter Biden use drugs. Gun store clerk Cleveland, the employee at the gun store who sold Hunter Biden the firearm in question, also testified, saying he watched from ""about two feet"" away as Hunter Biden filled out the form that asked applicants whether they were active drug users. Cleveland testified that he watched as Hunter Biden answered several questions before he approached the drug-related question then marked the box with an ""X."" Former Delaware State Police officer  Former Delaware State Police lieutenant Millard Greer described tracking down the gun after Hallie Biden had thrown it in the trash outside the supermarket. Greer said he reviewed surveillance footage, interviewed witnesses, and ultimately retrieved the weapon from local resident Edward Banner, who was known to ""rummage through trash."" Greer said Banner had placed the firearm in a sock along with a leather pouch containing the gun. Banner, called as the government's last witness of the day, corroborated much of Greer's account, testifying he'd found the gun in a trash can outside the grocery store, stored it on a top shelf at home, and ultimately turned it over to Greer. Hunter's daughter Naomi Biden, the 30-year-old daughter of Hunter Biden, testified that she twice saw her father during the timeframe in 2018 when Hunter Biden's attorneys said he was not actively using drugs, and each time, she testified, he ""seemed great."" ""He seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died, and he just seemed really great,"" she said of an August 2018 visit to Los Angeles to see her father. The next time she saw him, in New York, just days after he had purchased the firearm, ""He seemed great, he seemed hopeful,"" she said. It was important testimony for the defense, which was attempting to convince jurors that, despite his on-again-off-again addiction in the months prior to and after his gun purchase, Hunter Biden was not actively using drugs in October 2018. But Naomi Biden's testimony later provided some favorable moments for the government's case, particularly when prosecutor Leo Wise read aloud from text messages that seemed to run contrary to her claim that Hunter Biden was doing ""great."" In mid-October 2018, both Naomi and her father were in New York, attempting to exchange cars. Naomi Biden had used her father's vehicle -- the one in which, days later, Hallie Biden would find the Colt Cobra firearm -- to move from Washington, D.C., to New York. In messages he sent in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 18, 2018, Hunter Biden suggested he and Naomi Biden's then-boyfriend meet to exchange cars at the Manhattan intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 57th Street -- the intersection where, coincidentally, Trump Tower sits. ""Do you know what your father was doing at 2 o'clock in the morning and why he was asking you for the car then?"" Wise asked. ""No,"" she replied. Those messages clearly upset her at the time, according to her responses, which prosecutors read aloud to jurors. ""I'm sorry daddy, I can't take this,"" she wrote. ""I just miss you and want to hang out with you."" On Oct. 12, 2018, Hunter Biden purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, a ""speedloader"" firearm accessory, and 25 rounds of ammunition from Wilmington, Delaware, gun store StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply, according to prosecutors. In the course of doing so, he filled out a federal form and checked a box signaling that he was not abusing drugs – the document at the heart of the government's case – despite allegedly knowing it to be untrue. Hunter Biden allegedly possessed the firearm for less than two weeks. On Oct. 23, his then-romantic partner Hallie Biden discovered the weapon and discarded it in a dumpster outside of Janssen's Market, a Wilmington grocery store, prosecutors allege. He later acknowledged in his 2021 memoir ""Beautiful Things"" that he was addicted to crack cocaine around that time. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
9,Max Zahn,Inflation expected to have held steady in May,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/inflation-expected-held-steady/story?id=111012785,"After a significant cooldown of inflation, prices have stalled in recent months.",2024-06-12T09:08:34Z,"Consumer prices rose 3.3% over the year ending in May, data showed. Consumer prices rose 3.3% in May compared to a year ago, easing slightly from the previous month and outperforming economists' expectations. The data arrived hours before the Federal Reserve is set to announce a decision about whether to move its benchmark interest rate. Price increases have slowed significantly from a peak of about 9%, but inflation still stands more than a percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.  The latest finding indicated a mild cooldown from the 3.4% annual inflation rate recorded in April. Core inflation -- a closely watched measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices -- increased 3.4% over the year ending in May, cooling notably from the previous month, the data showed. Extending a monthslong trend, food prices offered a bright spot in the inflation report. Food prices rose 2.1% over the year ending in May, coming in well below the overall inflation rate. Prices fell over the past year for kitchen table staples like rice, white bread, milk, fish and ham. By contrast, prices for beef, tomatoes and candy rose faster than the overall pace of inflation. For nearly a year, the Fed has held interest rates steady at their highest level since 2001, hoping that elevated borrowing costs would slow economic activity, reduce consumer demand and lower prices. Instead, the economy has hummed along and price increases have largely stalled. A jobs report released on Friday blew past economist expectations, demonstrating the resilient strength of the economy. Blockbuster hiring in May exceeded the average number of jobs added each month over the previous year, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Average hourly wages surged 4.1% over the year ending in May, the report found. That rate of pay increase exceeds the pace of inflation, indicating that the spending power of workers has grown even as prices jump. The data marks a boon for workers but could give pause to policymakers, since they fear that a rise in pay could prompt businesses to raise prices in order to cover the added labor cost. Economic output slowed markedly at the outset of 2024, though it continued to grow at a solid pace. The Fed, in turn, has all but abandoned a previous forecast of three interest rate cuts by the end of the year. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates, said last month that it does not anticipate cutting interest rates until it retains confidence that inflation is moving sustainably downward. ""So far the data has not given us that greater confidence,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month. ""It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected."" Economists expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady for the seventh consecutive time at the close of its meeting on Wednesday. The Fed risks a rebound of inflation if it cuts interest rates too quickly, since stronger consumer demand on top of solid economic activity could lead to an acceleration of price increases. A prolonged period of high interest rates, however, threatens to place downward pressure on economic growth and plunge the U.S. into a recession.  Price increases have drawn attention from voters as the U.S. hurtles toward what appears to be a closely contested presidential election in the fall. Eighty-five percent of U.S. adults surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos last month said inflation is an important issue, making it the second-highest priority among adults surveyed. The top priority, the economy, also relates to individuals' perceptions of price increases. On each of those issues, the economy and inflation, those surveyed by ABC News/Ipsos said they trusted former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden by a margin of 14 percentage points. ""Inflation is something that affects absolutely everybody,"" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the Governance Studies program at the Brookings Institution, previously told ABC News. ""People notice it, whether they're rich or poor."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
10,Lucien Bruggeman,"Timeline: Hunter Biden under legal, political scrutiny",https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-hunter-biden-legal-political-scrutiny/story?id=102293605,Here's a timeline of legal and political scrutiny President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has faced during a yearslong probe into his personal and professional life.,2024-06-11T11:34:31Z,"Prosecutors have been investigating the president's son since 2018. Six years into a federal probe of his personal and professional life, President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden is facing charges. U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Trump-era appointee who has since been elevated to special counsel, has indicted the younger Biden on felony gun charges as well as tax-related charges after a plea deal fell apart in a Delaware courtroom in July.  Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill are investigating the Biden family as part of their impeachment inquiry into the president. Here's a timeline of Hunter Biden's legal and political scrutiny. A month after Joe Biden wins the 2020 presidential election, Hunter Biden announces that federal prosecutors in Delaware are investigating his ""tax affairs."" A source with knowledge of the investigation tells ABC News that the tax probe began in 2018, but that the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware waited to notify Hunter Biden's legal team due to sensitivities around the election. Investigators are looking into Hunter's business dealings in China and elsewhere, including scrutinizing whether he may have committed tax crimes stemming from those overseas business dealings, sources tell ABC News. Outgoing Attorney General William Barr says he doesn't intend to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden, as President Donald Trump and others have suggested. In a new memoir, Hunter Biden addresses many of the topics that emerged as fodder for his father's political foes during the presidential campaign, including his struggles with substance addiction, his dealings in China, and his seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm during his father's tenure as vice president -- a role that later led to then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial on charges that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden's position on the board. Trump was subsequently acquitted. The memoir, titled ""Beautiful Things,"" also offers lurid details as it chronicles the younger Biden's repeated relapses into drug and alcohol abuse. ABC News reports that the federal investigation into Hunter Biden over his tax affairs has intensified, according to sources. Sources say a number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, as well as about how he paid off tax obligations in recent years. Fresh off the GOP regaining control of the Senate in the midterm elections, congressional Republicans say they're poised to push ahead with an investigation into President Joe Biden's family, including Hunter Biden, in the coming session. Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, two high-ranking members expected to helm powerful committees when Republicans take control of Congress in January, pledge to ""pursue all avenues"" of wrongdoing, calling investigations into the president's family a ""top priority."" Ahead of an expected deluge of Republican probes, Hunter Biden retains high-powered defense lawyer Abbe Lowell to help navigate congressional oversight. Testifying in his annual oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Merrick Garland says that U.S. Attorney David Weiss has been told he has ""full authority"" to make any charging decisions stemming from the Hunter Biden investigation, even if that would involve bringing a case in a district outside of Delaware. Garland also says he has pledged to Weiss any resources necessary to conduct his investigation, and has received no reports thus far of the his investigation being stymied in any way by personnel at the main Justice Department. Attorneys for Hunter Biden file counterclaims alleging invasion of privacy in response to a defamation lawsuit brought by Delaware-based computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac, who they say triggered the infamous laptop controversy in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election. The counterclaim is in response to an ongoing defamation lawsuit against Hunter Biden and others that was filed in October 2019 by Mac Isaac, who Hunter Biden's attorney say obtained and later disseminated data from a laptop allegedly belonging to the younger Biden. ABC News reports that a supervisor at the IRS has told lawmakers that he has information that suggests the Biden administration could be mishandling the investigation into Hunter Biden, according to sources. In a letter to lawmakers obtained by ABC News, the lawyer for the IRS whistleblower says his client is an IRS criminal supervisory special agent ""who has been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high-profile, controversial subject since early 2020 and would like to make protected whistleblower disclosures to Congress."" The letter says that ""The protected disclosures: (1) contradict sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee, (2) involve failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of the case, and (3) detail examples of preferential treatment and politics improperly infecting decisions and protocols that would normally be followed by career law enforcement professionals in similar circumstances if the subject were not politically connected."" ABC News reports that the GOP-led House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena demanding the FBI produce a record related to an alleged ""criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national."" The subpoena seeks an unclassified FD-1023 document, which is generally defined as a report from an informant. The White House denounces the contents of the document as ""anonymous innuendo."" Attorneys for the IRS whistleblower inform key members of Congress that their client -- along with his ""entire investigative team"" -- has been removed from the probe into the president's son. The Justice Department defers comment to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who does not comment on the claim. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announces his intention to initiate contempt of Congress hearings over FBI Director Chris Wray's refusal to physically turn over the FD-1023 document that Republicans believe is related to President Joe Biden. Hunter Biden agrees to plead guilty to a pair of tax-related misdemeanors and enter into a pretrial diversion agreement that would enable him to avoid prosecution on one felony gun charge, potentially ending the yearslong probe. According to the agreement, the younger Biden will acknowledge his failure to pay taxes on income he received in 2017 and 2018, until they were paid in 2020 by a third party, identified by ABC News as attorney and confidant Kevin Morris. In exchange, prosecutors will recommend probation, meaning Hunter Biden will likely avoid prison time. For the gun charge, he will agree to pretrial diversion, with the charge being dropped if he adheres to certain terms. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika sets a court date of July 26 for Hunter Biden to make his initial court appearance related to the plea deal he has agreed to. The GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee releases transcripts of their interviews with two IRS whistleblowers that they say show that senior Biden administration officials stymied U.S. Attorney David Weiss' investigation into Hunter Biden. In their testimony, the whistleblowers claim that senior Justice Department officials blocked prosecutors' attempts to bring charges against Hunter Biden in Washington and California, and refused to grant Weiss special counsel status. Justice Department officials dispute the claim, saying, ""As both the Attorney General and U.S. Attorney David Weiss have said, U.S. Attorney Weiss has full authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when, and whether to file charges as he deems appropriate. He needs no further approval to do so.""  ABC News reports that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has been given access the redacted FD-1023 document that allegedly contains claims about what Comer calls a ""criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions."" But Comer tells reporters that reading the document was ""a total waste of my time,"" as more than half of the document was redacted. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight panel, says the Trump-era Justice Department investigated the claims and, ""in August 2020, Attorney General [William] Barr and his hand-picked U.S. Attorney signed off on closing the assessment."" Congressional Republicans have also seized on a July 2017 WhatsApp message in which the younger Biden purportedly threatened a Chinese business associate by invoking his father's political connections, allegedly writing, ""I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand, and now means tonight."" ""And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang, or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction,"" the message continues. ""I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father."" At the time of the message, Joe Biden's term as vice president had already ended and he held no political office. But Republicans say the message undercuts President Biden's claim that he never discussed overseas business endeavors with his son. Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, reiterates that ""the president was not in business with his son."" Meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland disputes outright the IRS' whistleblowers' claim that Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss had requested to be named a special counsel but was turned down, saying, ""Mr. Weiss never made that request to me."" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, regarding the IRS whistleblowers' claim that Garland turned down Weiss' request to be named a special counsel in the Hunter Biden probe, tells Fox News, ""If it comes true what the IRS whistleblower is saying, we're going to start impeachment inquiries on the attorney general.""  ABC News reports that Weiss has pushed back on the IRS whistleblowers' allegations, writing in a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham of the Senate Judiciary Committee: ""To clarify an apparent misperception and to avoid future confusion, I wish to make one point clear: in this case, I have not requested Special Counsel designation."" Separately, in an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray is asked by Rep. Matt Gaetz, ""Are you protecting the Bidens?"" ""Absolutely not,"" Wray answers. Hunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell sends a cease-and-desist letter to Trump's legal team claiming that Trump's rhetoric on social media and elsewhere ""could lead to [Hunter Biden's] or his family's injury."" ""This is not a false alarm,"" Lowell writes. ""You should make clear to Mr. Trump -- if you have not done so already -- that Mr. Trump's words have caused harm in the past and threaten to do so again if he does not stop."" In congressional testimony, the two IRS whistleblowers -- 14-year IRS veteran Gary Shapley and IRS investigator Joseph Ziegler, who has previously been unidentified -- reiterate their claims that Justice Department officials stymied Weiss' probe of Hunter Biden. ""It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited and marginalized by DOJ officials,"" Ziegler says. ""I still think that a special counsel is necessary for this investigation."" In an unusual move, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, releases the FD-1023 document containing a confidential FBI informant's unverified claim that, years ago, the Biden family ""pushed"" a Ukrainian oligarch to pay them millions of dollars. The document cites an unnamed source who says that in 2015, Mykola Zlochevsky, the chief executive of Burisma -- the Ukrainian energy firm that hired Hunter Biden as a board member in 2013 -- claimed that he was ""forced"" to pay Joe and Hunter Biden $5 million each, apparently in exchange for orchestrating the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor named Viktor Shokin who was purportedly investigating Burisma at the time. The assertion that the elder Biden, who was then vice president, acted to have Shokin removed in an effort to protect Burisma has been undercut by widespread criticism of the former Ukrainian prosecutor that led the U.S. State Department itself to seek Shokin's ouster. A White House spokesperson, responding to the document's release, says ""congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.""  Under questioning from reporters, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre reiterates that President Biden ""was never in business with his son."" Hunter Biden appears before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to formally agree to the plea deal negotiated in June -- but during a contentious hearing, Judge Noreika defers the deal after taking issue with the structure of the arrangement. Noreika requests additional briefings from the parties before she'll determine next steps. In the meantime, Hunter Biden enters a plea of not guilty. Former Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer testifies before the House Oversight panel, telling legislators that Burisma, through Hunter Biden, benefitted by its association with the so-called ""Biden brand"" -- but that Hunter Biden only provided the ""illusion of access"" to his father and did not discuss his business dealings with him, according to committee members who participated in the closed-door hearing. House Republicans release the complete transcript of Devon Archer's testimony before the Oversight panel, which include his recollection that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone or referenced his father being on the phone in front of business associates ""maybe 20 times"" in the 10 years that Archer and Hunter Biden were business associates -- which included a period when Biden was vice president -- but that Joe Biden's interactions with Hunter Biden's associates were ""not related to commercial business"" and that Joe Biden had no involvement with Burisma or took any actions to benefit Burisma or Hunter Biden, according to the fully transcribed interview with the committee. Archer confirms that he was not aware of any wrongdoing by President Biden, according to the transcription. Attorney General Merrick Garland appoints Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel in his investigation of Hunter Biden, after the Trump appointee asked Garland to be appointed special counsel in the case. Weiss says in court documents filed within minutes of his appointment that plea negotiations have reached ""an impasse"" and that he intends to drop the misdemeanor tax charges against Hunter Biden in Delaware and instead bring them in California and Washington, D.C., where prosecutors say the alleged misconduct occurred.  Attorneys for Hunter Biden say in a court filing that federal prosecutors reneged on the plea deal that would have resolved tax and gun charges against Hunter Biden. Despite their acknowledgement that the plea agreement on tax charges is ""moot,"" attorneys for Hunter Biden argue that the second part of the deal -- a diversion agreement on a separate gun charge -- remains in effect, since it is a separate contract negotiated and entered into by the parties outside the judge's purview. In court filings, prosecutors for Weiss push back on Hunter Biden's assertion that they ""reneged"" on the ill-fated plea deal, and dispute defense counsel's claim that the diversion agreement on a gun possession charge remains ""valid and binding."" Court documents filed by special counsel David Weiss say that Weiss intends to bring an indictment against Hunter Biden by the end of the month, pertaining to the felony gun charge that was previously brought under the pretrial diversion agreement brokered by the two parties. Hunter Biden's legal team argues that the pretrial diversion agreement remains in effect. ""We believe the signed and filed diversion agreement remains valid and prevents any additional charges from being filed against Mr. Biden,"" says Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Hunter Biden. ""We expect a fair resolution of the sprawling, 5-year investigation into Mr. Biden that was based on the evidence and the law, not outside political pressure."" Hunter Biden is indicted by special counsel David Weiss on felony charges that he lied on a federal form when he said he was drug-free at the time that he purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver in October 2018. His legal team maintains that the pretrial diversion agreement from July remains in effect, though Weiss' team says it's null and void. ""As expected, prosecutors filed charges today that they deemed were not warranted just six weeks ago following a five-year investigation into this case,"" Hunter Biden attorney Abbe Lowell says in a statement. ""We believe these charges are barred by the agreement the prosecutors made with Mr. Biden, the recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional, and the facts that he did not violate that law, and we plan to demonstrate all of that in court."" Hunter Biden files a lawsuit against the IRS over alleged ""unlawful disclosures"" made by the pair of whistleblowers who accused government prosecutors of mishandling their investigation into him. Hunter Biden's attorney files court papers seeking to have his client's arraignment, scheduled for Oct. 3 in a Delaware court, take place via video conference instead of in person. A judge denies Hunter Biden's effort to avoid appearing in person at his arraignment on federal gun charges, ordering him to appear at a hearing scheduled for Oct. 3. The same day, Attorney General Merrick Garland, testifying for five hours before the House Judiciary Committee, is grilled by GOP lawmakers about his department's handling of criminal probes into Hunter Biden and others. Garland pushes back on GOP claims that he's taken any directives from the White House, saying, ""I am not the president's lawyer. I am not Congress' prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people. Our job is to follow the facts and the law, and that is what we do."" Hunter Biden files a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, accusing the former Trump attorney of computer fraud over his role in obtaining and sharing the alleged contents of the infamous laptop. In a statement responding to the suit, Giuliani adviser Ted Goodman says, ""I'm not surprised he's now falsely claiming his laptop hard drive was manipulated by Mayor Giuliani, considering the sordid material and potential evidence of crimes on that thing."" Hunter Biden, appearing in the same Delaware courthouse where his federal plea deal with prosecutors fell apart over the summer, formally enters a plea of not guilty to the three felony gun charges that were part of the original plea agreement. ABC News reports that Hunter Biden is urging the Justice Department to investigate his former business associate Tony Bobulinski over claims that Bobulinski lied to federal investigators during an interview in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election when he alleged that the Bidens had lied to the public about the nature of then-candidate Joe Biden's involvement in Hunter Biden's proposed overseas business ventures. Hunter Biden is subpoenaed by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer to appear before the committee, along with his former business associate Rob Walker, President Biden's brother James Biden, and other members of the Biden family. Hunter Biden's attorneys file a motion seeking court approval to issue subpoenas to former President Donald Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, and two ex-Justice Department officials for documents they say could shed light on whether the federal gun charges Hunter Biden is facing were the result of ""a vindictive or selective prosecution arising from an unrelenting pressure campaign beginning in the last administration."" ABC News reports that special counsel David Weiss is using a Los Angeles-based federal grand jury to pursue the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs, according to sources. The grand jury has issued a subpoena to James Biden, the brother of President Joe Biden, as part of the probe, a source says. Responding to his subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee, Hunter Biden, in a letter from his attorney to Republican lawmakers, says he is willing to testify before the panel -- but only in a public forum. Special counsel David Weiss files nine tax-related charges against Hunter Biden, accusing him of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2020. The indictment alleges that the younger Biden earned millions of dollars from foreign entities and ""spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle at the same time he chose not to pay his taxes."" Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, claims the 56-page indictment includes ""no new evidence"" and says, ""Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought."" Attorneys representing Hunter Biden ask a federal judge to dismiss three felony gun charges he faces in Delaware. The president's son pleaded not guilty to all three charges in October, after Weiss indicted him on the charges in September. As GOP lawmakers convene to depose Hunter Biden in a closed-door session that he has informed them he won't attend, he addresses members of the media outside the U.S. Capitol and slams House Republicans for refusing to allow him to answer questions in a public forum, saying, ""I am here to testify at a public hearing today, to answer any of the committees' legitimate questions."" Hunter Biden makes a surprise appearance at a hearing of the GOP-led House Oversight Committee on whether to hold him in contempt of Congress for refusing a subpoena to testify before the committee behind closed doors. The committee approves a resolution recommending he be held in contempt for his refusal of provide closed-door testimony. Hunter Biden, appearing in federal court in Los Angeles, enters a plea of not guilty to the nine felony and misdemeanor tax charges in special counsel David Weiss' December indictment. Special counsel David Weiss' office issues a biting rebuttal to Hunter Biden's attempt to have the three felony gun charges against him thrown out, calling his selective prosecution claim ""a fiction designed for a Hollywood script."" The filing comes on the same day that the Justice Department files a motion seeking to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by Hunter Biden against the Internal Revenue Service over its alleged failure to protect his tax information from disclosure by the two whistleblowers who accused the Biden administration of mishandling the probe into the president's son. Hunter Biden, after weeks of back-and-forth with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, agrees to sit for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 28, avoiding the threat of contempt of Congress charges. A longtime business partner of Hunter Biden, Eric Schwerin, tells the House Oversight Committee in a closed-door interview that he is ""not aware of any financial transactions or compensation"" that then-Vice President Joe Biden received related to business conducted by this family members. Tony Bobulinski, the onetime business associate of Hunter Biden who has become a critic of the Biden family, testifies before the House Oversight Committee, reiterating claims he made during the 2020 election that Joe Biden was ""an enabler"" of several of his family's overseas business schemes that ""sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government."" Special counsel David Weiss indicts Alexander Smirnov, an FBI confidential source who provided derogatory information about President Biden and his son Hunter Biden, on felony false statement and obstruction charges. Smirnov is the same person that Republicans have called ""a highly credible FBI source"" and have used to claim Joe Biden is corrupt, multiple senior congressional sources tell ABC News. Attorneys for Hunter Biden move to dismiss the tax-related charges brought by special counsel David Weiss in California, accusing prosecutors of selectively targeting the younger Biden, violating a statute of limitations, and filing duplicative charges on three counts of failure to pay and tax evasion. In a court filing, special counsel David Weiss says that one-time FBI informant Alexander Smirnov had high-level Russian contacts and that, following his arrest the week before, Smirnov told the FBI that ""officials with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story"" about Hunter Biden. A measured and defiant Hunter Biden addresses a litany of allegations during six hours of closed-door testimony before the GOP-led House Oversight and Judiciary committees. The deposition appears to include no major bombshells as he repeatedly invokes his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction -- telling the committee he is ""embarrassed"" by some of his conduct at the time -- while vehemently and repeatedly denying that his father had any involvement in his business life. A week after Hunter Biden's closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer invites him to appear for a public hearing on March 20. Special counsel David Weiss files his rebuttal to efforts by Hunter Biden to have his nine tax-related charges in California dismissed, slamming his arguments in court filings as a ""conspiracy theory,"" a ""house of cards,"" and ""shapeshifting claims."" A week after his closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee as part of their impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden, through his attorney, declines an invitation by congressional Republicans to testify in public -- but suggests he would attend a hearing on foreign influence peddling if lawmakers also invited members of former President Donald Trump's family. The development comes on the same day that the judge overseeing Hunter Biden's felony gun case in Delaware tentatively schedules his trial for June 3 -- just weeks before his Los Angeles-based tax trial is scheduled to begin on June 20. Judge Mark Scarsi, the federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden's tax case in California, hears several defense motions to dismiss the charges and says afterward that he will issue a ruling by April 17. Judge Scarsi denies all eight of Hunter Biden's motions to dismiss his nine-count tax indictment in California, paving the way for a June 20 trial. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika denies attempts by Hunter Biden to dismiss the three federal gun charges he faces, all but ensuring he will stand trial in June. Attorneys representing Hunter Biden threaten to sue Fox News for violating ""revenge porn"" laws and publishing since-discredited bribery allegations as part of a scheme to ""paint him in a false light,"" according to a letter obtained by ABC News. Special counsel David Weiss’ office suggests in court papers that they will call multiple women who had relationships with Hunter Biden to testify in his upcoming felony gun trial, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and the widow of his late brother Beau Biden, Hallie Biden. Prosecutors say in a court filing that they plan to use Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence in his upcoming felony gun trial to help them prove that he unlawfully obtained a firearm in 2018. The development comes on the same day that U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi grants Hunter Biden's request to postpone his Los Angeles trial on tax charges until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election. A jury of six woman and six men is sworn in on Day 1 of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial in Delaware, where the president's son is accused of lying on an ATF form when he said he was not using drugs at the time of his gun purchase in 2018. Prosecutors enter Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence on Day 2 of the trial, with an FBI special agent testifying that investigators were able confirm the laptop was his by matching its serial number to his iCloud account. Prosecutors cite messages found on the laptop to argue that Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs at the time of his 2018 gun purchase, and also play audiobook excerpts from his 2021 memoir in which he discusses his past drug use. But the FBI witness acknowledges under cross-examination that she cannot verify that his drug use was continuous during that period. Prosecution witnesses Kathleen Buhle and Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden's ex-wife and ex-girlfriend, testify on Day 3 of the trial about Hunter Biden's drug use to bolster the government's argument that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun in Delaware in October 2018. Kestan, however, concedes on cross-examination that she had ""no idea"" what Hunter Biden was up to from Sept. 23, when he left California for Delaware, until November, when the two reconnected. Hallie Biden, the widow of President Joe Biden's late son Beau Biden who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden at the time he purchased the gun at the center of the case, testifies on Day 4 of the trial about how she discovered the firearm in Hunter Biden's vehicle on Oct. 23, 2018, and, in a panic, disposed of it in a trash receptacle outside a local supermarket. She tells jurors that she also found ""remnants"" of crack in Hunter Biden's vehicle at the time she discovered the gun -- but acknowledges under cross-examination that she did not see Hunter Biden abusing drugs or alcohol for most of the month of October, potentially undercutting the prosecution's contention that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun on Oct. 12. After the government rests it case, Hunter Biden's daughter Naomi Biden, testifying for the defense, tells jurors on Day 5 of the trial that her dad ""seemed great"" just days after he purchased the Colt revolver at the center of the case -- but her testimony under cross-examination suggests that drug remnants found in his truck by his then-girlfriend Hallie Biden 11 days after the gun purchase likely came from him. The defense rests its case without Hunter Biden taking the stand on Day 6 of the trial. Prosecutors tell the jury in closing arguments that Hunter Biden ""knew he was using drugs"" when he said otherwise on the gun-purchase form, while the defense argues that prosecutors failed to ""fill in the gaps"" about Hunter Biden's drug use around the time of the gun purchase ""because they don't have the proof."" Hunter Biden is found guilty on all three counts in his federal gun case: two counts of making false statements for saying on a federal form that he was not addicted to drugs at the time he purchased the firearm at the center of the case, and a third count of illegally obtaining the firearm while addicted to drugs. President Joe Biden says he will accept the outcome of the case ""and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
11,Alexandra Hutzler,Biden to offer forceful defense of democracy in Normandy speech commemorating D-Day,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-offer-forceful-defense-democracy-normandy-speech-commemorating/story?id=110923613,ABC's Mary Bruce reports the contrasts with Donald Trump will be clear.,2024-06-07T13:15:17Z,"""I refuse to believe America's greatness is a thing of the past,"" he said. President Joe Biden, in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, offered a forceful defense of democracy at a site of American heroism during World War II in a speech that carried 2024 political undertones for those watching in the U.S. Biden on Friday spoke from Pointe du Hoc, where Army Rangers scaled 100-foot cliffs to seize the German ammunition that could have been used against troops at Omaha and Utah beaches.  ""As we gather here today, it's not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day June 6, 1944,"" Biden said. ""It's to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us and they're summoning us now. They're asking us what will we do? They're not asking us to scale these cliffs. They're asking us to stay true to what America stands for."" ""They're not asking us to do their job. They're asking us to do our job,"" Biden continued. ""Protect freedom in our time, defend democracy, stand up to aggression abroad and at home, be part of something bigger than ourselves."" It was the same backdrop where Ronald Reagan, the first U.S. president to visit the shores of Normandy to mark the anniversary of allied forces invading occupied France, gave an iconic speech lauding the men who fought there and warning about the dangers of isolationism in the battle against totalitarianism. Biden similarly spoke of the soldiers' bravery, and of the principles of American democracy and leadership on the world stage. Biden put democracy front and center of his 2020 campaign for the White House and is doing so again in his reelection bid, pushing back against former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda. Biden didn't mention Trump by name in his address but sought to make that contrast clear. ""When we talk about American democracy, we often talk about the ideals of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. What we don't talk about is how hard it is … The most natural instinct is to walk away, to be selfish, to force our will upon others to seize power, never give up,"" Biden said. ""My fellow Americans, I refuse to believe, I simply refuse to believe that America's greatness is a thing of the past,"" he added. Biden also drew a connection between World War II and threats facing eastern Europe with Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression in Ukraine. Hours before his speech, Biden met face-to-face with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reiterate unwavering U.S. support for the war-torn nation. At the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the troops who stormed Normandy decided to believe in something bigger than themselves, and that they would want the same against modern-day challenges.  ""They stood against Hitler's aggression. Does anyone doubt, does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against Putin's aggression here in Europe today?"" Biden said. ""They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the 30s and 40s,"" he added. ""Does anyone doubt they wouldn't move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?"" In the crowd on Friday was veteran John Wardell, a New Jersey native who became a private first class and fought in the Battle of Brest. Biden thanked Wardell for his service, prompting applause from the audience. ""You deserve that and a lot more, John,"" Biden said. Wardell told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce the experience was an ""honor"" and humbly insisted he was “just a small part” of that history. Wardell said his message to the next generation was, “Let’s see what they do. I hope they honor what’s happened here in years past and are made to realize. Read a little history. I hope that they do.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The front power seat motor on the affected Tellurides from the 2020-2024 model years may overheat because of a stuck slide knob, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That could potentially result in a fire while the car is parked or being driven. Kia made the decision to recall the vehicles on May 29, NHTSA documents published Friday show, after receiving reports of one under-seat fire and six incidents of localized melting in the seat tilt motor between August 2022 and March 2024. No related injuries, crashes or fatalities were reported at the time. The recall report notes that strong external impact to the recalled Tellurides' front power seat side cover or seat slide knob can result in internal misalignment — and with continuous operation, that can cause overheating. People driving vehicles with the issue may find they can't adjust the power seat, may notice a burning or melting smell, or see smoke rising from underneath the seat. To fix this, dealers will install a bracket for the power seat switch back covers and replace the seat slide knobs at no cost. Until the vehicles are repaired, owners are being instructed to park their cars outside and away from buildings. Owner notification letters are set to be mailed out starting July 30, with dealer notification a few days prior. Irvine, California-based Kia America did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment on why these notifications wouldn't begin until the end of next month. In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site and/or Kia’s recall lookup platform.  The recall covers 462,869 model year 2020-2024 Tellurides that were manufactured between Jan. 9, 2019 and May 29, 2024. Kia America estimates that 1% have the defect. This isn’t the only recall impacting Kia Telluride owners. In March, Kia America said it would be recalling more than 427,000 of 2020-2024 Telluride SUVs due to a defect that may cause the cars to roll away while they’re parked. Just last fall, Kia and Hyundai announced previous “park outside” recalls for 3.4 million other car and SUV models due to the danger of engine compartment fires. Amid long-delayed repairs, many of those vehicles remained on the road months later, posing serious concerns from drivers and consumer safety advocates. Hyundai owns part of Kia, though the two companies operate independently. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Three swimmers, including two teens, were attacked by sharks in two separate incidents while they were at beaches in Walton County, Florida, on Friday, the authorities said. A 45-year-old woman was swimming just past a sandbar with her husband at Watersound Beach when she was bitten by a shark around 1:20 p.m., South Walton Fire District Chief Ryan Crawford told reporters. The unidentified woman sustained ""significant trauma"" to the midsection of her body, and part of her left arm had to be amputated, Crawford said. She was transported to HCA Fort Walton-Destin Hospital in critical condition. Around 90 minutes later near Seacrest Beach, which is just four miles from Watersound Beach, a 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old girl were with a group of friends near the first sandbar in waist-deep water when they were injured by a shark, according to Crawford.  One victim was bitten by a shark and sustained ""significant injuries,"" and was flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola Hospital in critical condition, Crawford said. The second victim sustained flesh wounds to her foot and was transported to Ascension Bay Medical Center in stable condition. Walton County Sheriff Michael A. Adkinson, Jr. told reporters that officials ordered beaches to be closed after the first incident, however, the order was not fully enacted in time before the teens were attacked. Authorities also said that the process of changing the beach warning flags along the coastline would have taken about an hour and a half to complete. Sheriff Adkinson Jr. said the last shark attack in the county was back in 2021 and the last shark-related fatality was in 2005.  ""This is an anomaly ... everything from it being three victims, to where it's at,"" the sheriff said. ""All we can do is respond control, and mitigate what we can."" Walton County authorities have reached out to ocean wildlife experts at Mote Marine in Pensacola, Florida, to help in the investigation of the incident, Sheriff Adkinson Jr. said. Walton County officials reopened the beaches Saturday with extra patrols in the water and red and purple flags to warn swimmers. ""It is important to us that beach patrons recognize and understand the risk of the open water as it pertains not just to surf hazards, but marine life. We ask you to remain situationally aware at all times,"" South Walton Fire District said in a statement. The Bay County Sheriff's Office also announced double red flag warnings for its beaches Saturday and had more information on what may be attracting the sharks. ""Sheriff Tommy Ford has been in conversation with [the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission] and has learned that bait fish are schooling near the shore at this time of year which may have been a contributing factor in the attacks,"" the office said in a statement. Florida's shark attacks weren't the only incidents reported Friday. A 25-year-old woman was rushed to a hospital after she suffered a shark bite off Oahu’s North Shore around 2 p.m. local time, according to Honolulu Emergency Services. ""EMS met the patient at the Haleiwa Small Boat Harbor, where she was brought to shore. EMS treated her multiple serious lacerations and transported her to an emergency room,"" the agency said in a statement. The unidentified victim's condition was unknown as of Saturday afternoon ABC News' Erica Morris and Amanda Morris contributed to this report.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Israeli special forces were disguised as Palestinian refugees looking for a place to live when they entered the buildings where hostages were being held during the Israeli rescue operation this weekend, two Israeli security sources told ABC News. Special forces were already in position near the buildings where the hostages were being held before they were given the ""go"" command by Israeli forces, the sources added.  The ""go"" command was given Saturday at 11 a.m. local time, sources said. The helicopters carrying the hostages and wounded police officers landed at Sheba Medical Center in Israel starting at 12:15 p.m. local time and the last helicopter landed at 12:45 p.m. local time. The Shin Bet, Israel's internal security forces, Israel Defense Forces and Israeli SWAT team members, called YAMAM, participated in the rescue operation, now called ""Operation Arnon"" by the Israeli military. The name of the operation was given to honor the one security officer who was killed during the operation. The rescued hostages -- Almog Meir Jan, 21; Noa Argamani, 25; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 40 -- had all been abducted from the Nova music festival in Israel on Oct. 7.  They were in ""good medical condition"" when they were rescued, IDF officials said. Physically the hostages were ""in less severe condition"" than the Israeli hospital and doctors treating the hostages ""prepared for,"" Professor Itai Pessach, head of the medical team who has been taking care of the hostages at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, told ABC News' Tom Soufi Burridge on Monday. ""They've endured physical, abuse. Throughout the period,"" Pessach told ABC News. ""They underwent continuous, psychological abuse."" The hostages were rescued from two separate locations in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, the IDF said. The three male hostages were rescued from one location, and Argamani was rescued from a separate location. That camp has become home to thousands of refugees who've fled fighting throughout Gaza. Officials with the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said on Sunday that at least 274 Palestinians had been killed during the IDF operation in Nuseirat and 698 people were injured.

An Austrian Airlines flight suffered significant damage from hail, which took off part of the airplane's nose on Sunday, the airline said. Flight OS434 was flying from Palma de Mallorca, Spain, to Vienna, Austria, when it hit a ""thunderstorm cell,"" Austrian Airlines said in a statement to ABC News. The hail caused damage to the cockpit windows, some coverings and the nose, which photos showed appeared to have broken off. ""I think we were about 20 minutes from landing when we got into a cloud of hail and thunderstorm, and the turbulence started,"" Emmeley Oakley, a passenger on the flight, told ABC News via text message. Oakley said that inside the cabin, they could hear the hail as it hit their aircraft. ""We could definitely feel the hail coming down on the plane and it was quite loud and ofc super rocky for a minute,"" Oakley wrote.  As the plane -- an Airbus A320 -- was going through the severe weather patch, which the airline said was not visible on the radar to the cockpit crew, a Mayday call was made due to the damage. Oakley estimated the plane took about two minutes or less to fly through the hailstorm, which caused ""phones and cups"" to fly around the plane. Some people screamed, Oakley said, and the flight attendants stepped in to help. ""The cabin crew did a really good job calming those people down though,"" Oakley wrote. Despite the rocky final leg, the plane landed safely at Vienna-Schwechat Airport, with no passengers harmed, Austrian Airlines said.  ""It was a pretty uneventful flight for 90% of the trip,"" Oakley said. Austrian Airlines' technical team is currently inspecting the damage. ""It wasn’t until we exited that we saw the nose was missing!

Moderna's combo flu and COVID vaccine provided a strong immune response in older adults, with levels comparable to getting the flu and COVID shots separately, according to the company's results from a late-stage clinical trial. There are still multiple steps required before the shot would become available. Moderna would need to apply to the FDA for approval, which may require input from the FDA's independent panel of experts. If authorized or approved, the shot would also need to be greenlit by the CDC before becoming available. The clinical trial was done in 8,000 adults. Half of those adults were 65 years and older and the other half were between the ages of 50 and 64. Older adults are especially at risk for severe illness from respiratory illnesses including hospitalization and death. The combo vaccine was compared to already approved and available flu and COVID vaccines.  Everyone over the age of 6 months was recommended to get a flu shot and updated COVID shot last season. The CDC is expected to make new recommendations again this fall for both the flu and COVID vaccine. While both the COVID and flu vaccine can be given separately during the same visit, a combination shot may be preferred for some patients. The most commonly reported side effects of Moderna's combo shot were injection site pain, fatigue, muscle pain and headache. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Some 44 horses were killed and one person seriously injured when a fire engulfed a horse barn Saturday in Logan County, Ohio. Brant Performance Horses near Belle Center, Ohio, about an hour northwest of Columbus, used a barn that measured about 60,000 square feet and stabled about 85 horses. It also featured a performing area for the horses and a living space for employees. Firefighters from Logan, Hardin and Union counties worked together to extinguish the barn fire, according to Jason Johns, assistant fire chief of the Richland Township Fire Department. The fire was first noticed around noon Saturday by a Brant Performance Horses employee, according to Cathy Brant of Brant Performance Horses. ""An employee was in the barn, saw smoke and yelled fire,"" Brant told ABC News. She said an explosion occurred only seconds later and generated a larger fire. Eric Priest, owner of Priest Performances Horses in Belle Center, who kept some of his horses at the barn, ran inside to attempt to free the horses and was caught in the explosion. He sustained second- and third-degree burns to his arms, back and head, according to Brant, and faces possible surgery.  Firefighters were at the scene for about 12 hours on Saturday. ""Slowly but surely we were getting the fire to calm down,"" Johns told ABC News. ""The building was already starting to collapse and it wasn't safe to enter."" Four employees lived in the building and lost everything, Brant said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. A GoFundMe page created for the owners of Brant Performance Horses had raised just over $235,000 as of Monday afternoon, while two GoFundMe pages created for the owners of Priest Performance Horses had together raised nearly $40,000 by Monday afternoon. ""The amount of the support is incredible,"" said Brant, who added that the money will be used to rebuild the property.

Apple unveiled artificial intelligence-fueled features across several key products on Monday, heralding the long-awaited entry of the tech giant into the high-stakes AI race. The latest version of Apple's operating system will deliver customizable tools using generative AI for iPhones, Mac and iPad, Apple said at the Worldwide Developers Conference hosted at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Language tools will be able to improve or summarize text, and image generators will supplement photos with extra adornment. The AI capability, called Apple Intelligence, amounts to the ""next big step for Apple,"" CEO Tim Cook said on Monday. The advance results from an agreement between Apple and OpenAI, the firm behind popular text bot ChatGPT, Cook added. A revamped Siri, for instance, will draw on generative chat technology to improve its language comprehension and retain context from previous requests, the company said. Since its launch in 2011, Siri has functioned primarily as a hands-free tool for responses to specific prompts, such as queries about the weather or a user's upcoming calendar. The new version, Apple said, will carry out extended conversations and aid in intricate tasks. Further, Siri will be able to take actions within a user's product, pulling up photos or adding text to the Notes app, the company said.  Apple, the world's second largest company in terms of market capitalization, has lagged behind its behemoth competitors in the battle to develop and offer AI products. OpenAI retains a longstanding partnership with Microsoft, which holds a minority stake in the firm and integrates ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. Last year, Google announced its own AI model called Bard, which provides brief summaries in response to some search queries. The announcement on Monday amounts to the most important decision for Apple -- and Cook -- over the last decade, Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, told clients in a research note ahead of the conference. ""The pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center,"" Ives said. The fresh product arrives at a moment of relatively sluggish performance for Apple. In its latest earnings report, Apple last month revealed a sales slump for some of its mainstay products. Smartphone sales dropped 10% over the three months ending in March, when compared with the same period a year earlier. iPad sales fell 17% over that period, the earnings report said. In recent years, the company has relied on new models of its signature items, instead of transitioning to the next big product, analysts previously told ABC News.  The approach allows Apple to capitalize upon its loyal customer base and popular devices while it develops new products like Apple Vision Pro, the company's mixed reality headset, analysts said. With a starting cost of $3,499 and a higher-powered version at around $4,000, Apple Vision Pro remains far from a price point that would make it affordable for a wide audience. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

""The police initially determined that this case was an isolated incident and is currently under further investigation.” A 55-year-old suspect ""collided"" or ""bumped into"" one of the instructors and then proceeded to attack that instructor and three others with a knife, the Jilin Public Security Bureau said Tuesday. A Chinese tourist was also injured and the suspect was arrested, police said. Cornell College has a partnership with Beihua University and the instructors were accompanied by a local faculty member when the incident occurred, the university said. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner confirmed to ABC News that his brother, David Zabner, was one of the four stabbing victims. In a post on Instagram, Adam Zabner said he spoke to his brother by phone and that he is ""doing well"" as he recovers from a stabbing wound to the arm. Adam Zabner said his brother is a Ph.D. student at Tufts University and was in China as part of a teaching program between Cornell College and Beihua University. ""My family is incredibly grateful that David survived this attack. We'd like to see David home in lowa as soon as possible,"" Adam Zabner said in the Instagram post. ""We're deeply thankful to the state department and lowa's federal delegation and understand that they are working hard to make that happen. We also appreciate the support of friends and family who have reached out in the last 24 hours."" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds released a statement on X Monday, saying she's been in contact with Iowa’s federal delegation and the state department ""in response to this horrifying attack."" ""Please pray for their full recovery, safe return, and their families here at home,"" Reynolds wrote.  In a statement, the Department of State said it was ""aware of reports of a stabbing incident in Jilin, People's Republic of China."" ""We are monitoring the situation and have no further comments at this time,"" the department's statement read. Lin, the Chinese official, said cultural exchanges such as the one the instructors were undertaking were ""in the common interests"" of the U.S. and China. ""China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China,"" Lin said. ""The sporadic cases will not affect the normal development of Sino-US cultural exchanges."" Cornell College is a private liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, Iowa.

A 73-year-old Miami man is suspected of shooting a worker at the apartment building where he lives and intentionally starting a fire that quickly engulfed the complex, according to court documents. The fire was reported around 8:15 a.m. ET on Monday at Temple Court Apartments, according to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. More than 125 firefighters battled the blaze for approximately eight hours, he said during a press briefing Monday evening announcing the suspect's apprehension. First responders found a man who had been shot inside the building. He was transported to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the torso in critical condition, authorities said. The victim is an employee of the complex, according to the property's manager, Atlantic Housing Foundation, which said it was ""shocked and saddened"" by the fire and shooting. A resident of the apartment building, Juan Francisco Figueroa, was arrested in connection with the shooting and fire, according to an arrest affidavit. He faces multiple charges -- including attempted felony murder, first-degree arson and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon -- and was ordered held on no bond during a hearing on Tuesday, online court records show. Attorney information was not immediately available. Figueroa was allegedly seen running from the scene by a resident of the building the morning of the shooting, according to an arrest affidavit. Another resident came out of his apartment after hearing gunshots and found the victim on the first floor suffering from a gunshot wound and referring to Figueroa by his apartment number, according to the affidavit. The resident also saw an ""explosion"" following the gunshots, the affidavit said. Detectives conducted a traffic stop on Figueroa's vehicle around 4 p.m. ET and he was allegedly found carrying a revolver, according to the affidavit. He allegedly told detectives that he ""knew what he had done and expected to be in prison for the rest of his life,"" the affidavit stated.  The three-alarm fire was the first of that level in the city in 25 years, according to Suarez. Responding firefighters rescued more than 40 people, including some from their balconies, the mayor said, calling their actions ""heroic."" Firefighters conducted seven ladder rescues, he said. Firefighters discovered the fire on the third floor of the apartment building, according to Miami Fire-Rescue spokesperson Lt. Pete Sanchez. The building is a wood-frame structure, which ""explains the intensity and the rapid spread of the fire,"" he said. All residents of the building, most of whom are elderly, have been accounted for, Suarez said. The cause of the blaze remains under investigation. Three firefighters were transported to a local hospital in stable condition for further evaluation, according to Sanchez. Two have since been released, he said Monday afternoon. A resident was also transported to a hospital for smoke inhalation, Sanchez said. The property's management company is renting a hotel for the next two weeks for the 43 residents displaced by the fire, according to the mayor. ""We are still determining the cause of these events, and we are checking for other injuries,"" Atlantic Housing Foundation said in a statement. ""Police are investigating, and we will help in whatever ways we can."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The husband of the owner of the New York City day care where a 1-year-old died of fentanyl poisoning pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges, officials said. In September 2023, Felix Herrera Garcia was seen fleeing the Bronx day care out a back alley, carrying two heavy shopping bags while children were suffering from the effects of fentanyl, officials said. Herrera Garcia fled to Mexico after the death and was eventually arrested in Mexico after a weeklong manhunt. A 1-year-old boy, Nicholas Dominici, died, and three other children, ranging in age from 8 months to 2 years, were hospitalized and treated with Narcan, police said.  Herrera Garcia, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death, one count of possession with intent to distribute resulting in death and one count of possession with intent to distribute resulting in serious bodily injury, officials said. All three counts carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison. The guilty plea came on the day Herrera Garcia's trial was set to begin, according to Bronx County District Attorney Darcel Clark. ""Herrera Garcia has now been held accountable in the tragic loss of little Nicholas, the serious injury of Abel, and the harm to Kiara and Jaziel,"" Clark said in a statement.  Fentanyl was stored, in part, in a trapdoor beneath the day care floor, officials said. Investigators also found a kilo of fentanyl stored on kids' play mats, according to court documents. Herrera Garcia’s wife, Grei Mendez, pulled their 2-year old son from her own day care prior to the incident after she worried he was exhibiting signs of fentanyl exposure. Mendez never reported the suspected exposure to police, according to sources, and did not allow the boy to return to the facility. However, she kept the day care open for other children. Cases are pending against Mendez and her cousin. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
23,ABC NEWS,Kelley Robinson says 2024 election is crucial for members of LGBTQ+ community,https://abcnews.go.com/US/human-rights-campaign-president-2024-election-crucial-members/story?id=110927226,ABC News’ Andrew Dymburt speaks with Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson about anti-LGBTQ legislation around the country and how the group is reaching voters.,2024-06-10T18:26:05Z,"Kelley Robinson says there are proposed bills that are anti-LGBTQ. Last year, for the first time, the Human Rights Campaign declared a national state of emergency for LGBTQ+ people. The organization's president, Kelley Robinson, sat down with ABC News to discuss the specific bans being proposed that can effect the LGBTQ community. Robinson says she has spoken with pediatricians who have received death threats and also mentioned that teachers and drag queens are encountering threats of violence, such as being met with AR-15 rifles when they go to work. Robinson, however, said things started to turn around this year when ""bad bills"" targeting the LGBTQ community did not pass. She says this upcoming election is crucial because legislation is being proposed that could affect the future of the LGBTQ community. ABC NEWS: The movement to show up for the LGBTQ+ community, especially ahead of the presidential election. And so we're joined by Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson. Kelley, thanks for being here with us. I want to get right into some new research that the Human Rights Campaign has published that puts some hard numbers behind trends in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. Tell us what you're seeing in that data. ROBINSON: Look, the state of the LGBTQ+ community, it's strong and it's resilient. So last year we, for the first time in the organization's history, declared a national state of emergency for LGBTQ+ people. Now, I got to be clear that many people are experiencing a lot of harm. I talked to pediatricians who are receiving death threats. I talked to teachers and drag queens [who] are being met with AR-15s when they go to work. This is real and it's serious. But what I'm also seeing is that the tides are beginning to turn. This year, still we saw a record level of introduction of bad bills, but nearly none of them made it across the finish line. A state like Georgia wasn't able to pass a single bad bill attacking our community into law. That didn't happen by accident. That happened because we showed up. We showed up powerfully, and we made it clear that we weren't going to accept attacks on any members of our community, not now and not ever. ABC NEWS: With some of those pieces of legislation not making it cross the finish line, as you mentioned, what does that tell you for the future, in case other pieces of similar legislation are brought to the fold? ROBINSON: You know, it tells me that there's hope here. You know, as hard as the world is right now, I want folks, especially my community, to be clear that we are not without hope. And we are certainly not without power. These things aren't happening because we're weak. They're happening because we're strong. Look, across the country, we've identified 75 million voters that prioritize LGBTQ+ issues when deciding who to vote for. 75 million! That's equivalent to the number of people in every battleground state combined. This is huge. Our job is to make sure that those people know what's at stake, and have the tools and resources to turn out to the polls, because when we show up, when all of us show up, equality wins every single time.  ABC NEWS: In broad strokes, what should people know about what's in the legislation and some of the legislation across the country? What is at stake here? ROBINSON: Look, they're attacking every part of our community. I mean, I see bans on access to health care, drag bans, book bans, trying to make its way across the country, bathroom ban, something we haven't seen at this volume since, you know, the 2010s. But the other threat is really happening federally. We've got to be clear that when you look at the presidential election, this isn't just a race between two candidates. This is a race between two fundamentally versions of this country. Let's be clear. Donald Trump installed a conservative Supreme Court that not only overturned Roe v Wade, but said the quiet parts out loud. The next, the court should revisit is Obergefell and Lawrence cases that fundamentally protect our rights in this country. In this moment, we have to be clear that the progress of the last 40 years of progress, of last 50 years, it's fragile and it's all on the line. So this election could not be more important if you care about the LGBTQ+ community, if you're a member of our community, because this election is the election that will determine our futures. ABC NEWS: And, Kelley, you touched on it for a minute. I want to go back. You said that the Human Rights Campaign declared a national state of emergency last year for LGBTQ+ people in the United States. What impact did you want to make with a move like that? ROBINSON: We wanted to elevate the crisis. You know, so many bills are moving across the country. It's easy to believe that this is only happening in a state or two, or to feel isolated in your experience. But what we're actually seeing is a coordinated attack from our opposition. There are forces out there like the Alliance Defending Freedom, like the American Principles Project, who are saying the quiet parts out loud, that they are attacking our community because they're trying to use us as a political wedge. We cannot let that happen. We have to see them clearly for what they are and respond in kind. We have to build a movement that doesn't just protect our rights today, but advances equality moving forward. ABC NEWS: So with that said, how are you trying to reach voters on these issues, particularly voters who have not supported the gender expansive community, maybe, in the past? ROBINSON: Look, we're at a unique moment. There is so much opportunity in front of us. Look, right now, Generation Z, a third of them identify as members of the community, a third. What that means is, every single day there are 2,200 Americans who identify as LGBTQ that are turning 18 years old. That also means that there are more allies than ever before, as these folks feel empowered and safe to come out as a as fully who they are. So in this moment, we have to be clear that this is a time where we don't have to settle. We don't have to pretend that we are small. We have to embrace our power. And anyone that's feeling scared or feeling anxious right now. The antidote to that anger is taking action. There are things that you can do to talk to people in your community, to tell your story, to give resources to organizations like ours or candidates that you care about because it does make, make a difference and it will matter. ABC NEWS: Kelley Robinson, thank you so much for joining us. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Former President Donald Trump’s interview Monday with New York City probation officials lasted just under a half-hour, sources familiar with it told ABC News. Trump participated in the interview remotely from Mar-a-Lago. His defense attorney, Todd Blanche, was with him. Unlike most defendants, Trump was given permission to be accompanied by counsel. The sources described the interview as cordial and routine. Trump was not asked anything surprising. The New York City Probation Department will now prepare a report for Judge Juan Merchan ahead of Trump's July 11 sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The report is supposed to include, among other things, Trump’s description of his crime, whether he expressed remorse and any statements he wished to make about why he did it.  Last month, a jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election, including a $130,000 money payment to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with him, which he has denied. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

About 25 people were arrested Monday night as they attempted to set up a tent encampment on the University of California Los Angeles campus, university police said in a statement. ""The individuals are in the process of being cited, issued 14-day stay away orders from UCLA property, and released,"" the UCLA Police Department said. ""Approximately 150 protesters remain in the area as of the latest update."" The arrests follow a series of tense days in late April and early May on the school's campus, where pro-Palestinian protesters had created a sprawling encampment surrounded by plywood and metal barricades. Counter-protesters had clashed with the group on at least one occasion. Police from several departments descended on the earlier encampment on May 2, arresting dozens of protesters and dismantling the tents and barricades.  About 100 people marched on Monday afternoon through campus, entering at least one hall and disrupting a final exam, police said. The group, which was associated with a registered student organization, also set up ""unauthorized and unlawful"" encampments at several locations around campus. They used ""tents, canopies, and barricades with patio furniture,"" police said. University officials asked the group to leave two locations -- the Janss Steps and the Kerckhoff patio -- and the group complied, police said. The group had by early evening made their way to the courtyard between Dodd Hall and the School of Law, where they were seen assembling another tent encampment, police said. ""The group restricted access to the general public in violation of University policy and also disrupted nearby final exams,"" police said in a statement. About 25 people were arrested under a California law barring ""Willful Disruption of University Operations,"" police said. One additional person had been arrested for interfering with a police officer as the group set up their first encampment, police said. That person was cited and released, police said.

The State Department has launched a beta program for passport renewal applications that will be open to the public, according to senior officials at the department. According to the officials, the program will begin by accepting a small number of online applications each day, with that limited number gradually ramping up as time goes on to ensure the State Department ""can track any issues that arise and address them quickly and continuously improve the experience for the American people."" ""The goal of online passport renewal is to save Americans time and effort, making it more convenient to renew their U.S. passports,"" one senior State Department official said.  Eligible applicants must be 25 or older, live in the United states or one of its territories, currently hold a passport that is or was valid for a 10-year period, was issued between 2009 and 2015, and the biographic data on the document must be accurate and not require any changes to name, gender, date or place of birth. Applicants should also not have scheduled international travel for at least eight weeks from the point they submit the application and must be requesting routine -- not expedited -- service. The officials also noted that once the online application for renewal is submitted, the old passport will be cancelled, and they will be unable to use it to travel internationally. Officials didn't specify how long this beta program is expected to run, saying only that it will ""continue over the course of the coming months."" Initially, officials say processing times will be the same as wait times for regular, mail-in renewals, but they anticipate the overall wait will ""eventually"" be shorter because applicants won't have to mail in their documents. The State Department has previously conducted several rounds of testing for the digital system, processing 565,000 online applications to date.  The creation of an online passport renewal process was first announced in 2021 by President Joe Biden. The White House originally anticipated rolling out a finished product much earlier, by the end of 2022. One senior State Department official explained that the delay was because the administration wanted to ensure the experience of applying for a new passport online was the best it could be, but the department was also bogged down through 2022 and much of 2023 by a backlog of passport applications created by pandemic restrictions. As for regular passport processing times, the officials say they are still seeing a ""strong demand"" from the public, but that they should have ""no trouble"" meeting it and ""no significant delays in processing"" throughout the year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

House Republicans on Wednesday afternoon passed a resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur on his handling of classified documents. The final vote was 216 to 207. Rep. David Joyce of Ohio was the only Republican who voted against the contempt resolution. Speaker Mike Johnson called the outcome ""a significant step in maintaining the integrity of our oversight processes and responsibilities."" ""It is up to Congress – not the Executive Branch – to determine what materials it needs to conduct its own investigations, and there are consequences for refusing to comply with lawful Congressional subpoenas,"" Johnson said in a statement.  Garland, in response, said it was ""deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon."" ""Today's vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department's need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees,"" Garland said in a statement. ""I will always stand up for this Department, its employees, and its vital mission to defend our democracy."" While the Department of Justice has made a transcript of Hur's interview with Biden available to the GOP-led committees, House Republicans argue the audio tapes are necessary to their stalled impeachment investigation into the president. ""The Committees need the audio tapes to verify the accuracy of the written transcripts given this White House has been known to heavily edit the President's statements,"" Johnson said. ""This is a simple matter -- we have the transcript, and we need the audio."" The contempt resolution directs the House speaker to refer the case to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for possible criminal prosecution. Before the House Judiciary Committee last week, Garland continued to defend his decision to not turn over audio tapes of the interview, over which President Biden assert executive privilege. ""I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy,"" Garland said at the hearing.  Democrats have also come to Garland's defense, describing the GOP push to hold him in contempt a politically-motivated endeavor. ""This isn't really about a policy disagreement with the DOJ, this is about feeding the MAGA base after 18 months of investigations that have produced failure after failure,"" Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in testimony Tuesday before the House Rules Committee. Joyce, the sole Republican to vote against the resolution, also suggested it was a partisan act. ""As a former prosecutor, I cannot in good conscience support a resolution that would further politicize our judicial system to score political points,"" Joyce said. ""The American people expect Congress to work for them, solve policy problems, and prioritize good governance. Enough is enough.”  In the past, Congress has held Cabinet officials in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a House subpoena, including Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in 2019 and then-Attorney General Eric Holder in 2012. Congress held Peter Navarro, a former top trade adviser in the Trump administration, in contempt of Congress in 2022 for defying records and testimony to the now defunct House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Navarro was recently sentenced to four months behind bars. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally who was also held in contempt of Congress in 2022 for not complying with the Jan. 6 select committee, has been ordered to report to jail on July 1. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The Pentagon is downplaying Wednesday's arrival of four Russian Navy ships in Cuba as U.S. officials acknowledge that U.S. Navy ships ""actively monitored"" the Russian ships as they made their way to a port of call in Havana. On Thursday the U.S. military announced that a U.S. submarine had arrived at the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in an apparent show of U.S. force in the Caribbean region. At Wednesday's Pentagon press briefing, spokesperson Sabrina Singh downplayed the Russian naval flotilla's arrival in Havana noting that it's happened multiple times over the years but acknowledged that U.S. military assets had been tracking the ships on their way to Cuba. ""We've been tracking the Russians plans for this,"" Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary told reporters Wednesday.  The Russian ships' transit towards Cuba was monitored by six warships from the United States Navy, Canada, and France. They included the U.S. Navy destroyers USS Donald Cook, USS Delbert Black, USS Truxton, U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Stone, the Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec, and a French Lafayette class frigate. ""This is not a surprise we've seen them do this these type of port calls before and these are routine naval visits that we've seen under different administrations,"" Singh said. ""We're always constantly going to monitor any foreign vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters,"" she added. U.S. territorial waters stretch out 12 nautical miles from the coastline. A U.S. official said the Russian ships came 30 miles from the American coastline as they transited the Atlantic Ocean. On Thursday, U.S. Southern Command disclosed that a U.S. submarine had pulled into the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in an apparent show of U.S. force in the region though it was labeled as a ""routine port visit"". ""The fast-attack submarine USS Helena is in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as part of a routine port visit as it transits the U.S. Southern Command geographic area of responsibility while conducting its global maritime security and national defense mission,"" said a SOUTHCOM statement posted on X. ""The vessel's location and transit were previously planned."" Russia's Defense Ministry has been very open about the port of call in Havana being made by the frigate ""Admiral Gorshkov,"" the nuclear-powered submarine ""Kazan,"" the sea supply tanker ""Akademik Pashin"" and the ocean rescue tug ""Nikolai Chiker."" Cuba's defense ministry has described the visit as ""keeping with the historical friendly ties between Cuba and the Russian Federation and is fully consistent with international rules."" In a statement, the ministry said ""none of the ships carry nuclear weapons, due to which our country does not pose any threat to the region."" Even though the Russian ships are in port, Singh said the U.S. was ""going to continue to monitor what's happening in the region."" According to the Pentagon, Russia has sailed warships into the Western Hemisphere yearly from 2013 to 2020 with regular port visits into Havana. The most recent docking of a warship was in June 2023 though the most recent military exercise in the region was in 2008 with Venezuela. A U.S. official said that the port visit to Havana will last a few days and that sometime next week the Russian flotilla is expected to make a port of call in Venezuela. The Russian Navy ships will not be the only warships from a foreign military power making port in Havana this week. The Canadian patrol vessel HMCS Margaret Brooke will conduct a port visit to Havana from June 14 to 17, the first time that a Canadian warship has made a port of call there since 2016. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
29,Emily Shapiro,Parkland's 1200 building will be torn down this week. Two moms say it's overdue.,https://abcnews.go.com/US/parklands-1200-building-torn-week-grieving-moms-long/story?id=110780148,"This week, demolition will begin on the 1200 building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.",2024-06-12T19:23:18Z,"""It's done nothing in the last six years but bring horror,"" one mom said. For more than six years, the 1200 building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School sat untouched like a time capsule, with its classrooms still filled with dried blood and students' strewn papers. This week, the site of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting will be torn down -- a move two grieving moms say is long overdue. The demolition will start Friday, timed for immediately after the last day of school, which was on Monday, according to Broward County Public Schools. The demolition had been scheduled to begin Thursday but was delayed because of inclement weather. Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the Feb. 14, 2018, massacre. Victims' families were permitted to go inside the 1200 building for the first time last summer, following the conclusion of the trials of gunman Nikolas Cruz, who was sentenced to life in prison, and former school officer Scot Peterson, who was acquitted of child neglect after he had allegedly retreated while students were being shot. Victim Scott Beigel's mother, Linda Beigel Schulman, was adamant about going in the building -- and she said she was not prepared for what she saw. ""It was horrible,"" she told ABC News last year. ""All the glass being shot out ... seeing the bullet holes in the walls."" Beigel, a geography teacher and cross-country coach, was shot to death while ushering his students to safety in his third floor classroom. Inside Beigel's room, Schulman saw her son's notes and his open laptop, covered in dust. One year later, the images are just as vivid in her mind. ""I could draw Scott's room,"" Schulman told ABC News last week. ""I see Scott's desk, I see as you walk into Scott's room where he was when he was murdered."" As hard as it was to witness, Schulman said she's glad she did. ""I came out very different after the trial than I went in, and it took me awhile to process [the details the trial provided]. And going back into Scott's classroom was really the same,"" Schulman explained. ""I was definitely not the same when I came out of there."" ""It's just a body-shaking experience,"" she said. ""That's where he worked and that was his happy place -- and that's where Scott was murdered."" Patricia Oliver, whose fun, athletic 17-year-old son Joaquin was among those killed, never stepped foot in the 1200 building. She said it'd be too painful. ""Walking through the area where he was found, surrounded by blood, that I can't handle -- I really can't handle it,"" she told ABC News last week. Seeing ""every single piece of evidence [at Cruz's trial], to me, was more than enough,"" Oliver said. ""I need my well-being in the right place."" ""I know more than enough of what happened to him -- and his absence is absolutely painful every single day,"" she added. After the families' visits, politicians went to the 1200 building to see the bullet-ridden walls for themselves, including Vice President Kamala Harris and some members of Congress. ""It's important to see, unfortunately, what it looks like when a mass shooting comes to your high school,"" Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., who graduated from Stoneman Douglas, said at the time. ""Every backpack that was dropped, every shoe that fell off ... is exactly as it was on that very day."" Schulman supported the tours and said witnessing the inside of that building should've been mandatory for lawmakers to help open their eyes to the realities of gun violence. But, Oliver said, ""I wasn't comfortable seeing they were using the building as an exhibition."" ""This is not a circus,"" Oliver said. ""It is a crime scene."" ""Every parent reacts in a different way, and that doesn't mean it's good or bad,"" Oliver added. ""I think everyone is carrying this emptiness, that, you don't know how to handle it. It's not for me to judge anyone.""  Neither Oliver nor Schulman will go witness the demolition. But both mothers say it's overdue. Oliver drives by the school frequently and she said it'll bring her relief to not have the ""physical reminder."" Schulman lives in New York, but she said on each trip to Parkland, she feels nauseous passing by the building. ""I think it's a long time coming,"" Schulman said. ""We can never forget -- we just don't need that."" Demolition will likely take several weeks, and will involve dismantling the structure in pieces, starting with the top floor, the school district said. ""Survivors of the tragedy, families of victims, as well as teachers and staff had any items they desired returned to them,"" according to the district. District officials have not revealed any future plans for the site. Schulman said she hopes it'll be transformed into a place for students to have fun and laugh, like a baseball field. ""Something that brings joy. Because it's done nothing in the last six years but bring horror,"" Schulman said. Oliver said she'd like the space to be filled with whatever would bring comfort and peace to current students, like a garden or patio.  The district said in a statement last month, ""We understand this is a sensitive and difficult time for the families of those who were killed, those who were injured, and all of those who are forever impacted by the tragedy. ... We will continue to keep the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community informed and updated as we navigate this process together."" In the wake of their tragedies, both moms are finding ways to honor their sons' lives. Schulman and her husband started the Scott J. Beigel Memorial Fund, which sends at-risk kids touched by gun violence to camp. ""They can actually leave their cares behind -- they can just be kids,"" she said. Oliver and her husband have become advocates for gun control through their organization Change the Ref. Each summer, they ramp up their efforts with events honoring Joaquin's Aug. 4 birthday. This year, he would've turned 24. Joaquin was always looking ahead, his mom said. Now, ""he’s the one who pushes us,"" she said. ""We need to keep going, we need to keep fighting,"" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Deputy Inspector Paul Zangrilli, who led a police precinct in Manhattan, is accused of trying to cover up the 2022 wreck by acts including switching seats with his girlfriend after the wreck and then offering the cab driver money. Zangrilli pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyer, Eric Franz, didn't immediately respond to phone messages from The Associated Press but told some news outlets Zangrilli was a respected inspector who has been waiting two years to “ clear his good name.” Manhattan prosecutors said Zangrilli was out drinking with his girlfriend on a summer night when he let her drive his unmarked police vehicle. She crashed into a cab, then, with Zangrilli in the passenger seat, sped away from the scene, Manhattan prosecutors said. Instead of turning his girlfriend in, prosecutors said Zangrilli switched seats with her, then kept driving. When the cab driver caught up with them at a red light and flagged down another police officer, prosecutors said Zangrilli repeatedly offered $500 or $1,000 to the cab driver rather than exchange insurance information. Then, prosecutors said, Zangrilli called an NYPD captain and told a series of lies: that he had been driving alone and was on his way to work when the crash happened. Prosecutors allege that he soon signed into work at his own precinct and called the owner of the bar asking him to erase video footage that would capture the couple's three-hour drinking session. “This alleged behavior was incredibly dangerous, leading to injuries for one cab driver and putting the safety of many other drivers and pedestrians at risk. Furthermore, this NYPD Deputy Inspector, then a Commanding Officer, allegedly went to great lengths to cover up the incident to avoid responsibility,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. “We will continue to hold public servants accountable when they violate the public trust.” Zangrilli is charged with various felonies, including tampering with evidence, offering a false instrument for filing and falsifying business records. He's also charged with drinking while driving and misdemeanors related to misconduct and obstruction. Zangrilli's date was also charged with drunken driving and pleaded not guilty.  In 2023, Zangrilli earned around $200,000 in base pay and other compensation, according to New York City public salary records.  Zangrilli was suspended without pay, the NYPD said in a statement. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
31,"R.J. RICO Associated Press, JESSE BEDAYN Associated Press","Micro communities for the homeless sprout in US cities eager for small, quick and cheap solutions",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/micro-communities-homeless-sprout-us-cities-eager-small-111115844,"In downtown Atlanta, shipping containers have been transformed into an oasis for dozens of previously unsheltered people who now proudly call a former parking lot home",2024-06-14T05:57:49Z,"In downtown Atlanta, shipping containers have been transformed into an oasis for dozens of previously unsheltered people who now proudly call a former parking lot home ATLANTA -- In a dreary part of downtown Atlanta, shipping containers have been transformed into an oasis for dozens of previously unsheltered people who now proudly call a former parking lot home. The gated micro community known as “The Melody” doesn't look like a parking lot anymore. Artificial turf is spread across the asphalt. Potted plants and red Adirondack chairs abound. There's even a dog park. The shipping containers have been divided into 40 insulated studio apartments that include a single bed, HVAC unit, desk, microwave, small refrigerator, TV, sink and bathroom. On a recent afternoon, a half-dozen residents were chatting around a table in The Melody's smoking area. “I’m just so grateful,” said Cynthia Diamond, a 61-year-old former line cook who uses a wheelchair and used to be chronically homeless. ""I have my own door key. I ain't got to worry about nobody knocking on my door, telling me when to eat, sleep or do anything. I’m going to stay here as long as the Lord allows me to stay here.” Faced with years of rising homelessness rates and failed solutions, city officials across the U.S. have been embracing rapid housing options emphasizing three factors: small, quick and cheap. Officials believe micro communities, unlike shelters, offer stability that, when combined with wraparound services, can more effectively put residents on the path to secure housing.  Denver has opened three micro communities and converted another five hotels for people who used to be homeless. In Austin, Texas, there are three villages of “tiny homes."" In Los Angeles, a 232-unit complex features two three-floor buildings of stacked shipping containers.  “Housing is a ladder. You start with the very first rung. Folks that are literally sleeping on the ground aren't even on the first rung,” said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, sitting in one of the city's new micro communities that offer tiny, transitional homes for that first rung. More than 1,500 people have been moved indoors through the program, with over 80% still in the housing as of last month, according to city data. The inexpensive units are particularly a boon for cities with high housing costs, where moving that many people directly into apartments wouldn’t be financially feasible.  Both Atlanta’s and Denver’s program act as a stepping stone as they work to get people jobs and more permanent housing, with Denver aiming to move people out within six months. That includes Eric Martinez, 28, who has been in limbo between the street and the bottom rung for most of his life. At birth Martinez was flung into the revolving door of foster care, and he's wrestled with substance use while surfing couches and pitching tents. “It’s kind of demeaning, it makes me feel less of a person,” said Martinez, his eyes downcast. “I had to get out of it and look out for myself at that point: It’s fight or flight, and I flew.” Martinez’s Denver tent encampment was swept and he along with the others were directed into the micro communities of small cabin-like structures with a twin bed, desk and closet. The city built three such communities with nearly 160 units total in about six months, at roughly $25,000 per unit, said Johnston. The 1,000 converted hotel units cost about $100,000 each. On site at the micro community are bathrooms, showers, washing machines, small dog parks and kitchens, though the Salvation Army delivers meals. The program represents an about-face from policies that for years focused on short-term group shelters and the ceaseless shuffle of encampments from one city block to the next. That system made it difficult to keep people who were scattered through the city connected to services and on the path to permanent housing. Those services in Denver's and Atlanta's micro communities are largely centralized. They offer residents case management, counseling, mental health and substance abuse therapy, housing guidance and assistance obtaining anything from vocational skills training to a new pair of dentures. “We’re able to meet every level of the hierarchy of needs — from security and shelter, all the way up to self-actualization and the sense of community,” said Peter Cumiskey, the Atlanta site clinician. The Melody, and projects like it, are a “very promising, feasible and cost-effective way” to tackle homelessness, said Michael Rich, an Emory University political science professor who studies housing policy. Rich noted that transitional housing is still just the first step toward permanent housing.  The programs in Denver and Atlanta, taking inspiration from similar ones in cities like Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, offer a degree of privacy and security not found in congregate shelters or encampments. Giving each resident their own bathroom and kitchen is a crucial feature that helps set The Melody apart, said Cathryn Vassell, whose nonprofit, Partners For Home, oversees the micro community. Aside from a prohibition on overnight guests, staff emphasize the tenants are treated as independent residents. Vassell acknowledged it's unclear how long the containers will last — she's hoping 20 years. But, she said, they were the right choice for The Melody because they were relatively inexpensive and already had handicap-accessible bathrooms since many were used by Georgia hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The project, which took only about four months to complete, cost about $125,000 per unit — not “tremendously inexpensive,” Vassell said, but less than traditional construction, and much quicker. Staffing and security operations cost about $900,000 a year.  The Melody is the first part of Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens' target of supplying 500 units of rapid housing on city-owned land by December 2025. A 2023 “point-in-time” count found there were 738 unsheltered people in Atlanta, far fewer than many cities, but still an increase over the previous year. “We need more Melodies as fast as possible,” said Courtney English, the mayor's chief policy officer.  Few objected when The Melody was announced last year, but as city officials seek to expand the rapid-housing footprint, they know local pushback is likely. That's what Denver faced. Mayor Johnston said he attended at least 60 town halls in six months as Denver tried to identify locations for the new communities and faced pushback from local residents worried about trash and safety. “What they are worried about is their current experience of unsheltered homelessness,” Johnston said. “We had to get them to see not the world as it used to exist, but the world as it could exist, and now we have the proof points of what that could be."" The scars of life on the street still stick with Martinez. All his belongings are prepped for a move at a moment's notice, even though he feels secure in his tiny home alongside his cat, Appa.  The community has been “very uplifting and supporting,” he said, pausing. ""You don’t get that a lot.” On his wall is a calendar with a job orientation penciled in. The next step is working with staff to get a housing voucher for an apartment. “I’m always looking down on myself for some reason,” he said. But “I feel like I’ve been doing a pretty good job. Everyone is pretty proud of me.” ___  Bedayn reported from Denver. ____ Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

32,Devin Dwyer,Supreme Court invalidates Trump-era ban on bump stocks,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-invalidates-trump-era-ban-bump-stocks/story?id=110676062,"The Supreme Court on Friday invalidated a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, ruling the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives exceeded its authority.",2024-06-14T14:12:47Z,"It ruled the device does not convert a semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun. The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday invalidated a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, ruling the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrongly classified firearms equipped with a bump stock as machine guns. The 6-3 opinion was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court's three liberal justices, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. The court ruled a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a ""machinegun"" under federal law ""because it does not fire more than one shot 'by a single function of the trigger.'"" ""This case asks whether a bump stock -- an accessory for a semiautomatic rifle that allows the shooter to rapidly reengage the trigger (and therefore achieve a high rate of fire) -- converts the rifle into a 'machinegun.' We hold that it does not,"" Thomas wrote.  More than 700,000 bump stocks were sold since 2009 after the Obama-era ATF approved the manufacture and sale. The bump stock, which is non-mechanical, can simulate an automatic weapon, firing 400-800 rounds per minute. A fully automatic weapon, such as a M16 rifle, shoots 700-950 rounds per minute. The ATF ban on the accessory was created in the wake of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history when a gunman opened fire at Las Vegas music festival in 2017. Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds of others wounded. Sotomayor, in her dissent, noted the gunman in that tragedy used the device to create rapid fire. ""When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""A bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle fires 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.'"" Sotomayor added, ""Today's decision to reject that ordinary understanding will have deadly consequences. The majority's artificially narrow definition hamstrings the Government's efforts to keep machineguns from gunmen like the Las Vegas shooter."" Bump stock inventor Jeremiah Cottle, who previously spoke to ABC News about his controversial firearm accessory, called the court's decision a ""good ruling"" and personal ""vindication."" ""I think we have a violence problem in this country. I don't think we have a gun problem,"" Cottle said. ""I think it's a balance problem. And I think to blame it on an inanimate object is irresponsible."" Plaintiff Michael Cargill, a Texas gun store owner, told ABC News the case was ""not just about firearms"" but government overreach. ""They cannot walk into my house and tell me something that I owned, that I purchased, all of a sudden, years later, it's illegal and they decide to ban it,"" Cargill said. ""They can't do that."" Gun control advocates, on the other hand, decried the ruling. ""This decision by the high court is dangerous and wrong. The ATF must be undeterred in continuing to aggressively enforce our nation's gun laws,"" Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, said in a statement.  President Joe Biden, in the wake of the ruling, issued a statement calling on Congress to ban bump stocks as well as assault weapons. But given the narrow partisan divide on Capitol Hill, the influence of the gun lobby and election-year campaign politics -- immediate legislative action in response to the court's ruling is unlikely, even though a ban did have some bipartisan support in 2017. Trump's campaign said the court's decision ""should be respected"" and that the ""right to keep and bear arms has never been more critical."" The statement, however, did not address the fact that the ATF imposed the ban during his administration.

The Marion County Sheriff's Office released video of detectives questioning Susan Lorincz, the Florida woman charged in the fatal shooting of Ajike ""AJ"" Owens, a Black mother of four who lived across the street from Lorincz. The video, released on Monday, showed the moment Lorincz, who is white, was arrested after an almost two-hour long interrogation four days after the fatal incident. Following the shooting, Lorincz told detectives she was acting in self-defense when she shot Owens, who was with her 10-year-old son, through the closed door of Lorincz's home on June 2, 2023, according to the video. ""She was saying 'I'm going to kill you,'"" Lorincz told detectives about Owens during the interrogation. ""There was banging. There was yelling. I thought she was going to just break down the door,"" she said. ""My heart was pounding and I thought, 'she's really going to kill me.'"" According to detectives, no other witnesses heard Owens shouting threats during the dispute. ""No one that we've interviewed so far has made any statements about her saying that she wanted to kill you,"" one of the detectives told Lorincz. Lorincz was charged with first-degree manslaughter in Owens' death and a trial is expected to begin on August 12. She pleaded not guilty and remains in custody. On the night of the incident, Lorincz called 911 at 8:54 pm to report Owens' kids trespassing on her property in Ocala, Florida, according to records obtained by detectives. After approximately five minutes on the phone, the 911 dispatcher informed Lorincz that deputies were on their way. At 9:01 pm, less than two minutes after hanging up with 911 dispatchers, Lorincz called again to say she had shot Owens, according to police records. Police said Owens had gone to Lorincz's home to speak with her about the dispute involving Owens' children playing near her home.  Detectives later questioned Lorincz about her online search history, according to the video of the interrogation, asking her if she'd looked up self-defense laws in Florida. She told detectives she'd done so earlier that day after seeing an article on Facebook. ""I know what you're thinking. Did I look up the law so that I could do something? No,"" Lorincz told detectives in the video. During the interrogation, Lorincz told detectives she'd only communicated with Owens about two or three times since the mother of four moved across the street and repeatedly denied ever using racial slurs towards Owens and her children on the night of the shooting. Body camera footage released last July by the Marion County Sheriff's Office showed seven incidents between Feb. 25, 2022, and April 25, 2023, in which Lorincz called sheriff's deputies to complain about neighborhood children, including Owens' children, playing near her home. The body camera videos show a child alleging in comments to sheriff's deputies that Lorincz called the children in the neighborhood racial slurs and another who accused Lorincz of being ""racist."" Lorincz admitted to calling children in the neighborhood racial slurs and other derogatory terms in the past, according to a police report. ""I feel that there was a level of fear,"" one of the detectives told Lorincz about the night of the shooting. ""But from everything I've seen, it doesn't rise to the level for you to justify shooting through a closed door with a firearm, and I think you know that wasn't reasonable."" ""But there were times I called and deputies never showed up,"" Lorincz responded. The detective responded by saying, ""it was two minutes"" and she said, ""to me, it wasn't two minutes.""  ""I'm not taking away how you were treated,"" the detective told Lorincz. ""But those are children nonetheless, and now they don't have a mother to go home to and I think you know what you did was wrong and I think you know there were already deputies on the way."" Lorincz initially refused arrest after detectives brought in a Marion County deputy to transport her to jail, the video showed. After repeated attempts to persuade her to cooperate, she told detectives, ""I don't care. Kill me,"" the video shows. Before Lorincz was arrested, detectives gave her an opportunity to write a letter to Owens' children, according to the video. ""I am so sorry for your loss. I never meant to kill your mother. I was terrified your mom was going to kill me. I shot out of fear,"" Lorincz wrote, according to detectives in the video. Attorneys for Lorincz and Owens' family did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
34,Julia Jacobo,This distinct polar bear population could soon go extinct: Study,https://abcnews.go.com/International/prolonged-ice-free-periods-putting-hudson-bay-polar/story?id=111057322,"A unique population of polar bears is at risk of extinction should ice-free periods continue to get longer, researchers have determined.",2024-06-13T15:49:03Z,"Polar bears' primary prey, the ringed seal, are also at risk. A segment of the polar bear population is at risk of extinction should ice-free periods continue to get longer, researchers have determined using analysis of the sea ice as well as the health of the bears themselves. Ice-free periods in Canada's Hudson Bay have been lengthening over the past few decades, scientists say. Global warming is projected to extend the ice-free periods even more, reducing the ability for the region's resident polar bear population to hunt, putting them at risk of extinction if greenhouse gas emissions continue at projected levels, a study published in Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday found. The Hudson Bay is historically one of the few places in the Arctic where polar bears have routinely come ashore when all of the sea ice has melted, Geoff York, senior director of research and policy of Polar Bears International and co-author of the paper, told ABC News. What used to be an ice-free period of about four months has now extended far beyond, to the point that the polar bears in the southern and western Hudson Bay have been stretched to the point of genetic adaptation and the length of time they can fast, York said. Today's Hudson Bay polar bears are spending five weeks or longer on land than their grandparents did, York said.  Collar cameras strapped to Hudson Bay polar bears showed that the longer extents of ice-free periods are putting the Hudson Bay polar bears at risk of starvation, according to a paper published in Nature earlier this year. Polar bears that were forced to find food on land -- by foraging on berries and eating birds -- lost about the same amount of weight as the bears that simply fasted, proving that to these bears, food on land had nowhere near the same amount of nutrients as seals, which are full of fat and blubber, the researchers found. ""Their primary food sources require them to be out on the sea ice,"" Alex Crawford, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's Department of Environment and Geography and co-author of the paper, told ABC News. ""So that means that if they are spending [a] longer time on land in the summer, they are spending a longer amount of time effectively fasting.""  The early disappearance of sea ice, now in the late spring and early months, occurs at the same time that pups are being born and when mother bears put on most of their fat that will get them through the winter, York said. Putting them on shore early puts them in a precarious body condition for the upcoming cold months. ""Females are going to be less successful taking a pregnancy to term,"" York said. ""Even if they do carry it to term, they'll be less successful in raising those cubs in the first year."" Between 1.6 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-Industrial times is the range in which the Hudson Bay polar bears are expected to go extinct, Crawford said. ""That low end, we're knocking on the door of that already,"" Crawford said.  The paper brings together the latest climate models with two components that greatly affect polar bear survivability -- snow depth and ice thickness -- for the first time, York said. Ringed seals, polar bears' primary source of prey, need adequate snow depth to successfully den and protect their young in the springtime. Even when accounting for bias in the climate models, the paper's findings were still grim, Crawford said. Predictions made in the early ‘90s about warming impacts on polar bears are happening sooner than expected, York said.  Researchers have observed ""dramatic"" drops in the Hudson Bay subpopulation of up to 26% in the last decade, York said. There are only about half the number of polar bears in the population than 40 years ago. ""That decline is already kind of in progress, and if anything, I think now we'll see it likely accelerating,"" York said. There is a chance for the sea ice to recover drastically, Crawford said. If greenhouse gas emissions were to stop altogether, the extent of the sea ice could reverse in just a matter of years, Crawford said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In a setback to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, the Russian prosecutor's office announced Thursday he will stand trial on espionage charges, officially ending any future pre-detention appeals. ""The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation has approved an indictment in the criminal case against US citizen Evan Gershkovich,"" the office said in a statement. ""The criminal case has been sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court for consideration on the merits."" It continued, ""The investigation established and documented that the American journalist of The Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA in March 2023, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region about the activities of the defense enterprise JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod for the production and repair of military equipment.""  Gershkovich has denied he was involved in any espionage and the U.S. State Department has declared him to be wrongfully detained. The statement Thursday marks the first time prosecutors have publicly accused Gershkovich of working for the CIA, alleging without evidence that he was collecting ""secret information"" on a tank factory in the Sverdlovsk region. Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government and Gershkovich's many colleagues all vehemently dispute he was working as a spy and say that he was doing his job as a reporter. Gershkovich was on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg, the capital of the Sverdlovsk region, when he was arrested in March 2023. Previously, prosecutors have alleged Gershkovich was working for a foreign intelligence service without specifying which one. ""Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,"" Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal publisher, and Emma Tucker, Wall Street Journal editor in chief, said in a joint statement published in The Wall Street Journal. ""Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous."" They added, ""Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press.""  In March, Gershkovich's parents had told ABC News they were optimistic about progress in their son's case. ""We know that the U.S. government is taking Evan's case very seriously,"" his mother, Ella Milman, told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive sit-down interview. ""I think if you let the pessimism in ... the game is over,"" she said. ""And our saying in the family is we're moving forward. Moving forward."" Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first comments on Gershkovich's detention in months on June 5. ""I know that the United States administration is really taking energetic steps for his release. This is true. But such issues are not resolved through the media,"" Putin said. ""They love such a quiet, calm professional approach and dialogue between the intelligence services."" He added, ""You know, you believe that he is innocent, and Russian law enforcement agencies and special services believe that he committed illegal actions, which are called espionage. I will not go into details."" Gershkovich most recently appeared in court in Moscow for a pretrial hearing on April 23 as part of an appeal against the spying charges. His appeal was denied and he was ordered held through at least June 30.  The reporter smiled and gave a thumb's up when asked by ABC News inside the courtroom how he was doing. ""He has one more appeal that he can make, appealing his detention, but what's most likely going to happen before the 30th of June is Evan will be moved from Lefortovo, where he is currently held in prison, to instead Yekaterinburg, and when he gets out to Yekaterinburg, that's when the trial process most likely will start,"" U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Thursday during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Carstens continued: ""I will tell you, if it's anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there will be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won't have any contact with him. It'll almost be like it's gone dark."" The U.S. has been negotiating the release of both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan since not long after their detentions. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, was also accused of spying in 2018 and convicted in June 2020. Like Gershkovich, he has been declared wrongfully detained by the U.S. government. ""We're going to continue to try to pursue his release,"" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Thursday of Gershkovich. ""We put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said publicly, we're continuing to work to secure their release. It's one of the secretary's and the president's highest priorities."" ABC News' Shannon K.

After a congressional hearing on Wednesday on safety concerns over the V-22 Osprey, during which a military leader said the aircraft will remain under safety restrictions until 2025, grieving families of fallen service members voiced frustration over unanswered questions and demanded accountability in an interview with ABC News. Lawmakers on the House Oversight subcommittee on national security pressed Pentagon witnesses on the deadly history of the aircraft throughout the hearing. ""The total number of fatalities that I'm tracking is 54 fatalities ... and 93 injuries,"" said Vice Adm. Carl Chebi, head of U.S. Naval Air Systems Command, which oversees the Osprey for the entire U.S. military. After a string of fatal V-22 crashes between 2022 and 2023, Chebi decided to ground Osprey flights to give time for investigators to identify potential problems and come up with safety recommendations. The military lifted the flight ban in early 2024, after instituting several new protocols and restrictions. In June 2022, five Marines were killed after a clutch problem caused a failure in the right engine of their V-22 during a training flight over Glamis, California, a military investigation found. Some of the changes that came out of Chebi's safety stand-down were designed to address this problem, both by giving flight crews updated protocols on how to handle clutch problems and by preventatively replacing key parts before they could become too worn. But on Wednesday, Chebi said that the risk posed by the clutch problem will not be eliminated until a redesign is completed, which could take more than a year, and he will not lift the restrictions on Osprey flights until then. ""I will not certify the V-22 to return to unrestricted flight operations until I am satisfied that we have sufficiently addressed the issues that may affect the safety of the aircraft. Based on the data that I have today, I'm expecting that this will not occur before mid 2025,"" he said. Chebi said he has also ordered a comprehensive review of the Pentagon's Osprey program, which will take another six to nine months to be completed. Several family members of Marines killed in the 2022 tragedy traveled to attend Wednesday's hearing, and could be seen holding photos of their deceased loved ones in their seats directly behind the witnesses. ""The families submitted some questions that we had hoped to be answered,"" Amber Sax, wife of Capt. John Sax, told ABC News after the hearing. ""Not all of them were answered. I would say the majority actually were not, unfortunately."" Sax would also like answers from the companies that make the Osprey. And she's not alone. Last month, she and family members of the other Marines killed in the 2022 catastrophe filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing, Rolls Royce and Bell Textron, which are each involved in producing the aircraft. The companies have said they can't comment on pending litigation. ""We have many questions for them that we hope that they will answer and that will come to light,"" Sax said. ""And I believe that they're the people that should be sitting in those seats next time."" ""We don't want someone else to have to go through what we've been going through for the last two years now. Something has got to change. Something definitely has to change,"" said Michelle Strickland, mother of Lance Cpl. Evan Strickland, who was 19 when he was killed in the crash. Evan's father agreed. ""We stand together as families to hold accountable those that owe us answers,"" said Brett Strickland. ""We have to be their voice, because they no longer have one."" While the military has other aircraft that could possibly take on the missions currently carried out by the V-22, the Osprey stands out for its ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but also fly fast like a conventional airplane by changing the angle of its propellers. Timothy Loranger, an attorney at Wisner Baum representing the families, echoed lawmakers who advocated the military prioritize safety by using helicopters to replace Ospreys, until more problems have been worked out. ""They should, as they were asked, consider grounding the aircraft, using some alternative platform like the CH-53 [helicopter] or something else that they know is reliable,"" Loranger said.  The Gold Star families who spoke to ABC News after the hearing opened up about the strong character of their lost loved ones. ""He was kind, he was so genuine ... he had such a zest for life. Everything was like an adventure to him ... He was just so genuine and just a pure spirit,"" said Michelle Strickland of her son. His father spoke about with the lengths to which the young Marine would go to for his friends, from walking miles in the dark to be there for someone after a breakup, to ""just lightening the mood a little bit with this goofiness."" Amber Sax said of her late husband, ""John grew up with a love for flight. He loved his family very deeply. He loved his country very dearly."" The family members are not trying to get rid of the Osprey their loved ones flew; they just want it to fly at its best. ""A few short months before losing John, we celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary by getting an ultrasound to see our youngest daughter, who went on to arrive three months after his passing,"" Sax said in written testimony submitted to the House Oversight subcommittee ahead of Wednesday's hearing. Just after the hearing, she told ABC News, ""I want to be able to take my daughters to an air show someday -- John loved going to air shows, and he would have taken them if he were here -- and I want them to be able to see an Osprey flying and say 'That's flying because my daddy and other brave people made it safer for them to fly.'"" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
37,"Kelsey Walsh, Lalee Ibssa, Soo Rin Kim",Trump yet to clarify his abortion pill policy as SCOTUS rules on mifepristone,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-clarify-abortion-pill-policy-scotus-rules-mifepristone/story?id=111093705,"As the Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill mifepristone in an unanimous decision, Donald Trump has yet to disclose his own abortion pill policy.",2024-06-13T18:46:59Z,"Trump has said he'd soon release abortion pill policy details, but hasn't yet. Even as the U.S. Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill mifepristone in a unanimous decision on Thursday, former President Donald Trump has yet to disclose his own abortion pill policy. For months, Trump has teased that he'd release policy details pertaining to the issue soon, but that moment has yet to come. Trump has been vague when it comes to reproductive rights as he himself acknowledges the importance of not alienating voters with his position in order to win elections. However, his comments come in an election year as abortion and contraception access remain key issues for many voters headed into November's election.  Trump's campaign pushed back, saying that the former president has been ""very clear."" ""He supports the rights of states to make decisions on abortion, and supports exceptions for abortions in cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. When the unanimous decision came down Thursday morning, the former president was meeting with congressional Republicans, but sources said he did not mention the ruling directly. Instead, he spoke of the Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 -- a landmark decision that he takes credit for. ""We did that -- it was an incredible thing, an incredible achievement. We did that. And now the states have it, and the states are putting out what they want. It's the will of the people,"" Trump said previously of the court's vote to overrule Roe v. Wade. On the Supreme Court decision, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez said, “The Supreme Court has unanimously decided 9-0. The matter is settled."" Trump has said abortion restriction decisions should be up to the states and insisted he believes in three exceptions: rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. He has not said if he personally favors a certain number of weeks into pregnancy at which state-level bans should take effect, though he has publicly criticized a six-week ban in Florida and, more recently, talked privately about the idea of a national 16-week ban with exceptions, sources told ABC News in February. Earlier this week, Trump spoke at the Life & Liberty Forum hosted by the Danbury Institute, an organization that says it promotes Judeo-Christian values and opposes abortion -- where he did not mention abortion. Trump told the group he'd stand by their side and vaguely told the anti-abortion group they would make a ""comeback"" if he's reelected.  ""These are going to be your years because you're going to make a comeback like just about no other group,"" Trump said to the group. Last month, Trump faced backlash as he tried to walk back comments he made suggesting he's open to restricting contraceptives. ""Well, we're looking at that and we're going to have a policy on that very shortly,"" Trump said during an interview with Pittsburgh TV station KDKA-TV. ""And I think it's something you'll find interesting and it's another issue that's very interesting."" Again, in late April, during an interview with TIME, Trump said he would have a statement out in two weeks explaining his position on mifepristone; however, when pressed on when the delayed announcement would be revealed, campaign sources told ABC News it would happen soon.  President Joe Biden has been more clear on the issue. Biden has made abortion a key issue in what is expected to be a tight race, and Vice President Kamala Harris has capitalized on the issue on the campaign trail. Biden has blamed Trump for the spread of abortion bans since the end of Roe v. Wade, encouraging voters to support reproductive rights -- and him -- in November. ""[Trump is] wrong, the Supreme Court was wrong. It should be a constitutional right in the federal Constitution, a federal right, and it shouldn't matter where in America you live,"" Biden said in a speech in April. ""This isn't about states' rights, this is about women's rights."" Democratic National Committee press secretary Emilia Rowland emphasized the stakes of the election, specifically toward reproductive freedoms. She said in a statement that the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday ""does not change the fact that because of Trump, millions of women in states across the country cannot access the health care they need,"" Biden on Thursday reminded voters that the fight for women's reproductive freedom is not over. ""Today's decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues,"" Biden said in a statement. ""It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom."" Leavitt, with the Trump campaign, said ""Joe Biden does not have any good policy of his own, so his failing campaign peddles lies about President Trump's views in a dishonest attempt to fear voters into supporting him.""

Donald Trump made a rare appearance in Washington on Thursday to lay out his second-term agenda to Republican lawmakers as he continues to stress party unity in the wake of his historic felony conviction and a month from becoming the party's official nominee. The former president spent the day just blocks away from the U.S. Capitol to attend a slate of meetings with GOP allies. First, he huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club. The meeting was behind closed doors, but multiple sources told ABC News the former president praised House Speaker Mike Johnson as doing a ""good job."" Trump also criticized the Department of Justice as ""dirty bastards"" as he aired grievances about his legal challenges.  The meeting unfolded as the Supreme Court handed down a major decision preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Sources told ABC News Trump did not mention the decision directly, but did discuss his view that abortion access should be decided by the states. He also insisted he believed in three exceptions to abortion restrictions: rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Politically, Trump told Republicans they could have a 40-seat majority in the House if they weren't so ""afraid"" of the issue, according to sources. He also went after Democrats like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Rep. Liz Cheney, sources said. Both Pelosi and Cheney, despite being on opposite sides of the aisle, are staunch critics of the former president. Later on Thursday, Trump met with Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters. After the meeting, he touted party unity in on-camera remarks but took no questions from reporters. ""This is an outstanding group of people. I'm with them 1,000%, they're with me 1,000%. We agree just about on everything and if there isn't, we work it out,"" Trump said. In a show of force, Trump was joined by a large group of senators, including Sens. Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Marsha Blackburn, and many others. Sens. Tim Scott and J.D. Vance, two vice presidential hopefuls, were also there to support Trump. ""We want to see just success for our country,"" Trump said. ""And we don't have success right now."" Trump has stayed off the U.S. Capitol campus entirely since he left office shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. His return on Thursday prompted President Joe Biden and Democrats to highlight the riot. The Biden-Harris campaign released a new advertisement claiming Trump is trying to ""burn it all down"" with footage of the Capitol riot. The former president said while Democrats accuse Republicans of being ""a bad example of democracy,"" they're the ones who ""are getting away with murder."" The Senate Republican discussion marked the first time since 2020 that Minority Mitch McConnell and Trump met face-to-face. McConnell and Trump have a rocky relationship, heightened after McConnell recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the wake of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But McConnell, walking back to the U.S. Capitol building afterward, called it a ""positive meeting."" ""He and I got a chance to talk a little bit and shook hands a few times,"" McConnell said. ""He got a lot of standing ovations. It was an entirely positive meeting. Mitt Romney was there as well.""  Johnson has more openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November's election and a potential second Trump presidency. ""I think it's important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,"" Johnson said at a news conference on Wednesday. ""I believe he'll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy."" At that news conference, Johnson also told ABC News he supports a bill that would allow current or former presidents to move state charges against them into federal court -- a measure aimed at showing support for Trump after being found guilty in his hush money trial in a New York state court. ""I think that's an idea that makes sense. It makes sense to most Republicans, and I think almost everyone will be in favor of that."" After the Thursday morning meeting, Johnson said that Trump ""didn't bring up that specific piece of legislation."" ""He did talk about his concern about the lawfare that's been waged against him -- and we all know it -- and I made the point in my introduction that it's backfired fantastically,"" Johnson said. ""President Trump has become a symbol of pushing back against corruption, the deep state of the weaponization of judicial system and that's a very encouraging development. So, I think that he made the point every time they indicted him, his polls went up.""  However, not every Republican fully welcomed back Trump when he came to the nation's capital. Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who have been vocal Trump critics, blamed previous conflicts as a reason for why they couldn't attend the meeting with Trump. The two voted with Democrats to impeach Trump for his actions related to Jan. 6. As he was in Washington, Trump also participated in a moderated discussion at a quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group consisting of more than 200 CEOs. Business Roundtable spokesman Michael Steel said the group invited both presumptive presidential nominees, but with Biden overseas to attend the G7 summit, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients joined the meeting in his absence. Some of the country's top executives attended the meeting, including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro and Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier, according to the executives' representatives or ABC News' observations outside the roundtable building. According to a spokesperson for the Business Roundtable, roughly 100 executives out of more than 200 members of the roundtable attended the meeting, which the spokesperson said was normal for their quarterly meetings like this. During his meeting with business leaders, Trump talked about tax cuts for corporations, as well as not taxing tip wages, according to people familiar with the meeting. Overall, those familiar with the meeting with Trump described it as ""business-like"" and that ""there wasn't a lot new from him today.""

The investigation into the ill-fated Titan submersible's dive to the location of the Titanic will now take longer than expected, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. ""The investigation into the implosion of the Titan submersible is a complex and ongoing effort,"" Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation Chair Jason Neubauer said in a statement Friday. ""We are working closely with our domestic and international partners to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the incident.""  The initial timeline for the investigation called for a report to be released within a year. Five people were killed when the OceanGate submersible imploded in June 2023, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The Coast Guard gave two reasons for the delay, including ""the need to contract two salvage missions to secure vital evidence and the extensive forensic testing required."" ""We're grateful for the international and interagency cooperation which has been vital in recovering, preserving and forensically testing evidence from a remote offshore region and extreme depth,"" Neubauer added in the statement. ""The MBI is committed to ensuring that we fully understand the factors that led to this tragedy in order to prevent similar occurrences in the future.""  The Coast Guard also sent best wishes to the families of the victims ahead of the anniversary of the implosion on June 19. In addition to Rush, those killed on the vessel included: Titanic researcher Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British businessman Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman. OceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations after the deadly implosion. While the investigation into what caused the fatal incident continues, outside experts previously called the carbon fiber construction of the Titan fundamentally flawed and a whistleblower who worked on a predecessor to the Titan vessel raised concerns about the inefficiency of the hull design. Rush had previously defended the decision to manufacture the submersible with carbon fiber, saying he believed it would have a better strength-to-buoyancy ratio than titanium.

40,Justin Gomez,Trump campaign seizes on misleading video to criticize Biden mental state: Fact check,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-seizes-misleading-video-biden-g7-criticize/story?id=111133423,"As Donald Trump turns 78, his campaign is trying to paint 2024 rival President Joe Biden as mentally incompetent by distorting a moment from the G7 summit.",2024-06-14T19:44:16Z,"The edited New York Post clip said Biden appeared to ""wander off"" at G7 summit. As Donald Trump turns 78 on Friday, his campaign is trying to paint 2024 rival President Joe Biden as mentally incompetent by distorting a moment from Biden's trip overseas this week to the G7 summit that has gone viral on social media. ""From Italy to the United Kingdom to New York, millions of people around the world woke up to headlines about Crooked Joe Biden's cognitive decline on full display at the G7 Summit,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. Leavitt was referring to a skydiving demonstration Biden attended on Thursday alongside other world leaders gathered in Italy. Footage from the event was selectively edited in a misleading way by the New York Post.  The Post made it seem as if Biden was speaking to no one before the Italian prime minister ushered him back to the group. In a caption, the New York Post wrote that Biden appeared to ""wander off"" and someone needed to ""pull him back to focus."" ""Biden was seen staring off into the distance and wandering around like a brain-dead zombie, and even had to be ushered by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni,"" Leavitt claimed. The edited video posted by the tabloid to X had 4.7 million views as of Friday afternoon. It was flagged by the social media platform, which provided additional context that the video had been cropped. The unedited footage shows a different picture: a skydiver had just landed in the spot Biden walked toward moments before and the president went to approach him to give him a thumbs up. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni then brought Biden back to the group so one of the skydivers could brief them. Another angle of the moment shows the skydiver Biden was addressing when he walked away. White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, in a post to X, said the ""Murdoch outlets are so desperate to distract from"" Biden's record that ""they just lie."" ""Here, they use an artificially narrow frame to hide from viewers that he just saw a skydiving demonstration,"" Bates wrote. ""He's saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs-up."" Bates also posted his own video that showed Biden walking toward the skydiver to praise him.  Polls show age is a major issue among voters this election cycle when it came to both candidates, though more appear to have concerns about Biden, who turned 81 last year. A recent Marquette University poll found 79% of respondents said the phrase ""too old"" describes Biden ""very or somewhat well,"" compared to 54% who said the same about Trump.

43,"ELÉONORE HUGHES Associated Press, GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA Associated Press",Outraged Brazilian women stage protests against bill to equate late abortions with homicide,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/outraged-brazilian-women-stage-protests-bill-equate-late-111158149,Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital.,2024-06-15T22:14:17Z,"Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the capital. SAO PAULO -- Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Sao Paulo on Saturday as protests sweep across Brazil in opposition to a bill that would further criminalize abortions. If passed, the law would equate the termination of a pregnancy after 22 weeks with homicide. The bill, proposed by conservative lawmakers and heading for a vote in the lower house, would also apply in cases of rape. Critics say those who seek an abortion so late are mostly child rape victims, as their pregnancies tend to be detected later. To rally opposition, rights’ groups created the ‘A child is not a mother’ campaign that has flooded social media. Placards, stickers and banners emblazoned with the slogan have abounded during demonstrations. And viral visuals depicting women in red cloaks compare Brazil to Gilead, the theocratic patriarchy Margaret Atwood created in her dystopian novel, “The Handmaid’s Tale.” About 10,000 people, mostly women, filled several blocks of Sao Paulo’s main boulevard on Saturday afternoon, organizers estimated. It was the biggest demonstration yet, following events in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, Florianopolis, Recife, Manaus, and other cities. Many wore green clothes and scarves, a common sight in women’s rights mobilizations across Latin America.  Marli Gavioli, 65, has mostly refrained from protesting since demonstrations in the 1980s that called for the end of the military dictatorship, but she told The Associated Press she's too outraged to remain home. “I couldn’t stay out of this, or I would regret it too much. We are being whipped from all sides, us women. It’s past time we do something,” she said. Brazil only permits abortion in cases of rape if there is an evident risk to the mother’s life or if the fetus has no functioning brain. Aside from those exceptions, Brazil’s penal code imposes between one and three years jail time for women who end a pregnancy. Some Brazilian women fly abroad in order to obtain abortions.  If the bill becomes law, the sentence would rise to between six and 20 years when an abortion is performed after 22 weeks. Critics have highlighted that would mean convicted rapists could receive lesser sentences than their victims. Experts say that late access to abortion reflects inequalities in health care. Children, poor women, Black women and those living in rural areas are particularly at risk. “We cannot be sentenced to prison for having suffered a rape and not receiving support and care,” Talita Rodrigues, a member of rights’ group National Front against the Criminalization of Women and for the Legalization of Abortion, said by phone. Of the 74,930 people who were victims of rape in Brazil in 2022, 61.4% were under 14 years old, according to a 2023 study of the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety, an independent group that tracks crimes. “For children, it is common for a pregnancy to be discovered only after 22 weeks,” Ivanilda Figueiredo, a professor of law at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said by phone. For example, they might not know that periods — a sign women aren't pregnant — are monthly, she said. Among the protesters in downtown Rio on Thursday was Graziela Souza, a 25-year-old student who was sexually assaulted as a child. “I think it’s very important for victims to be present, as much as it hurts,"" Souza said. ""We must speak out and fight against it, because if we stay at home we are going to lose.” Defenders of the bill have argued that abortions at a later stage were unimaginable when Brazil’s penal code was adopted in 1940, which explains why there is currently no time limit. Had it been envisioned, they argue, it would be considered infanticide. The bill’s author, lawmaker and Evangelical pastor Sóstenes Cavalcante, declined an interview request from the AP. On Wednesday, the lower house Speaker Arthur Lira rushed through a procedure to fast-track the bill in under 30 seconds, with many lawmakers reportedly unaware it was taking place. The maneuver allows the plenary to vote without the bill first clearing committees. Lira has been a top target for protesters' ire. Signs on Saturday read “What if it happened to your daughter, Lira?” and simply “Lira out.” Conservative lawmakers proposing the bill — who protesters have dubbed ‘the rape caucus’ — are playing politics, hoping to boost turnout and support from Evangelical voters in October municipal elections, Fernanda Barros dos Santos, a political scientist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said by phone. Abortion is a topic of high concern for Christians, who make up a majority of voters in Brazil. “The bill puts people who are progressive in a very difficult situation, because they lose votes by defending abortion rights,” said Figueiredo, the law professor. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government has been seeking inroads with Evangelicals, a key voting bloc for far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro. Lula beat Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential election. “The president sent a letter to Evangelicals in the campaign saying he was against abortion. We want to see if he will veto it. Let’s test Lula,” Cavalcante, the bill's author, told local news outlet G1 on Tuesday.  First lady Rosângela da Silva, known as Janja, slammed the proposal on social media Friday, saying women and girls who are raped need to be protected, not revictimized. Lula finally weighed in on Saturday, speaking at the G7 in Italy. ""I had five kids, eight grandchildren and a great-grandchild. I'm against abortion. However, since abortion is a reality, we need to treat abortion as a public health issue,"" he said in a news conference. “And I think it's insanity that someone wants to punish a woman with a sentence that's longer than the criminal who committed the rape."" Although strict abortion laws have long been the norm across the predominantly Roman Catholic region of Latin America, feminist movements have gained momentum in recent years and delivered successive victories for abortion-rights campaigners. Colombia’s Supreme Court decriminalized abortion in 2022, following a similar breakthrough ruling by Mexico. Argentina’s Congress legalized abortion in 2020, and a few years earlier Chile rolled back a strict ban. In the U.S., the Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously preserved access to a medication that was used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the country last year, in the court’s first abortion decision since conservative justices overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Last September, Brazil’s top court opened a session on decriminalization of abortion. Former Chief Justice Rosa Weber, now retired, voted in favor. Chief Justice Luís Roberto Barroso — who also supports decriminalization — asked for an adjournment and the vote can be resumed at his behest. “We are behind on this issue, and we need to fight for progress,” Eduarda Isnoldo, a 27-year-old English teacher, said through tears at the Sao Paulo protest. “When you realize that your rights can be taken away so easily, it’s impossible to stay quiet.”  ___ Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
44,DEE-ANN DURBIN AND TATIANA POLLASTRI AP business writer,High orange juice prices may be on the table for a while due to disease and extreme weather,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/high-orange-juice-prices-table-due-disease-extreme-111128027,Orange juice prices have always been volatile and highly dependent on the weather,2024-06-14T15:40:59Z,"Orange juice prices have always been volatile and highly dependent on the weather MOGI GUACU, Brazil -- Orange juice prices have always been volatile, falling when bumper harvests create an oversupply of oranges and rising when frost or a hurricane knocks out fruit trees. But the record-high prices the world is seeing for OJ right now may be on the table for a while, since the diseases and extreme weather ravaging orange groves in some top-producing countries aren’t easily resolved problems. This year’s harvest in Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of orange juice, is likely to be the worst in 36 years due to flooding and drought, according to a forecast by Fundecitrus, a citrus growers’ organization in Sao Paulo state. “The concern isn't just that the price of juice is going up. The concern is not having the juice,” Oscar Simonetti, an orange farmer in Mogi Guacu, Brazil, said. In the U.S., Florida's already diminished orange production fell 62% in the 2022-2023 season after Hurricane Ian further battered a crop that was struggling due to an invasive pest. Drought also cut Spain’s orange production last year. Scarce supplies have sent prices soaring. In the U.S., a 12-ounce can of frozen orange juice concentrate cost an average of $4.27 in April, 42% more than during the same month a year earlier, according to government figures.  In the United Kingdom, where the British Fruit Juice Association says supplies are at 50-year lows, the price of fresh orange juice rose 25% over the past year, according to consumer research company Nielsen. Those price increases are turning off inflation-weary consumers. Orange juice consumption has fallen 15% to 25% in major global markets — including the U.S. and the European Union — over the last year, according to Rabobank, a Dutch bank that focuses on food and agriculture. Jonna Parker, a principal for fresh food client insights at market research company Circana, said consumers are increasingly getting their morning fruit intake from energy drinks, smoothies and other beverages besides orange juice. “The price gets high and people consider other alternatives,” she said. Global orange juice consumption was already declining before the current price hikes due to competition from other drinks and public concern about the amount of sugar in fruit juices. If that trend continues, it should help balance supply with demand and keep prices from rising much further, Rabobank said. But it expects limited supplies will keep prices elevated for some time. In some markets, orange juice is disappearing from shelves altogether. Late last year, McDonald’s in Australia removed orange juice from its menu in favor of an “orange fruit drink” that contains 35% orange juice. The company cited short supplies.  Tokyo-based Morinaga Milk Industry Co. expects to stop shipping its Sunkist brand orange juice – which uses juice from Brazil – by the end of June because of low juice supplies from Brazil, a company spokeswoman said. In April 2023, Megmilk Snow Brand Co., based in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, stopped shipments of 1-liter (about a quart) and 450-milliliter (15.2-ounce) packs of orange juice, which it sells under an agreement with Dole. Sales haven’t yet resumed. Some companies are considering using alternatives to oranges in their products. Coldpress, a British juice company, introduced a mandarin juice product in February, citing the high price of regular juicing oranges.  But others are tight-lipped about their plans. Several major orange juice makers – including Dole, Tropicana, Florida’s Natural, Uncle Matt’s and Coca-Cola, which makes the Simply and Minute Maid brands – declined to comment or failed to respond to inquires from The Associated Press. The roots of the current supply troubles stretch back decades. In 2005, an invasive bug called the Asian citrus psyllid arrived in Florida, injecting bacteria from its saliva into the state’s orange trees. The bacteria slowly kills the tree by destroying its root systems. There’s no known cure once a tree is infected. The impact has been devastating. In 2004, before the disease – called citrus greening – hit Florida, the state produced 200 million boxes of oranges. This year, it will produce less than 20 million. Michael Rogers, a professor of entomology and the director of the University of Florida’s Citrus Research and Education Center, said no type of orange tree is totally resistant to greening, but scientists have been trying to breed trees that are more tolerant of it. Citrus greening arrived in Brazil around the same time as Florida, but it has progressed more slowly there because Brazil has much larger orange groves. Bugs spread the disease by flying from tree to tree, Rogers said. Still, the disease is spreading. Fundecitrus estimates that 38% of Brazil’s orange trees had citrus greening in 2023. Simonetti, the orange farmer, estimates that 20% of his production is affected by greening. Oranges on affected trees don't ripen properly and fall off early, affecting the quality of their juice, he said. Shifting production to other locations isn’t necessarily an option. California grows oranges, for example, and the citrus psyllid doesn’t fare as well in the state’s climate. But California also doesn’t get the rainfall needed for juicing oranges; its oranges are usually sold for eating, Rogers said. Another issue impacting orange harvests is extreme weather, which is becoming more common as the world warms due to climate change. Last year, nine heat waves swept across Brazil, resulting in lower output and poorer fruit quality. This year, the impacts of El Niño have been particularly dramatic, with a historic drought in the Amazon and devastating floods in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. “The temperatures are high during the day. At night the temperature drops. The plant can't stand this temperature difference,” Simonetti said.  Brazil’s 2024-2025 harvest is expected to yield 232 million boxes of oranges, down 24% from the prior year. “We have never seen a harvest like this,” Vinícius Trombin, the coordinator of Fundecitrus’ crop estimates survey, said. To make up for the anticipated smaller yield, some producers are considering blending oranges with tangerines to make juice, Trombin said. But he’s skeptical. “The consumer wants an orange juice made up 100% out of oranges,” he said. Parker, of Circana, isn’t so sure. She thinks blends with other fruits might help hold down costs and revive consumer interest in orange juice. “The idea of multiple flavors is very popular and is a way to stand out,” she said. “You’ve got to keep people engaged. Once you lose that interest, it’s really hard to get people back.” ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.

The pontiff welcomed more than 100 comedians from 15 nations, including U.S. celebrities Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Rock, Stephen Colbert and Conan O’Brien. “In the midst of so much gloomy news, immersed as we are in many social and even personal emergencies, you have the power to spread peace and smiles,” Francis told the comedians. “You unite people, because laughter is contagious,” he continued, asking jokingly, “Please pray for me: for, not against!” Francis pointed out that in the creation, “Divine wisdom practiced your art for the benefit of none other than God himself, the first spectator in history,” with God delighting in the works that he had made. “Remember this,” he added. ""When you manage to bring intelligent smiles to the lips of even a single spectator, you also make God smile.” Francis also said it was OK to “laugh at God” in the same way “we play and joke with the people we love.” After delivering his speech, Francis greeted all the comedians individually, sharing laughs and jokes with some of them. “It was great, it was very fast and really loving, and made me happy,” Goldberg said afterward. O’Brien noted that the pope “spoke in Italian, so I’m not quite sure what was said.” “To be in that room and to be with all my fellow comedians, some of whom I’ve been good friends with for many years, in that environment, was quite strange,"" the TV host added. ""All of us were thinking, how did this happen? Why are we here, and when are they going to throw us out?” Colbert admitted his Italian “is really bad, I would like to speak it better.” But he managed to remind the pope that he had done the audiobook for his memoir. “It was wonderful, he’ll never forget me,” he joked. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Biden was walking Commander in the Kennedy Garden on Sept. 12, 2023, when the dog bit a Secret Service agent who approached the president to help him with something, the records obtained by conservative activist group Judicial Watch and reviewed by ABC News show. ""As I started to walk toward him to see if he needed help, Commander ran through his legs and bit my left arm through the front of my jacket. I pulled my arm away and yelled no,"" according to an email sent from an unnamed agent. ""When turning to close the door, Commander jumped again and bit my left arm for the second time."" The emails were part of Judicial Watch's lawsuit for U.S. Secret Service emails via a Freedom of Information Act. The email shows that while no skin was broken, the agent's coat did have dog bites in it.  After it was reported in the press that another agent was bit, frustration set in at least for one agent, the emails show. ""Can we please find a way to get this dog muzzled,"" the unnamed agent wrote. The dog was moved from the White House in October, due to a string of over 11 biting incidents, according to an ABC News tally.

In Israel, right-wing settlers question the delivery of aid to Gazans, while Israeli peace activists advocate for the passage of aid trucks. A Palestinian truck driver is back on the road delivering flour, sugar and salt to Gaza after being attacked by right-wing Israeli settlers last month. Tamer Muhtaseb and his partners were attempting to deliver much-needed goods at the Tarqumiya checkpoint between the West Bank and Israel, when he was assaulted, according to Muhtaseb, by Israeli settlers who he says sabotaged his truck by throwing bags of flour onto the road. ""They forced us to get out of the car, they started to throw the aids, if I got close to the car, they would hit me,"" Muhtaseb said. ""If you say any word they beat you; they handcuffed me."" The Israel Defense Forces has told ABC News that they condemn attacks on truck drivers. Before aid reaches Gaza, it changes hands multiple times. Muhtaseb and the other Palestinian drivers line up their vehicles at the last checkpoint in the West Bank before transferring their goods onto Israeli trucks for transportation through Israel. The trucks are supposed to reach one of the five gate crossings from Israel to Gaza, but even then they face more protests. ABC News got a chance to speak with a woman settler at the Tarqumiya checkpoint who said she is trying to block the aid from going to the hands of Hamas. ""The people who receive this food, they raped and murdered our children, and we should not give them food,"" the unidentified woman said. ""This money today finances Hamas in Gaza.""  She also said, ""It's not hate, and the settlers don't hate them. Rather, it's the opposite. The settlers want to live in peace."" Many Israelis believe that some of the aid Gazans receive is stolen by Hamas, something aid groups deny. Since the start of the war, the issue of aid has been deeply divisive and highly politicized. Aid groups say that Israel could be doing far more to ensure that desperately needed aid is reaching Gaza. Israeli peace activist Alon Lee Green is advocating for the passage of aid. ""We've been witness to so many escalating attacks here,"" Green said. ""We've seen those right-wing attacking the trucks. They even set trucks on fire. Sent two Palestinian drivers to the hospital. It's a fight over the soul of our own society."" UN agencies are sounding the alarm over high starvation levels, especially in the northern part of the strip. The UN World Food Program has paused its distribution of humanitarian aid from an American-built pier off Gaza due to safety concerns following one of the deadliest days of the war. It's the latest setback for the $300 million pier, which had only just returned to operation after being damaged by rough seas. However, Israel insists that enough aid is being authorized for delivery and that aid groups are the ones creating logistical challenges that result in a bottleneck. ""I've been working in Palestine for five years,"" Andrea de Domenico, head of the UN Humanitarian Office, said. “And I've gone through three wars in Gaza and constant problems and situations in the West Bank. And I learned that everything is politicized in this place. I'm pretty much convinced that there is an intent to set us up for failure."" Some aid groups argue that land routes are the most efficient way to deliver aid. Although settler disruptions may not significantly impact aid delivery to Gaza, peace activists like Green patrol the area to ensure that aid faces one less hurdle on its journey to the people of Gaza. Green was asked if it feels like they are screaming into a void. ""In the first weeks and months of the war, because we felt very isolated and very alone and attacked from every direction,"" Green said. ""But more and more forces are joining us in the call for a ceasefire, in the call for humanizing all the people that live here."" ""People that have been killed in Gaza are not bringing us more safety,"" Green said. ""And seeing people starving in Gaza is just something that will create more violence that not only Palestinians will pay the price of, but also Israelis will be hurt. I mean, we are bound to somehow live on this land together."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that mediators will keep working to finalize a ceasefire deal after Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan. Some proposed changes were considered ""workable,"" while others were not. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Esteemed economist Peter Goodman's book, ""How the World Ran Out of Everything,"" offers a comprehensive analysis of how the pandemic disrupted the global supply chain and its profound impact on daily life. Goodman starkly points out that shipping prices are skyrocketing, reaching levels comparable to the pandemic era when container shortages were rampant. In his book, Goodman uncovers a disturbing pattern. He asserts that for an extended period, major corporations have manipulated their markets by restricting product supply, resulting in inflated prices and societal disparities. He mentioned that meatpackers at slaughterhouses are now exporting more meat than ever. According to Goodman, we are essentially sacrificing the lives of slaughterhouse workers for the profit margins of monopoly companies. ABC News sat down with Goodman to discuss more about his book and inflation in the U.S. ABC NEWS LIVE : The global economics correspondent for The New York Times, renowned for his in-depth reporting in his new book, ""How the World Ran Out of Everything,"" Peter Goodman is taking a deeper look at how the global supply chain was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and how it could still be impacting your daily life. Peter Goodman, thank you so much for joining us.  GOODMAN: Thanks for having me. ABC NEWS LIVE: Talk a little bit about what inspired you to write this book. We all remember those days where people didn't even know what the supply chain was. And then very quickly, we learned about the supply chain during COVID.  GOODMAN: Yeah, I mean, it was cosmically bewildering, right? We're already dealing with quarantine kids, cooped up with distance learning. And suddenly, I mean, in my own case, I'm living in London with a newborn born in April 2020, and we're dealing with the fact that we can't find hand sanitizer. We can't find the ingredients to make hand sanitizer. We're hearing frontline medical workers are treating COVID patients without any protective gear. And you just wondered, like, what's going on here? ABC NEWS LIVE: It's just it was a scary time for a lot of folks to realize how dependent we are on the supply chain. GOODMAN: I mean, we are dependent upon this kind of rickety, improvised series of networks heavily focused on China. One thing is missing, and suddenly there's serious shortages. And we're still there for many products. And we're back in a shipping crisis, because the Hutus are opening fire on container ships heading toward the Red Sea. So we're again seeing shipping prices going up. And this is at the center of our inflation problems as well. ABC NEWS LIVE: Well, in your book, you allege that for decades, some of the largest businesses had amassed chokeholds on their markets while limiting the supply of their products as a way to charge higher prices. Talk about that allegation a little bit.  GOODMAN: So monopoly power is at the center of this, right? We all like to think about supply and demand. If demand is constrained, well then we understand that the price is supposed to drop. If there are shortages, then eventually production kicks in and makes more stuff and prices kind of equalize. But we have so many markets. like I focus on the beef industry, where the robber barons would blush, you know, four companies control 85% of the capacity for meatpacking in the United States. So even while ranchers were going out of business because they can't find people to buy their cattle in the midst of the pandemic, and we've got slaughterhouse workers, I profile a woman who actually lost her life at a slaughterhouse in Greeley, Colorado. When we decide, you know, we got to keep these plants going and the public is told, if not, you know, we're going to run out of meat. Well, these meatpackers are actually exporting more meat than ever in this time. So we essentially are sacrificing the lives of slaughterhouse workers for profit margins for monopoly companies. When things are scarce, price goes up. We know that. And there's a lot of engineered scarcity in this economy. ABC NEWS LIVE: Is that still the case as much today as it was two or three years ago during the pandemic? We've heard a lot more about this issue of the robber baron and this corporate greed and companies having this market power, but has anything been done to change that?  GOODMAN: I mean, the unfunny punchline in my book is every chapter, whether we're looking at rail, trucking, shipping, which is essentially this large, unregulated international cartel where, you know, during the worst of the pandemic, we saw shortages of containers. We saw the cost of moving factory goods from Asia to the West Coast of the United States, which is the gateway for most of our imports go up tenfold. Well, we're there right now. We're seeing shipping prices soar back close to those levels. This is not a history book. This is a book about the present and the future. ABC NEWS LIVE: That's concerning when we do have this already persistent inflation, those higher costs that people are still struggling with even as it's gotten better.  GOODMAN: Well that's right. I mean, the inflation rate has cooled quite a bit, but the prices haven't come down for all sorts of things. That's not news for anybody who's gone to the store to buy milk, eggs for their family, put gas in their car. I mean, we've got scarcity. A lot of it's engineered, some of it's disruption from the supply chain. But if we don't figure out how to make this system work, not just for the investor class, but for society as a whole and also for working people, you know, we're dependent upon this army of working people who most of us don't give a thought to. ABC NEWS LIVE: A sobering reminder as we forget when it's not quite in front of us as it was a couple years ago, but still a problem there, as you point out. Peter, thanks so much for being here.  GOODMAN: Thanks so much for having me.

Portland Fire and Rescue said on the social platform X that firefighters worked with engineers at Oaks Park to manually lower the ride, but crews had been preparing to conduct a high-angle ropes rescue if necessary. All riders were being evacuated and medically evaluated, and there were no reports of injuries.  One rider with a pre-existing medical condition was taken to a hospital for further evaluation as a precaution, Oaks Amusement Park said in a statement posted on social media. Medics released all other passengers. The ride, called AtmosFEAR, operates like a pendulum, with the capacity to swing riders completely upside down. Chris Ryan and his wife, from nearby Gresham, were at the park for his birthday. He told The Associated Press in a Facebook message that they had just been planning to ride AtmosFEAR when they saw it was stuck and heard people saying, “Oh my God, they are upside down.” They decided to walk away because of ""how scary the situation was,” he said. They eventually got on the Ferris wheel and heard a loudspeaker announcement that the park was closed and that people should evacuate.  When the ride stopped, park staff immediately called 911 and emergency responders arrived about 25 minutes later, the park statement said. Park maintenance workers were able to return the ride to its unloading position minutes after first responders arrived. Portland Fire said about 30 people were on board. The amusement park statement said there were 28 riders. The ride has been in operation since 2021 and has not had any prior incidents, the park said. It will remain closed until further notice. The park said it would work with the ride's manufacturer and state inspectors to determine the cause of the stoppage. “We wish to express our deepest appreciation to the first responders and our staff for taking prompt action, leading to a positive outcome today, and to the rest of the park guests who swiftly followed directions to vacate the park to make way for the emergency responders to attend to the situation,” it said.  Oaks Park first opened in 1905. Its website says it offers a “uniquely Portland blend of modern thrills and turn-of-the-century charm on a midway that has delighted generations of Northwesterners.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The sun was yet to rise over the beaches of Normandy when, on June 6, 1944 -- 80 years ago this week -- thousands of American sons and Allied troops began what would become the largest amphibious assault in history. Their bravery and their sacrifice would turn the tide of World War II and push Nazi Germany to defeat. For the last five years, ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir and his team have traveled around the country documenting the stories of World War II veterans who landed on those beaches on D-Day and the days that followed. For the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion, Muir met these quiet heroes as they journeyed back to Normandy, many of them for the first time since landing there as young soldiers fighting for freedom.  Out of the 16.4 million Americans who served in the armed forces during WWII, less than 1% of them were still alive at the end of 2023, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The country loses an average of 131 WWII veterans every day.  Irving Locker is 99 years old, but in 1944 he was a 19-year-old staff sergeant in charge of 65 men. Drafted right out of high school in 1943, he went on to be in the First Army, 4th Infantry Div., 116th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Gun Battalion. And he was with his battalion that fateful day in June. His orders: land and run through the beach and start setting up your guns. He remembers the moment when -- at 5 feet tall -- he jumped into the frigid waters as German forces attacked the beaches. ""I've never seen as many dead men on the beaches as I've seen,"" he told ABC News of the invasion. ""Everybody was scared,"" Locker said. ""The long life we figured we're gonna have could be ended with one bullet, or one bomb, or one mine."" Reflecting on his acts of service and those who paid the ultimate price with their lives, Locker said, ""People have to know that freedom is not free."" ""So I'm doing that now with my full heart and conscience,"" he said of returning to Normandy.  Jack Claiborne of Dyersburg, Tennessee, drove the troops to Omaha Beach on LCI 492. He was a helmsman and gunner. ""Seeing all of these boys that was killed, and just layin’ there on the beach,"" Claiborne told ABC News in 2019. ""It was just ... tough for a little old kid to handle."" ""We were all young,"" he said. Claiborne died on September 28, 2023. His family told ABC News this year, he was proud to have served, and to have spent his last years talking about the war to younger generations.  At 102 years old, WWII veteran Andrew ""Tim"" Kiniry was just 22 when he landed on Omaha beach in the days after the invasion. With no time to think and there to help the injured as a medic with the 45th Evacuation Hospital, Kiniry said soldiers had to keep moving. As a young man at war, Kiniry kept a list of his outfit’s movements. Under June 1944, that list had two words: ""bloody beach.” Kiniry, who has lived in Vineland, New Jersey since 1964, fears the sacrifices of D-Day will be forgotten if veterans don’t share what they went through during the war. Not a day goes by he doesn’t think about the men lost during the invasion. Now 80 years later, he’s going back to Normandy for the first time since he first landed there. ""Eighty years, and the people of Normandy are still honoring us,"" Kiniry told Muir. ""That's somethin' that gets – gets to me.""  Harold Himmelsbach landed in Normandy on D-Day at age 18, and called it ""the most dramatic time"" in his life. Himmelsbach, who's now 98, said in an interview with Muir commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day that he remembers seeing ""things that very few people would ever see"" in their lifetime. ""I would see other guys die within feet of me."" ""You knew you had to do these things,"" he continued. ""It was just take care of your friend. And that’s what we all did."" He remembers the letter he wrote to his mother. “Dear mom I suppose I should begin by telling you I’m somewhere in France,"" Himmelsbach wrote.  Born and raised in Dora, Alabama, Harold McMurran served with the 546th Ord as a FA, Instrument Fire Control Repairman, on June 6, 1944, on Utah Beach and faced 300,000 Germans. Like many soldiers, McMurran kept a diary. On D-Day, he wrote, “June 6, 1944. Invasion started."" He wouldn't write in his diary for the next five days. In 2019, McMurran told ABC News he watched the medics trying to save his friends. ""Sometimes they would be in worse shape than the men they were trying to take care of,"" he said. ""People say, 'How did you get off that boat and go in on that beach?' There was a job had to be done,"" he said, holding back tears. ""Somebody had to do it. We did it."" McMurran, who received the French Legion of Honor Medal, died on Dec. 25, 2022.  Jake Ruser was a combat medic in Normandy with the 4th Infantry Division, 2nd Brigade Medical Detachment, 12 Inf. Reg. ""For 67 years, I never talked about it,"" he told Muir in the hallways of a high school in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, where he went to speak to a high school history class about the sacrifices made for freedom. Those students were nearly the same age that Ruser was when he was sent off to war. ""You always went with the idea you were gonna make it through,"" he told the students.  In Gainesville, Georgia, Alan Kinder prepared for his first trip back to Normandy since the invasion. He remembers how the country came together when word got out that American troops had landed in France. And the scene when he got to Utah beach in the middle of the night. ""We knew the people had to be killed,"" he told ABC News. ""You grow up in a hurry."" Kinder now grateful he gets to share his story, saying talking about it with his grandson, Justin, a history teacher, has brought them closer. They traveled together to Normandy. ""Being able to come here and experience this with him, it's – words can't describe it,"" Justin said. ""It's amazing.""  Onofrio Zicari, 96, of Las Vegas, fought with the 5th Amphibious Brigade, 5th Wave on D-Day. ""Man I was scared,"" Zicari told ABC News. ""I didn’t realize what war was until that day; it was awful.” Now, 80 years after answering the call, Ruser, Kimora, Locker, Kinder and Zicari return to Normandy with help from the nonprofit, “Forever Young Veterans.” Just before the anniversary commemorations, the five brave heroes journeyed back to Utah beach, where Muir met them. Kinder, who has not set foot back on that beach until now, said he is grateful to be here. This is also the first time he has seen Utah Beach in the daylight. ""When they told me there was a chance to come here, I've kinda lived my life over again,"" he said. ""I've really, really enjoyed that."" Locker told Muir that returning to Normandy meant that he came back because he’s determined to honor the sacrifices of D-Day, and hopes to connect with the next generation. ""I thank God every single day that I'm alive and well,"" he said. ""And people have to know that. People have to know that."" Kiniry told Muir being back in Utah Beach reminded him of the brave men, his brothers, who were lost. ""It means a great deal to me to be here today to honor ... the ones that lost their lives in particular,"" he told Muir.  Ruser also took notice of the large number of people honoring the sacrifices WWII veterans made in Normandy. And as strangers approached them to shake their hands, he was moved by their gratitude. ""We're meeting people from all over the world,"" he said. ""It's really – something when you're remembering what happened 80 years ago here."" Zicari, who Muir first met five years ago, returned to Normandy again, thinking of the future. ""We fought for freedom,"" he said. ""We gotta have the younger generation help us now."" ""We're depending on them. They depended on us. We're gonna depend on them now,"" Zicari added.  Diane Hight, the founder of ""Forever Young Veterans,"" told Muir about the mission they hope to achieve. ""We must never forget,"" she said. ""A lot of people think, 'Oh. Well, how nice that you take these vets on trips.' These are not vacations."" ""Do you know why they really wanna come back?"" she continued. ""They want to say to their friends that did not come home, 'I haven't forgotten you. And I hope I've lived my life where you're proud of me.'""

52,DEMETRIS NELLAS Associated Press,Body of missing British TV presenter Michael Mosley found on Greek island,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/body-missing-british-tv-presenter-michael-mosley-found-110967047,The family of missing British TV presenter Dr. Michael Mosley have confirmed his body has been found on a Greek island,2024-06-09T17:27:53Z,"The family of missing British TV presenter Dr. Michael Mosley have confirmed his body has been found on a Greek island ATHENS -- The body of missing British TV presenter and author Dr. Michael Mosley was found on a Greek island Sunday morning after a days-long search, his family said. Mosley, who went missing on the island of Symi on Wednesday afternoon, was spotted among rocks on a rugged stretch of coast by a party on a boat that included the local mayor and journalists.  Mosley’s wife said her husband took the wrong route on a hike and collapsed just short of reaching a marina in a place where his body couldn’t easily be seen.  “Michael was an adventurous man, it’s part of what made him so special,” Dr. Clare Bailey Mosley said in statement. “It’s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together.” Mosley, 67, was well known in Britain for his many programs on the BBC, regular appearances on television and radio and his column in the Daily Mail newspaper. He was known outside the U.K. for his 2013 book “The Fast Diet,” which he co-authored with journalist Mimi Spencer. The book proposed the so-called “5:2 diet,” which promised to help people lose weight quickly by minimizing their calorie intake two days a week while eating healthily on the other five. He subsequently introduced a rapid weight loss program and made a number of films about diet and exercise. Mosley often pushed his body to extreme lengths to see the effects of his diets and also lived with tapeworms in his guts for six weeks for the BBC documentary “Infested! Living With Parasites.” Even before the body’s identity was confirmed, tributes poured in for Mosley. “In person he was very much the sort of figure that you would see on television: immediately likeable, genuinely funny, enthusiastic, he had this innate enthusiasm about life and he was always very generous with his time,"" his co-author Spencer told BBC Radio 4. “He never blew his trumpet, he was quite a humble person.” Tom Watson, former deputy leader of Britain’s Labour Party, called Mosley a hero and said he lost nearly 100 pounds (45 kilograms) following one of the doctor’s diet books. “It’s hard to describe how upset I am by this news,” Watson said on the social media platform X. “Through courageous, science-based journalism, Michael Mosley has helped thousands of people get well and healthy. I’m one of them.” Dr. Saleyha Ahsan, who was co-host on “Trust Me, I’m A Doctor,” said Mosley had a talent for putting people at ease and explaining science to a general audience, “not just a niche scientific crowd, but to everyone.” “Michael’s a national treasure and he’s so personable,” Ahsan told the BBC. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver said Mosley’s research and TV shows had served the public well and changed the conversation around health issues. “What a wonderfully sweet, kind and gentle man he was,” Oliver said on Instagram. Clare Bailey Mosley thanked the people of the island of Symi, who she said worked tirelessly to find him. “Some of these people on the island, who hadn’t even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked,” she said. “My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It’s clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you.” Lefteris Papakalodoukas, the island’s mayor, told The Associated Press that he was on a boat with journalists when they saw a body some 65 feet (20 meters) above the Agia Marina beach. He said Mosley was lying face-up next to a fence. “We zoomed with the cameras and saw it was him,” he said.  Ilias Tsavaris, a bar manager at the marina, said he scrambled up the hillside after getting a call from the boat telling him to confirm the sighting.  “When I walked up I saw something like a body,"" he said. “You don’t see a dead body everyday, it is not a warzone, it’s summer, you are supposed to have fun and swimming.” As police officers were retrieving Mosley's body, one fell on the slope and had to be carried away on a stretcher, local media reported. The body will be taken to the nearby island of Rhodes for autopsy. Mosley had four children with his wife, who is also an author and health columnist. ___ Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed to this report from London. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Peter Lerner separately praised a recent Israeli hostage rescue operation that freed four Israeli captives in Gaza amid fierce fighting against Hamas. Sullivan said the Biden administration has been ""working for months"" with Israel to help it recover the remaining hostages from Gaza, some of whom are believed to be dead, while pressing for precautions to be taken to avoid civilian casualties as rescue efforts continue. ""The United States will support Israel and taking steps to try to rescue hostages who are currently being held in harm, held by Hamas, and we will continue to work with Israel to do that. We will also continue to reinforce the point that all of their military operations, including hostage rescue operations, should take every precaution to minimize the amount of civilian harm or civilian casualties,"" Sullivan told ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. The comments come after an expansive operation in central Gaza to free hostages Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv.  At least 274 people were killed in central Gaza on Saturday as the Israeli military moved into the Nuseirat camp to rescue the four hostages, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday. Another 698 people were injured as Israeli forces entered the refugee camp, the ministry said. Israel's military said no more than 100 civilians were killed in the operation. When pressed by Raddatz on Sunday on the disparity, Sullivan said the administration is ""looking into it"" while highlighting a three-tiered cease-fire proposal President Joe Biden said came from the Israelis that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tweaked in recent days and Hamas has not yet agreed to. ""We see individual instances that we have spoken out about where we would like to see them operate differently, where we would like them to be more precise, more targeted in their operations. And we will continue to speak out on those issues,"" Sullivan told Raddatz. ""If Hamas came and said yes to the deal on the table, there would be an end to the need for these kinds of operations, because the hostages would be coming out peacefully and not through military actions."" Biden has become increasingly outspoken in his criticism of the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza, while remaining steadfastly supportive of efforts to recover hostages taken during Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people. The death toll in Gaza since the war broke out climbed on Saturday to 37,084 people, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said. More than 84,000 others have been injured since Oct. 7, the ministry said. Lerner on Sunday blamed Hamas for the high death toll in Gaza, accusing the group of putting civilians in harm's way. ""Every civilian life lost in this war is a result of how Hamas has operated,"" he told Raddatz. ""Let’s think about, just for a moment, where they were holding the hostages. Within civilian houses. Within people’s apartments. In the same apartment they were being held [were] the families that owned the apartments. This exemplifies specifically how Hamas are operating."" Lerner said the Israeli military could conduct similar operations to recover hostages -- but that Israel is also open to negotiations for their return. ""The 120 hostages remain in the clutches of Hamas. There can be a rescue mission like what happened yesterday,"" he said. ""But there could also have been negotiations that create the opportunity. Our role is to create the conditions either way, that Hamas realizes that they should give back the hostages, they should set the hostages free."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The Israeli political security cabinet ""discussed steps to strengthen settlements in the West Bank, among other things, in response to countries that unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state after October 7,"" in a meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Spain, Ireland and Norway recognized Palestine as a state at the end of May. Separately, 143 of the 193 members in the UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution stating that Palestinians qualify for full-member status at the United Nations at the beginning of May, according to the New York Times. The cabinet also discussed ""a series of reactions against the Palestinian Authority following its actions against Israel in international bodies,"" the statement added.

""In Gaza, innocent civilians are suffering the horrors of the war between Hamas and Israel.,"" Biden said. ""Too many innocent people have been killed, including thousands of children. Families have fled their homes and seen their communities destroyed. Their pain is immense."" Biden added that his administration is working to end the war and make progress toward a two-state solution. ""And I strongly believe that the three-phase ceasefire proposal Israel has made to Hamas and that the U.N. Security Council has endorsed is the best way to end the violence in Gaza and ultimately end the war,"" Biden said. Biden also cited the conflict in Sudan as well as the targeting of Muslim communities in Burma and China. He used the holiday to celebrate the contributions of the Muslim community in America and also to say that he is committed to fighting Islamophobia in the United States. ""Hate has no place in America, whether it is targeted at American Muslims, Arab Americans including Palestinians, or anyone else,"" Biden said.

After an inquiry, the prime minister was informed that there was no change in Isreal Defense Forces policy and that the fighting in Rafah would continue as planned, the official said. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari released a statement in Hebrew shortly after announcement saying the pause will affect a single aid route.

55,"Peter Charalambous, Aaron Katersky, Katherine Faulders",Trump to undergo probation interview for NY hush money case Monday afternoon: Sources,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-undergo-probation-interview-ny-hush-money-case/story?id=110971057,"Trump is expected to attend a presentencing interview on Monday afternoon ahead of his July 11 sentencing in his New York criminal case, sources said.",2024-06-10T09:04:21Z,"A probation officer is expected to prepare a report ahead of sentencing. Former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a presentencing interview on Monday afternoon ahead of his July 11 sentencing in his New York criminal case, according to sources familiar with the matter. A probation officer is expected to conduct the interview – which Trump will attend remotely from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida – to prepare a report recommending the appropriate punishment for Judge Juan Merchan to impose at the former president’s sentencing next month. Last month, a jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to hide information from voters ahead of the 2016 election, including a $130,000 money payment to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had an affair with him, which he has denied. Although defendants typically attend their interview with probation officials without the presence of counsel, Judge Merchan signed an order last week permitting Trump’s defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, to attend the interview.  The interview will not be public, and the report prepared ahead of Trump’s sentence will likely remain under seal. In the New York state courts, a probation officer, social worker, or psychologist usually interviews a defendant convicted of a crime to better access their personal and criminal history before preparing a presentence report for the judge overseeing the case. According to Pace University law professor Bennett Gershman, that report is particularly important in cases where a judge accepts a guilty plea or is unfamiliar with the defendant’s background and conduct. ""It's a lengthy investigation that the probation services do for the judge, and it's done to give the judge as much information as they can glean in terms of the defendant’s background,"" Gershman told ABC News. Depending on the nature of the crime, a probation officer could speak with the defendant’s family, the victim, or individuals involved in the investigation to prepare their report. The report normally covers a defendant’s personal history, finances, professional work, criminal record and background information about the crime. The interview also presents the defendant an opportunity to present positive information about himself and make the case for a lighter sentence ""if a person is able to garner the sympathy of the probation officer, and they write a report that is more … sympathetic or casts the defendant in a more positive light,"" said Fordham Law professor Cheryl Bader.  However, Bader cautioned that the report is unlikely to serve a vital role in Trump’s case because the judge is already familiar with the alleged conduct and Trump’s overall character. The former president frequently targeted the judge throughout the trial -- accusing him of being biased and conflicted -- and was held in criminal contempt 10 times for violating the case’s limited gag order. ""The judge is very well acquainted with Donald Trump and the circumstances of this case, and so is probably going to be less influenced by details that are in the presentence report,"" Bader said. While the interview is unlikely to shed new details about Trump’s conduct or character, according to Gershman, it could work against Trump if he demonstrates contempt toward the probation officer. ""If Trump gave certain answers that showed a disrespect or a disregard for the system, the judge -- the things he has been saying all along -- the judge will certainly cite that,"" Gershman said. ""If Trump makes an apology, shows remorse … the judge would cite that."" The report prepared by the probation officer -- in addition to the sentencing submissions prepared by both sides -- will be used by Merchan to consider what kind of sentence to impose on July 11. Trump was convicted of 34 class-E felonies, the lowest level felonies in New York state that carry a maximum four-year sentence. Merchan could opt to impose prison time, probation, or conditional discharge, including conditions like community service or fines. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A deleted document that investigators recovered from a laptop may be the key to establishing intent in the case against Rex Heuermann, who has been charged with the murders of six women over several decades, Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney told ABC News on Friday. That document, which investigators described as a ""planning document,"" was discovered in a veritable mountain of electronic devices and files recovered during the investigation, Tierney said. It was found on March 7, 2024, on a laptop's unallocated space, meaning it had been deleted by a user, the district attorney said. Prosecutors allege it was used by Heuermann to ""methodically blueprint and plan out his kills with excruciating detail."" ""I think it, first and foremost, evinces a certain intent, and that intent is to hunt and capture and kill females,"" Tierney told ABC News in an interview, some of which aired on ""Good Morning America.""  His office was ""excited"" about the document, because it ""establishes intent, and certainly that's our allegation -- and that's what we seek to prove,"" Tierney said. Investigators on the case said they found the document as they worked through a wealth of tech items recovered during the investigation. They so far have recovered 27 computers and 58 internal hard drives, along with another 22 external drives. They've collected 15 types of cameras. And there are dozens of memory cards and USB devices and SIM cards. Hundreds of CDs and VHS cassettes were also logged by investigators. That document was discovered almost a year after the initial charges were filed in July 2023 against Heuermann, a Long Island architect who has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. Heuermann was charged Thursday with the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor, whose remains were found on Long Island at Gilgo Beach and in Manorville, and the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla, whose remains were found in North Sea, Long Island, in 1993, according to court documents. These developments expand the timeline in the Gilgo Beach case by a full decade.  The charges brought against Heuermann allege that he acted alone, according to court documents. Prosecutors have said in charging documents that they've pieced together a timeline of the murders using digital calendars and notes from some of the devices they've collected. Heuermann's estranged wife, Asa Ellerup, and their children were away from their Massapequa Park home during the commission of the crimes, investigators allege. ""With regard to the family, it's very clear that during the commission of the six crimes … they were either outside of the state or outside of the country,"" Tierney told ABC News. Investigators have spent months essentially going ""back in time"" through the ""tremendous"" amount of evidence in the Heuermann case, Tierney said. They've also during the same period been going through cold-case killings and other open investigations, he said. Several other bodies were discovered over the years on Gilgo Beach, near the brambles where the bodies of four of Heuermann's alleged victims were discovered. ""We're going to continue to look at the cases,"" Tierney said on ""GMA"" on Friday. ""We've got more bodies on Gilgo Beach and we have more bodies off of the beach as well, which has resulted in these two additional charges. We'll continue to work."" ABC News asked Tierney whether his office had thought the allegations against Heuermann would stretch as far back as 1993. ""In the beginning, we knew that this was going to be a sprawling, significant case,"" Tierney said. ""And we really had no preconceptions. I think the better way to answer that: Am I surprised? No."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Justice Clarence Thomas has formally disclosed for the first time trips to Bali, Indonesia and the elite Bohemian Grove club in California -- both paid for by his friend and billionaire Harlan Crow -- that were at the center of an explosive ProPublica report last year exposing the unreported financial ties to a GOP benefactor. Thomas acknowledged in his latest annual financial report, released Friday, that he had ""inadvertently omitted"" reimbursement for food and lodging expenses for the July 2019 travel. He did not disclose the value of the one-night hotel stay in Bali or three-night stay at the private club. The justice also did not disclose private jet transportation to Indonesia or travel on a luxury yacht, both of which were reportedly provided by Crow. Thomas reported no travel or reimbursements for 2023. He reports accepting one gift last year: a pair of $2,000 photo albums from Terry Giroux, the outgoing executive director of the Horatio Alger Association. The filings, as required by the Ethics and Government Act of 1978, are the first from Thomas and the other justices since the Supreme Court released a formal Code of Conduct late last year, prompted in part by the controversy surrounding Thomas' previously undisclosed ties to Crow.  Justice Samuel Alito was the only justice who received an extension to file his report. The filings offer one of the only windows into the financial interests of the Supreme Court justices and their spouses, providing a modicum of transparency to an otherwise highly opaque branch of government. While few of the justices reported accepting any gifts of value last year, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted more than $12,500 in donated art to decorate her chambers and four Beyonce concert tickets worth more than $3,711.  Several justices reported earning six-figure book royalties well above their government salaries. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has a legal memoir in the works, reported a $340,000 advance from Regenery Publishing. Justice Jackson, whose memoir is due for release in September, noted a $893,750 advance from Penguin Random House. Justice Neil Gorsuch reported a $250,000 book royalty from Harper Collins, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted an $86,783 payout from Penguin. Associate justices each earn $298,500 in annual government salary; the chief justice earns $312,200. Additional ""outside earned income"" is capped at $32,000 per year under federal judiciary rules. ""Each justice would be capable of earning 10 times their current salary in the private sector, so it's reasonable for them to want to boost their income as authors, especially those with inspiring life stories,"" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a left-leaning watchdog group. ""This may be an unpopular opinion, but I don't see anything ethically compromising about it so long as the justices don't use their offices to hawk books, they speak to ideologically diverse audiences on their book tours, and they recuse from petitions involving their publishers."" Justice Sotomayor reported earning $1,879 for a voice performance in the animated PBS television series ""Alma's Way."" Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch each reported more than $10,000 in teaching income at law schools.  Many of the justices also indicated acceptance of all-expenses-paid trips last year for professional functions – such as conference lectures, academic ceremonies, and historic commemorations. Chief Justice John Roberts was the only member of the Supreme Court to list no gifts, outside income or travel reimbursement of any kind. Roth said there are also indications that several justices paid their own way for certain, publicly-reported trips that didn't appear on the forms – including Justice Elena Kagan's trip to San Diego to christen a Navy ship and her attendance at a tennis tournament. Justice Barrett also appears to have declined $5,000 honorariums for speaking at the University of Minnesota Law School. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

All in a day's work for one of the world's elite participants in cliff diving — a sport in which sometimes the precipice isn't a cliff at all. Iffland, from Australia, said the competition among cliff divers jumping from the Institute of Contemporary Art during a Saturday contest in Boston was fierce. “I know the pressure's coming — and the young girls are diving super well,” Iffland said after winning the women's section. Iffland's victory was part of cliff diving's marquee event, which came to the hub of New England as the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series made the 100th stop in its history. Participants plunged from up to 90 feet (27 meters) in the air from the waterfront art museum into the chilly harbor below. British diver Aidan Heslop won the men's competition and said, “We've all got our work cut out for us” for the rest of the series. Boston is the only U.S. stop this year. The series wraps up in Sydney, Australia, in November. Cliff diving attracts a special kind of athlete, especially when winning means leaping from an art museum into potentially frigid waters below, organizers said. “These epic athletes train super hard to make sure every leap, somersault, twist and entry is perfect,” organizers said in a statement. Practice and early competition rounds were held Friday. Judges scores Saturday's competitive round based on the divers' form and technique. Two dozen people competed. It was the third straight year that the popular spectator event has come to Boston. Organizers said it drew 45,000 people for the weekend. The art museum said in a statement that the event was a visually stunning opportunity for the public and a chance for the athletes to earn “crucial championship points along the way based on their final event positions.” ___ Whittle reported from Portland, Maine. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The lawmakers are all military veterans, and were led by Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and Michael Waltz, R-Fla. The other participants included: Reps. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, Rich McCormick, R-Ga., Mark Green, R-Tenn., Cory Mills, R-Fla., Darrell Issa, R-Calif. and Keith Self, R-Texas. Crow, an Army Ranger who served in two units that played key roles in the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, said the jump was a ""very personal experience."" ""To participate in the jump over the same fields 80 years to the week was an incredible experience and my way of highlighting that service and sacrifice,"" Crow said.  In an interview with ABC News' Jay O'Brien before the jump, Crow said the jump is about remembering that ""America is at its best when we come together, unite under common cause and purpose."" ""We serve and we make individual sacrifices to do big and important things,"" Crow said in an interview in Washington shortly before leaving for France. ""And in an era where we're wondering about our place in the world, about American leadership, this is a reminder that American leadership matters."" Before departing Washington, Waltz said the jump honors World War II veterans and pays respect to their sacrifice. ""This will be the last major anniversary with the World War II veterans. The youngest that we know of is 96. The oldest is 107. We need to honor them and need to keep their story and their sacrifice alive,"" Waltz said. ""What better way to pass that story on to the next generation than by jumping out of a perfectly good World War II-era aircraft?"" Waltz, the first Green Beret to serve in Congress, said that ""American people need to see"" lawmakers from across the aisle come together, and that electing more veterans to Congress would benefit the country. ""If we're all in a tank or a ship or a plane together just a few years ago, as veterans, as Americans, we're all willing to die together and we should be able to roll up our sleeves and get things done,"" Waltz said. Both Crow and Waltz performed a parachute jump over Normandy with French paratroopers five years ago, for the 75th anniversary of D-Day.  ""There's no better way to get you out of the airplane than to be in an 80-year-old aircraft,"" Crow joked. ""It freaks me out a little bit. But these pilots are great. The maintenance is great. It's a very, very safe exercise."" Crow said that while the plane on Friday was small and noisy, it flew well. ""The pilots were fantastic ... it underscored for me how more advanced our systems are,"" Crow said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders, who took the iconic ""Earthrise"" photograph while in lunar orbit that showed the Earth from the moon's surface, has died, NASA administrator Bill Nelson said Friday. He was 90. Anders was piloting a Beechcraft plane that plummeted into the waters off the San Juan Islands in Washington state on Friday morning, authorities said. He was the only person onboard the aircraft and his body has since been recovered, according to the Coast Guard. Anders' famous ""Earthrise"" photo was taken on Christmas Eve in 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission. ""Bill Anders offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give. He traveled to the threshold of the Moon and helped all of us see something else: ourselves. He embodied the lessons and the purpose of exploration. We will miss him,"" Nelson said in a statement. The Apollo 8 crew was composed of Commander Frank Borman, Lunar Module Pilot Anders and Command Module Pilot James Lovell. The three served as the crew for the first manned Apollo mission launched aboard the Saturn V and the crewmembers became the first humans to enter lunar orbit and travel to the far side of the moon. Anders was born in Hong Kong and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1955. He went on to receive a commission in the U.S. Air Force and obtain a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1962. In late 1963, Anders ""was among just 14 men chosen by NASA from a pool of thousands of applicants"" for the Astronaut Corps, according to the Heritage Flight Museum. Anders founded the Heritage Flight Museum in 1996 with his wife, Valerie Anders, in Bellingham, Washington. President Richard Nixon appointed Anders to become executive secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council in 1969. Apollo 8 was Anders' only space flight. Nelson added in a statement Saturday, ""The voyage Bill took in 1968 was only one of the many remarkable chapters in Bill's life and service to humanity. In his 26 years of service to our country, Bill was many things – U.S. Air Force officer, astronaut, engineer, ambassador, advisor, and much more. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating Friday's crash. Anders is survived by his wife Valerie, four sons and two daughters. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A 6-year-old girl died days after she was accidentally injured by a badminton racket while on vacation with her family in Maine, police said. Lucy Morgan, of Stockholm, New Jersey, was playing with her older brother outside a home in Limerick on June 1 when the incident occurred, according to the Maine Department of Public Safety.  ""Investigators learned that the aluminum shaft of a badminton racquet had become dislodged from the wooden handle, causing the shaft to strike the girl in the head, piercing through her skull,"" the Maine Department of Public Safety said in a press release. Lucy was sitting on the sideline when the ""freak accident"" occurred, her father, Jesse Morgan, a pastor at Green Pond Bible Chapel in Newfoundland, New Jersey, said in a blog post following the incident. The racket broke on a downward swing and the sharp piece caused a catastrophic brain injury, he said. First responders brought Lucy to a hospital in Sanford before transporting her via helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland, where she died from her injuries on Wednesday, police said.  ""There is so much more to say, scripture to unravel, people to thank, and tears to be cried,"" Jesse Morgan said on his blog, urging people to ""hug your kids more.""

63,Alexander Mallin,FBI's latest data show 'historic' drop in crime: Garland,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbis-latest-data-show-historic-drop-crime-garland/story?id=110989589,"The first three months of 2024 saw a continued drop in levels of violent crime and murder across the country, according to data released by the FBI on Monday.",2024-06-10T20:50:49Z,"Reported incidents of violent crime dropped 15%, according to the FBI data. The first three months of 2024 saw a continued drop in levels of violent crime and murder across the country, according to data released by the FBI on Monday -- a trend that Attorney General Merrick Garland called ""historic."" Reported incidents of violent crime dropped 15% between January and March of this year compared to the same period last year, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Data. Murders dropped by more than 26% in the same time period, the data shows. The FBI has not released details about the number of incidents for the categories of crime. It will do so when 80% participation levels are met, the agency said.  ""This data makes clear that last year's historic decline in violent crime is continuing,"" Garland said in a statement highlighting the new statistics. ""This continued historic decline in homicides does not represent abstract statistics. It represents people whose lives were saved -- people who are still here to see their children grow up, to work toward fulfilling their dreams, and to contribute to their communities."" Crime is a key issue for voters in an election year, and President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are working to highlight their crime-reduction plans in what is expected to be a very close race this November. ""President Biden has worked hard to clean up [Trump's] mess, and it’s working,"" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement, referencing the new FBI data. Biden himself put out a statement late Monday afternoon as he returned to the White House from Delaware. ""Violent crime is dropping at record levels in America. It’s good news for our families and our communities,"" he said. ""This progress we’re seeing is no accident. My Administration is putting more cops on the beat, holding violent criminals accountable, and getting illegal guns off the street – and we are doing it in partnership with communities. As a result, Americans are safer today than when I took office,"" he added. As president, Biden has backed community policing and violence intervention efforts and called for more mental and social services funding. In his State of the Union address earlier this year, Biden boasted that the nation reported a historically low murder rate in 2023 and violent crime had plummeted to one of the lowest levels in 50 years. Trump is touting the role he played in enacting the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law that reduced some mandatory minimum prison sentences, gave judges the power to sentence nonviolent drug offenders to less time behind bars and more, such as increasing job training to lower recidivism rates. Last month, Trump became the first U.S. president ever convicted of a felony.  The number released Monday further build off data released earlier this year by the FBI, which showed murders dropped nationwide by 13% through 2023. That data also showed cities with populations of more than 1 million saw an 11% drop in overall crime. Experts told ABC News late that year that the recent drop in homicides and other violent crimes can be attributed to expanded efforts to prevent crime, including working with community volunteers, targeting gun possession in high-crime areas and placing officers on foot and bike patrols. Still, perception of crime often does not match up with the numbers. More than three-quarters of Americans said that there is more crime in the U.S. than a year ago and more than half of Americans said the same about crime in their local area, according to a Gallup poll from November. The data from the FBI also shows that reported incidents of rape dropped by 25% from last year, robbery dropped by more than 17%, and aggravated assault fell by more than 12%. Property crime similarly dropped by more than 15%, according to the data. Some crime data experts have cautioned not to rely too much on the FBI's numbers, noting their largely preliminary nature that only covers roughly 77% of the nation's total population -- even if their broader assessment of decreasing crime across the country rings true. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
64,Meredith Deliso,1 dead after bus hijacking in Georgia; suspect in custody: Police,https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-bus-hijacking-shooting/story?id=111038793,"One person was fatally shot in connection with a bus hijacking that spanned several counties in Georgia on Tuesday, authorities said.",2024-06-11T23:19:45Z,"More than a dozen passengers were on the bus when it was hijacked, police said. The suspect in a bus hijacking that prompted a police chase in Georgia allegedly got into a fight with a passenger before fatally shooting him with the victim's own gun, authorities said. The incident began at approximately 4:35 p.m. ET Tuesday in downtown Atlanta, when police responded to a report of gunfire on a Gwinnett County Transit bus and a ""possible hostage situation,"" the Atlanta Police Department said. ""Upon the officers' arrival at the scene, the bus fled the location, and a pursuit ensued,"" the Atlanta Police Department said in a press release. The suspect -- identified as 39-year-old Joseph Grier, of Stone Mountain -- allegedly got into an argument with a male passenger after boarding the bus in downtown Atlanta, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The two got into a fight when the passenger then pulled out a gun, GBI said. Grier allegedly took the man's gun and ""began threatening passengers with it,"" GBI said in a statement Wednesday. ""Grier then shot the passenger and ordered the bus driver to flee the scene while threatening passengers with the gun,"" GBI said. The suspect held the bus driver at gunpoint during the hijacking, according to Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. There were 17 people on the bus at the time, including the bus driver, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum.  During the pursuit, police received a 911 call from a family member of an occupant of the bus ""saying he was receiving text messages that there had been a hijacking and that individuals were being held hostage against their will,"" Schierbaum told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday evening. Police then received another 911 call made from the bus, which remained open throughout the pursuit and provided information that helped ""craft an end of this hostage situation,"" the chief said. The ensuing pursuit spanned multiple jurisdictions, during which police attempted ""various tactics"" to stop the bus, police said. The bus hit several police vehicles during the pursuit, GBI said. The vehicle was ultimately disabled in Stone Mountain in DeKalb County, approximately 16 miles northeast of where the incident began, police said. A Georgia State Patrol trooper fired his patrol rifle into the engine compartment of the bus, causing it to malfunction and stop running, according to GBI. Once the bus stopped, DeKalb County SWAT officers positioned a Bearcat armored vehicle ""to prevent any avenues of escape,"" the DeKalb County Police Department said in a statement. Grier was taken into custody without further incident, police said. SWAT officers found the gunshot victim while clearing the bus, DeKalb County police said. Police identified the victim as Ernest Byrd, 58. Grier is accused of ""knowingly and intentionally"" shooting the victim in the leg and causing his death, according to the arrest affidavit. He has been charged with murder, as well as 14 counts of aggravated assault, 14 counts of kidnapping, hijacking a motor vehicle, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, police said Wednesday. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said her office is unable to prosecute the case because one of her employees was on the bus, according to a letter she sent Wednesday to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia requesting substitute counsel.  Byrd's family said they are heartbroken by the ""senseless act"" and said more details are needed to ""fully comprehend the nature of this tragedy."" ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our beloved husband, father, friend, uncle and grandfather,"" his family said in a statement. ""He was a man known for his unwavering dedication to resolving conflicts and protecting others."" No other injuries were reported in the incident. The investigation remains ongoing, Atlanta police said. GBI said it is also investigating the use of force by the state trooper. A shaken passenger on the hijacked bus said the ordeal was ""traumatic"" and she is ""thankful to be alive."" ""It was something that we'd never forget,"" Paulette Gilbert, 60, told Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB, adding that she has ridden the bus for many years without incident. The bus shooting and hijacking occurred after a separate, unrelated incident gunfire broke out at a food court at a downtown Atlanta shopping center on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Three people were injured, and an off-duty Atlanta police officer shot the armed suspect, police said. The suspect in the bus hijacking boarded the bus near the shopping center but was not involved in that shooting, Schierbaum said. A ""common theme"" was that the suspects in both incidents are convicted felons, he said. Grier spoke to reporters following the incident at the food court, as media outlets sought witness reactions to that shooting before police say he then hijacked the bus. In an interview with The Associated Press, Grier said he was in ""extreme mode"" when he saw the food court shooter and that he had knives on him but ""couldn't get a gun."" He also said he is bipolar. Grier is being held at the Fulton County Jail. It is unclear if he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. Dickens said Tuesday he believes mental health ""is going to play a role"" in the incidents but added, ""You're talking about too many guns in the hands of individuals that should not have guns."" The mayor decried the spate of gun violence and said Tuesday's incidents ""reflected a breakdown in the criminal justice system and our social structures on multiple levels."" ""I am both sad and I am angry that individuals that were going about their daily lives -- those that were just taking a bus ride home and those that were there for lunch or late lunch or having a gathering -- they really should not have to suffer that kind of trauma,"" the mayor said Wednesday. ""These are the types of senseless acts of violence that we are trying to prevent here. They hurt families, they hurt businesses, and they hurt our beloved communities."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
65,Katie Kindelan,Trooping the Colour details: All eyes on potential Kate Middleton appearance,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/what-to-know-kate-middleton-trooping-the-colour/story?id=111023933,Kate stepped back from public duties after announcing her cancer diagnosis in March.,2024-06-11T18:08:40Z,"Both Kate and King Charles, who are each battling cancer, will attend this year. Trooping the Colour, the annual military parade marking the reigning British monarch's official birthday, is one of the biggest and most highly anticipated events of the year for Britain's royal family. This year's parade, to be held on Saturday, June 15, will mark an even bigger milestone, with both King Charles III and Kate, the Princess of Wales, attending. Since January, both Charles and Kate, his daughter-in-law, have been diagnosed with cancer and have had to take time away from public duties. Charles has since returned to a modified schedule of public duties while Kate has not been seen publicly since March, when she revealed her cancer diagnosis in a video message. Kate's last public appearance with members of the royal family was on Christmas Day. Here are your questions answered about who will attend this year's Trooping the Colour and what to expect. Yes, Charles will attend this year's Trooping the Colour, according to Buckingham Palace. The king will slightly modify his role in the annual event by riding in a horse-drawn carriage alongside his wife Queen Camilla instead of on horseback, according to the palace. This year's Trooping the Colour marks the second for Charles as king. His coronation was held on May 6, 2023. Charles' cancer diagnosis was announced in February. The palace has not specified the type of cancer he has, the stage of cancer or the type of treatment. Yes, Kate will also attend this year's celebration. Kate said in a written message released Friday that she is ""looking forward"" to attending what will be her first public appearance with members of the royal family since her cancer diagnosis. ""I'm looking forward to attending The King's Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,"" she said, adding that she continues to undergo chemotherapy treatments. ""I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal."" As in years past, Kate is expected to take part in the parade and watch the military flyover from the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside her husband Prince William and their three children.  Kate's last in-person royal public appearance was in December, when she joined members of the royal family at a Christmas Day church service in Sandringham. When Kate announced her cancer diagnosis in March, which she said came following ""major abdominal surgery"" in January, the palace said she had begun a course of preventative chemotherapy. No further details have been shared about her treatment or what type of cancer Kate was diagnosed with. The palace said at the time that Kate would return to official duties when she's cleared by her medical team to do so. After Kensington Palace confirmed that Kate would miss this year's Colonel's Review, a final rehearsal held one week before Trooping the Colour, the princess issued a written apology to the Irish Guards. Kate holds the title of honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards. ""I wanted to write and let you know how proud I am of the entire regiment ahead of the Colonel's Review and Trooping of the Colour,"" she wrote in the letter, posted on X by the regiment. ""I appreciate everyone trooping this year has been practicing for months and dedicating many hours to ensuring their uniforms and drill are immaculate."" Kate continued, ""Being your colonel remains a great honor, and I am very sorry that I'm unable to take the salute at this year's Colonel's Review. Please pass my apologies to the whole Regiment, however, I do hope that I am able to represent you all once again very soon. Please send my very best wishes and good luck to all involved."" Yes. William and Kate's children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, will appear at Trooping the Colour. ABC News understands Kate and her children will travel together in a state carriage down the Mall. Last year, the Wales children joined Kate and Camilla in a carriage along the parade route, and then joined other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a flyover. No, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are not expected to attend the king's birthday parade. Harry, Charles' younger son, and Meghan live in California with their two young children and are no longer senior working royals. Harry and Meghan's last public appearance with the royal family at Trooping the Colour was in 2019, shortly after Meghan gave birth to the couple's eldest child Archie. The Sussexes also attended the late Queen Elizabeth II's Trooping the Colour in 2022, on the occasion of her Platinum Jubilee. Harry and Meghan did not join other royal family members on the balcony of Buckingham Palace though because they are no longer working royals. The parade, which will begin around 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, travels from Buckingham Palace, down the Mall and to the Horse Guards Parade before returning to Buckingham Palace. Over 1,400 soldiers and military officers take part in the parade, which also includes 200 horses and over 400 musicians from 10 military bands, according to the U.K.'s Household Division.  On arrival at Horse Guards Parade, the royal party goes to a viewing position on a balcony overlooking the parade ground while the king, having inspected the troops, watches from a special platform, or dais, on the parade ground as the soldiers parade past. After the parade, the royal party returns along the Mall in their carriages. The king will then take a final salute before joining the rest of the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the Royal Air Force flypast to mark his birthday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
66,TOM KRISHER AP auto writer,Thefts of charging cables pose yet another obstacle to appeal of electric vehicles,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/thefts-charging-cables-pose-obstacle-appeal-electric-vehicles-111044462,"Across the U.S., thieves have been targeting electric-vehicle charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring",2024-06-12T04:48:35Z,"Across the U.S., thieves have been targeting electric-vehicle charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring DETROIT -- Just before 2 a.m. on a chilly April night in Seattle, a Chevrolet Silverado pickup stopped at an electric vehicle charging station on the edge of a shopping center parking lot.  Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2½ minutes, they were gone. The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material. The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful. Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don’t know of any charging stations nearby.  If even finding a charging station doesn't necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now. America's major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs. Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 — about 45% of its global sales — though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035. Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn't likely to strengthen the automakers' case. Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation’s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 — four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America's vice president of operations. ""We’re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,"" Lambkin said. “So to have an entire station that’s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.” Two other leading EV charging companies — Flo and EVgo — also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too. Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation's largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said. “Vandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,"" EVgo said.  The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution. The problem isn't confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station. Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit. In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away. In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging. “They're not just taking one,"" Carson said. ""When they're hit, they're hit pretty hard.” Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables. “If my battery was really low, I’d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,” he said. “If it was so low that I couldn’t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.” The charging companies say it's become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases.  Charging companies say there isn't actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard.  ""They're not making a significant amount of money,” he said. “They're not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.” Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch $400.  The problem for the charging companies is that it's much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works. The charging companies are trying to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal. But it's often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal. The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods. Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed.

67,Devin Dwyer,Supreme Court unanimously strikes down legal challenge to abortion pill mifepristone,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-unanimously-strikes-legal-challenge-abortion-pill/story?id=110439079,The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a legal challenge the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of the abortion pill mifepristone.,2024-06-13T14:07:03Z,"The ruling preserves access to the mail-order medication nationwide. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled a group of doctors lacked legal standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of the abortion pill mifepristone, preserving access to the medication nationwide. The unanimous opinion was authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The case put abortion access back in the spotlight for the court for the first time since its conservative majority voted to overrule Roe v. Wade in 2022.  ""Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others,"" Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. ""Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA's regulation of others."" ""Plaintiffs advance several complicated causation theories to connect FDA's actions to the plaintiffs' alleged injuries in fact,"" Kavanaugh added. ""None of these theories suffices to establish Article III standing."" Mifepristone is the first pill taken in a two-drug regimen for medication abortion, which is the most common method of abortion in the country. The court's ruling means mifepristone will remain available under preexisting conditions, which include allowing women to receive the medication by mail and without any in person dispensation requirement. But the Supreme Court did not address the doctors' claims the FDA erred in those regulations, which were enacted in 2016 and 2021. Instead, it leaves those questions to be resolved another time. Already, similar challenges against mifepristone are being brought by three Republican-led states: Missouri, Kansas and Idaho. Their attorneys claim they will fare better on legal standing.  Justice Kavanaugh suggested that while the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine ""failed to demonstrate that FDA's relaxed regulatory requirements likely would cause them to suffer an injury,"" there was another avenue for challenging the abortion pill. ""The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in the regulatory process,"" he wrote. Drug maker Danco, which fought to defend the pill, said the ruling was a huge win for the pharmaceutical industry which had warned against courts overriding the judgment of scientists and experts at FDA. The court ""maintained the stability of the FDA drug approval process, which is based on the agency's expertise and on which patients, healthcare providers and the US pharmaceutical industry rely,"" a Danco spokeswoman Abigail Long, said in a statement. Abortion opponents decried the decision as ""deeply disappointing."" ""It is a sad day for all who value women's health and unborn children's lives, but the fight to stop dangerous mail-order abortion drugs is not over,"" said Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America policy director Katie Daniel. Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley, who argued before the court on behalf of the doctors, also expressed dismay that the justices did not dive into the merits of the case. Hawley said the group ""will continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs.""  The Supreme Court did deliver a forceful endorsement of conscience protections for doctors who oppose abortion -- perhaps a sign of how it might rule in another major abortion case this term: Moyle v. U.S. That case focuses on Idaho's abortion ban and whether a federal law governing emergency care protects access to abortion at hospitals when a woman's health is at risk. The court appeared fractured on the issue when it heard arguments on April 24. A decision is expected by the end of June. ""Federal conscience laws definitively protect doctors from being required to perform abortions or to provide other treatment that violates their consciences,"" Kavanaugh wrote in Thursday's opinion. President Joe Biden said the court's mifepristone decision ""does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues."" ""Women are being turned away from emergency rooms, or forced to go to court to plead for care that their doctor recommended or to travel hundreds of miles for care,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Doctors and nurses are being threatened with jail time, including life in prison, for providing the health care they have been trained to provide. And contraception and IVF are under attack."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

G7 leaders on Thursday agreed to lend Ukraine $50 billion this year -- backed by profits from frozen Russian assets -- to help the country's war effort and rebuilding. This plan has been years in the making. It's a win for President Biden, who has been pushing allies to agree to the deal, amid hesitation from some European countries. The agreement will be formalized in the communique at the end of the summit. But there are still key details of the plan the countries need to work out. The US is willing to make a loan of up to $50 billion, though it's unclear exactly how much the U.S. will end up lending. Other counties will pitch in to share the risk. ""We're going to move with urgency,"" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.  ""Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond and this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap… This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world, that we're not going to fatigue and defending Ukraine's freedom and that Putin is not going to outlast us."" Officials said that while it will take time for the funds to be disbursed, they do expect the money to begin to be disbursed this calendar year. Funds will be used for military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support. When asked by reporters about the risks associated with the loans, the senior administration official said that it can be thought of as a""secured loan"" because of the interest that is generated from the Russian assets. The official added that there are scenarios in which the income stream ""may not flow,"" but noted that reparations could be a solution. ""How are we going to get repaid? Russia pays…the income comes from the interest stream on the immobilized asset,"" the official said. ""The principal is untouched for now, but we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there."" The official added that ""if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized. And keep generating interest to repay the loans or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment."" When I asked how the U.S. overcame pushback from some allies, the official said that the risks of this agreement outweighed the risk of Ukraine falling short on funding to counter Russia's offensive. ""What's the alternative? And if Ukraine was insufficiently financed, to win this war, what would be the chilling effect it would cause across Europe and the rest of the world? What would be the signal to autocrats that they can redraw borders by force? Those are the costs, I think we all agreed were unacceptable, and that's why we acted,"" the administration official said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Hall of Fame NBA player and executive Jerry West -- who won eight NBA titles as a member of the front office for the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors -- died Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Clippers. West, known as ""The Logo"" due to his silhouette being used as the NBA logo, was 86 years old. West, whose teams often came up short against Bill Russell and the Celtics in the '60s, finally won his only title as a player with the Lakers in 1972. Though his teams often came up short for the title, West won the NBA Finals MVP in 1969 -- the first award ever given -- despite losing the series. “Jerry West, the personification of basketball excellence and a friend to all who knew him, passed away peacefully this morning at the age of 86. His wife, Karen, was by his side,” the Clippers announced in a statement. West had been an executive with the Clippers since 2017. He made his name as an executive with the Los Angeles Lakers, though. He served as executive during the run of the Showtime Lakers, led by Magic Johnson, during the 1980s. The team won five championships during the decade (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988). ""Jerry’s four decades with the Lakers also included a successful stint as a head coach and a remarkable run in the front office that cemented his reputation as one of the greatest executives in sports history,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. ""He helped build eight championship teams during his tenure in the NBA – a legacy of achievement that mirrors his on-court excellence. And he will be enshrined this October into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor, becoming the first person ever inducted as both a player and a contributor.  Born in West Virginia in 1938, he also earned the nickname ""Zeke from Cabin Creek"" for his humble upbringing. He stayed home to attend West Virginia University, and led his squad to the NCAA title game in 1959. The team came up short against California, but West won the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player anyway -- a foreshadowing of his 1969 NBA Finals MVP. He also would lead Team USA, alongside fellow future Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, to the gold medal in the 1960 Rome Olympics. The 6-foot-3 combo guard was drafted No. 2 overall in the 1960 NBA draft -- behind Robertson -- by the then-Minneapolis Lakers. He was named to the All-Star Game in all 14 years he played in the league -- all for the Lakers -- and averaged 27 points, 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game over his career. He amped that up with 29.1 points per game in the playoffs over his career. He briefly served as Lakers head coach after his retirement as a player, but really found his calling in the front office. After building a dynasty in the '80s, he did it again in the '90s by drafting high schooler Kobe Bryant in 1996 and signing Shaquille O'Neal away from the Orlando Magic in the same season. He also served as an executive with the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors, West was portrayed by actor Jason Clarke in the recent HBO series ""Winning Time,"" about the 1980s Lakers. West took issue with his portrayal as someone who routinely lost his temper and unleashed strings of profanities. West asked for a retraction from producers at the time. ""The portrayal of NBA icon and L.A. Lakers legend Jerry West in 'Winning Time' is fiction pretending to be fact -- a deliberately false characterization that has caused great distress to Jerry and his family,"" Skip Miller, West's lawyer, said in April 2022. ""Contrary to the baseless portrayal in the HBO series, Jerry had nothing but love for and harmony with the Lakers organization, and in particular owner Dr. Jerry Buss, during an era in which he assembled one of the greatest teams in NBA history."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
70,G. Elliott Morris,Trump and Biden are tied in 538's new election forecast,https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-biden-tied-538s-new-election-forecast/story?id=110789256,"Trump has a slight edge in the polls, but the fundamentals favor Biden.",2024-06-11T12:55:48Z,"Trump has a slight edge in the polls, but the fundamentals favor Biden. Today 538 published our official forecast for the 2024 presidential election. The model builds on our general election polling averages by asking not just what our best guess is about who is leading the presidential race today, but what range of outcomes are possible for the actual election in November. At least once per day, we'll rerun our simulations of the election with the latest data, so bookmark our interactive and check back often. At launch, our forecast shows President Joe Biden locked in a practically tied race with former President Donald Trump, both in the Electoral College and national popular vote. Specifically, our model reckons Biden has a 53-in-100 chance of winning the election, meaning he wins in slightly more than half of our model's simulations of how the election could unfold. However, Trump still has a 47-in-100 chance, so this election could still very much go either way. The range of realistic* Electoral College outcomes generated by our forecasting model stretches from 132 to 445 electoral votes for Biden — a testament to how much things could change by November (and how off the polls could be). Our model is brand new this year, with tons of bells and whistles and modern statistical tools that you can read all about in our methodology post. Here, I'll give you the non-wonky version of how the forecast works, offer a few tips on how to read it and explain why we think forecasts are valuable in the first place. To forecast the election, we rely primarily on polls asking voters whom they support. However, our forecast also incorporates various economic and political indicators that aren’t related to polling but can be used to make rough predictions for the election. For example, we have calculated an index of economic growth and optimism on every day since 1944, gathered historical approval ratings for every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt and derived a formula for predicting state election outcomes using these and other local factors. We also tested whether incumbent presidents do better when they run for reelection (they do) and whether all of these factors are less predictive of voters’ choices when political polarization is high (they are). Right now, Trump leads Biden in most polls of the swing states that will decide the election, but the “fundamentals” favor Biden. The combined polls-plus-fundamentals forecast splits the difference between these two viewpoints and arrives at an essentially deadlocked race. Here’s what it looks like on the state level: At this point in the race, our margin of error for these state forecasts is huge. There are two reasons for this: First, it is early. As pollsters are bound to remind you many times between now and November, polls are snapshots of public opinion as it stands today, not predictions of vote share in the eventual election. To the extent they are predictions at all, they predict how people would vote if an election were held today — which, of course, it will not be. In part, this oft-repeated caveat is a convenient way for pollsters to avoid catching flak for inaccurate numbers closer to the election. But there is an important truth to it: If a voter has not yet cast their ballot, there is the possibility they may change their mind. We also don't know exactly who is going to turn out in this election yet. All this means polls earlier in the election cycle are worse at approximating the final margin. This is where forecasting models really become useful. Above everything else, 538 makes forecasts to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the election. Our study of historical presidential election polls finds that the margin between the two candidates shifts by an average of 9 percentage points between June and November. In practical terms, that means today's polls have a true margin of error of close to 20 points. And while recent elections have not had as much volatility, we can't assume 2024 will be the same way; it's possible that this year will be closer to the historical norm. The second major source of error is the chance that polls systematically underestimate one of the candidates, as happened in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. We estimate that, even on Election Day, state-level polling averages of presidential general elections have an expected error of 4 points on the margin — meaning if the candidates are tied in the polling average, then on average we'd expect one to win by 4, and in rare cases they could win by 8! Having such wide margins of error is not our way of absolving ourselves of responsibility if the election result is surprising. It's our way of giving you, the reader, a more informed understanding of the range of potential election outcomes than you'd get from a single poll (or even a polling average). Over the last decade, it has become common to view election forecasting — and even polling — as purely making predictions of ""what will happen"" in the election. But we think forecasting models serve a greater journalistic purpose than a focus on prediction gives them credit for. For us here at 538, forecasting is an exercise in quantifying the reliability of various indicators of public opinion. Yes, that involves making predictions, but the real value of our work is the statistical analysis of the reliability of the numbers you are bound to see plastered all over print news media, social media and television over the next five months. We think this is a different goal from making predictions for prediction's sake, or making a model that can ""call"" every state correctly. If you want someone to give you a prediction of who will win the election with absolute certainty, then look elsewhere. (And buyer beware.) Instead, we think we offer a unique product that can help you be smarter about the way you think about the range of outcomes for the election. As the stakes of our politics increase, a carefully calibrated sense of what could realistically happen in November — in our case, from a forecast that properly distinguishes between normal and tail risk — becomes increasingly valuable. On that note, I'll end with a few tips on how to read our forecast responsibly: Watch the distributions. Our model simulates thousands of possible Electoral College outcomes based on the historical predictive error of the indicators we rely on. The top of our forecast page has a histogram of a random subset of these simulations, showing you which outcomes are likelier than others. We hope you get the impression that there is a wide potential range of outcomes, given all the error we're talking about. Unlikely does not mean impossible. In 2020, polls performed worse than in any election since 1980. The average state-level poll conducted in the last three weeks of that election overestimated Biden's vote margin by 4.6 points — about 1.5 times the average 3-point bias for presidential elections since 1972. In a backtest of our current model, we would have assigned about a 20 percent chance to Biden winning 306 electoral votes (the number he actually won) or fewer in 2020. We think a similar miss this year would be statistically surprising, but a possibility people should mentally prepare for. Changes in public opinion take time. We have done our best to make a model that reacts the appropriate amount to new polling data. ""Appropriate"" here means that the model will be conservative early on or when polls are bouncing generally around the same level, but also that it will be aggressive when polls appear to be moving uniformly across states — especially late in the campaign. However, as a properly Bayesian statistical model, the program that runs our forecast generates some amount of uncertainty about the parameters, resulting in unavoidable random error across our simulations. This means polling averages can change by a few decimal places day to day — and probabilities may jitter by around a point, which cascades down into uncertainty in our model. Don't sweat these small changes; instead, pay attention to bigger changes in the model over longer stretches of time. Use all the information you (reasonably) can. Polls are reasonably good predictors of election outcomes. In fact, asking people how they are going to vote is about the best single source of information you can get if your goal is to figure out how people might vote. But polls are not the only source of information available to us. 538's forecast incorporates demographics, polls and the ""fundamentals"" all the way up to Election Day; our research has found this decreases the chance for uniform bias in our forecast. Our forecast assumes normal election rules still apply. This is an important disclaimer about what our model is intended to do and what it is not. Because our model is trained on historical polling and election results, it is not intended to account for violations of normal political and election rules. We assume, for example, that if a voter legally casts a ballot, it will be counted accurately and fairly; that the electors a state elects to vote for a certain candidate in the Electoral College get to do so; that their votes are ultimately recognized by Congress; and that, as an extreme example, the election is administered on time, where officials say it will be administered and generally that people who show up to vote will be able to. That is not to say that we dismiss the possibility of rule-breaking. From an editorial perspective, we stand ready to cover any attempts to undermine a free and fair election. But as a quantitative matter, our forecast is intended to explain variance in election outcomes based on the polls and other indicators, to serve as a supplement to polling averages and to put other political journalism in its proper context. *Within the 95 percent confidence interval. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A man was driving with his four dogs on a remote U.S. Forest Service road on June 2 when he crashed into a ravine below, the Baker County Sheriff's Office said in a news release on Facebook. One of the dogs traveled nearly four miles to the campsite where the man was staying with family, which alerted them that something was wrong, the release said. His family located his car the following day and called 911 as they couldn't reach it in the steep terrain. When authorities arrived, they found the man about 100 yards (91 meters) from the car after they heard him yell for help. He had been able to crawl out of the car after the crash, the release said. U.S. Forest Service employees used chainsaws to clear a path through the vegetation for search and rescue teams, who set up a complex rope system spanning from one side of the ravine to the other. Once they were able to reach the man, authorities put him in a rescue stretcher and hooked it onto the ropes, which were then used as a pulley system to transport him to the other side of the ravine as a stream raged below, photos shared by the sheriff's office showed. The man was airlifted to a regional hospital, authorities said. His three other dogs were found alive at the scene of the crash. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

""not let this opportunity to pass by."" The United Nations Security Council on Monday afternoon adopted a U.S. draft resolution urging Hamas to accept the latest cease-fire and hostage release proposed deal. Fourteen members of the council voted in favor of the measure and only one -- Russia -- elected to abstain. Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council with veto power over resolutions. Nate Evans, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, noted in a statement ahead of the vote that the plan would enable a pause in fighting, the freeing of a number of hostages and an immediate surge in humanitarian assistance, among other things. ""Israel has accepted this proposal and the Security Council has an opportunity to speak with one voice and call on Hamas to do the same,"" his statement continued. ""Doing so would help save lives and the suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as the hostages and their families. Council Members should not let this opportunity to pass by and must speak with one voice in support of this deal.""  U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made a similar case just before the vote, saying that every day the war goes on, ""needless suffering continues."" ""Colleagues, after eight months of devastation and pain and trauma, what is needed now more than ever is for the fighting to end in a sustainable way,"" she said. ""The United States and every single country in this chamber wants to see an immediate cease-fire with the release of hostages. We've heard those calls time and time again since Oct. 7. Now the opportunity is here. We must seize it."" Hamas released a statement following the vote saying they ""welcome"" what was included in the draft resolution ""regarding a permanent cease-fire in Gaza."" President Joe Biden backed the proposal in late May, announcing Israel had degraded Hamas' capabilities and it was ""time for this war to end"" and the ""day after to begin."" Biden also outlined the plan's three phases, the first lasting for six weeks and consisting of a cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, the release of a number of hostages and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase would usher in a ""cessation of hostilities permanently,"" Biden said, should Hamas abide by the commitments laid out in the agreement, as well as the release of all remaining living hostages. The last phase would include a reconstruction of Gaza and the return of remains of hostages to their families.  The State Department said it was consulting with Israel on the U.N. draft resolution last week, even though Israel is not a member of the council. The vote comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East to further negotiate the cease-fire and hostage agreement. As he departed Cairo earlier Monday for Tel Aviv, Blinken called it a ""critical moment."" ""My message to governments throughout the region, to people throughout the region: If you want a cease-fire, press Hamas to say yes,"" Blinken told reporters. ""If you want to alleviate the terrible suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, press Hamas to say yes. ""If you want to get all the hostages home, press Hamas to say yes,"" he continued.

75,Mary Kekatos,Oklahoma girl becomes 1st child to undergo robotic deep brain stimulation,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/oklahoma-girl-1st-pediatric-patient-undergo-robotic-deep/story?id=111050121,"Karleigh Fry, 8, became the first pediatric patient in the world to undergo robotic deep brain stimulation to treat a neurological condition.",2024-06-12T19:52:56Z,"Karleigh Fry, 8, underwent the procedure to help treat a neurological disorder. An Oklahoma girl has become the first pediatric patient in the world to have robotic deep brain stimulation performed on her, two hospitals have announced. The patient, 8-year-old Karliegh Fry, suffers from rapid-onset primary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions. Karleigh's condition initially left her paralyzed, unable to walk, eat or sit up on her own. She was put on several medications, which improved her condition slightly, but she was also left at times with involuntary movements that caused her to injure herself.  A joint team at Oklahoma Children's Hospital OU Health and Bethany Children's Health Center began exploring options and decided she might be a good candidate for deep brain stimulation (DBS). ""This marked the global debut of using a robot from our operating rooms to perform DBS in a child, setting a precedent not only in Oklahoma but also across the United States and worldwide,"" Dr. Andrew Jea, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Oklahoma Children's Hospital, said in a press release. Deep brain stimulation is a procedure in which a surgeon implants one or more small wires knows as electrodes, or leads, in the brain. The electrodes are connected to a small device called a neurostimulator implanted in the upper chest. It is used in the treatment of neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and Tourette's syndrome. These conditions are caused by disorganized electrical signals in the parts of the brain that control movement, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. DBS works by interrupting the irregular signals that causes tremors or other involuntary movements. It does not cure these conditions but can improve a patient's quality of life. Using a robot to perform the procedure enhances ""surgical precision and safety,"" according to OU Health.  ""So it was like trying to decide if we thought that the surgery would be worth the risk ... but I think anything to give her her best shot,"" Karleigh's mother, Trisha Fry, said in an interview with OU Health. Karleigh's surgery was split into two separate parts, according to her mother. The surgery was performed at Oklahoma Children's Hospital and Karleigh was transferred to Bethany Children's Health Center for post-operative care and pediatric rehabilitation. Within a few minutes of the neurostimulator being activated, OU Health said Karleigh was able to lower and relax her arms, which she couldn't do prior to the procedure.

President Lazarus Chakwera announced 21 days of national mourning on Tuesday, when the wreckage of the small military plane carrying Chilima and a former first lady was discovered in a mountainous area in the country's north. Chilima was 51 and had been vice president since 2014, having served a first term in the role under former President Peter Mutharika. Chakwera previously said there were 10 people on the plane, but the government now says nine were on board. Everyone was killed on impact when the twin-propeller aircraft went down in a hilly, forested area in bad weather, the president said. The victims included former first lady Shanil Dzimbiri, the ex-wife of former Malawian President Bakili Muluzi. Six passengers and three military crew members were on board. The plane was on a short flight from the capital, Lilongwe, to the northern city of Mzuzu for a funeral of a former government minister when it went missing Monday morning. The president said air traffic controllers had told the plane not to land in Mzuzu because of bad weather and poor visibility and to return to Lilongwe. Air traffic controllers then lost contact with the plane and it disappeared from radar. Hundreds of soldiers, police officers and forest rangers searched for more than 24 hours before the wreckage was discovered in a forest plantation south of Mzuzu. The remains of the victims were brought back to Lilongwe on a Zambian Air Force helicopter on Tuesday night. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
78,Tal Axelrod,Hunter Biden conviction likely to have muted impact on election: Experts,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hunter-biden-conviction-muted-impact-election-experts/story?id=111025843,Hunter Biden's conviction Tuesday on three charges marks a historic moment -- but it may not significantly change the contours of the presidential race.,2024-06-12T09:10:19Z,"""I don't think the verdict will materially impact the race,"" a Republican said. Hunter Biden's conviction Tuesday on three felony charges marks a historic moment -- the first time a sitting president's child has been found guilty of felonies. The verdict's impact on the presidential race, however, may not match that moment. Operatives in both parties predicted that the conviction would do little to move the needle in an election featuring two universally known candidates whose own poll numbers have refused to budge more than a few points even in light of historic developments surrounding President Joe Biden and Donald Trump themselves -- including the former president's own felony conviction last month. ""Considering how little the Trump verdict seemed to move the needle, I'm not sure Hunter's will do anything either,"" GOP pollster Robert Blizzard said of Hunter Biden's conviction on three charges related to the purchase of a firearm while he was allegedly addicted to crack cocaine.  Hunter Biden, the president's only living son, has been a target of Republican politics for years, with the GOP insisting he looped his father into years of his business dealings -- claims the White House has repeatedly denied. Joe Biden and Democrats, for their part, have sought to cast Republican talking points as conspiracy theories while the administration has emphasized the president's support for his son and his recovery from addiction. The messaging on each side is not anticipated to stop anytime soon, especially in a cycle where Republicans' claims of a ""rigged"" justice system are a mainstay of today's campaign rhetoric. However, it's unclear how much Hunter Biden's conviction moves the race forward rather than keeps it where it is. ""I don't think the verdict will materially impact the race,"" said Republican strategist Rob Stutzman. ""It does mute GOP claims that the Biden DOJ is weaponized against Trump and MAGA, but the election isn't turning on that question.""  To be certain, Republicans still seized on the verdict as a bad look for the president that could impede his messaging. Dave Carney, a veteran GOP strategist recently tapped to lead a new pro-Trump super PAC, said the ruling could have ""some"" impact on the race but also cut into new attacks from the Biden campaign against Trump's convictions. ""It takes the 'convicted felon' issue off the table for Biden. Their toolbox is looking bleaker,"" he said, referencing a newly common phrase in statements from the president's camp. Others touted vindication on Hunter Biden's infamous laptop, a device introduced into evidence that was allegedly left with a Wilmington, Delaware, computer repairman. Republicans had claimed the computer included personal details, while Democrats dismissed that messaging as a conspiracy theory – an assertion that GOP strategist Scott Jennings said could rub voters the wrong way after the laptop was essentially validated by being introduced as evidence. ""I do think Biden's ability to recover is going to be based somewhat on whether people find him to be credible,"" he added. ""Do they think he's telling them the truth? Do they believe it when he says things to them about himself or about Donald Trump? And now, one of the problems is they know full well he lied right to their face about this laptop."" Democrats swatted away any claims that voters would negatively link the president to Tuesday's verdict.  While Republicans have been railing against Hunter Biden's business dealings for years, strategists estimated that undecided voters would not be swayed by the conviction amid concerns over other issues, including Trump's own legal hurdles. ""I don't think Hunter Biden matters to folks much at all except for extreme Trumpers who will say 'see!' But their candidate got convicted, not one of his kids. That's a voting issue. The Trump verdict I think could force some lean conservative people to stay home. No poll can measure that. No one is staying home because of Hunter,"" said Democratic strategist Peter Giangreco, who worked on former President Barack Obama's campaigns. Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said ""voters know that there's only one candidate for president who thinks he's above the law and is convicted of 34 felonies for fraud."" Hunter Biden's conviction also echoes struggles of millions of families across the country who have a loved one battling addiction, with Democrats suggesting the verdict may be both difficult to attack on the trail and relatable to everyday Americans. ""On one hand, it reminds us that President Biden's lived experience is more like the majority of Americans than Trump's. Millions of American families deal with addiction, the impact of addiction and the journey of recovery,"" said Democratic strategist Karen Finney, a veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Biden fundraiser John Morgan said ""only a person with no heart would not be sympathetic"" to the story of addiction and recovery. ""And [Biden] isn't saying the trial is rigged. The contrast between the two trials will be a huge boost for the president,"" Morgan added. Joe Biden for his part largely sought to avoid any political commentary on the verdict, releasing a personal statement only from the White House and not from his campaign. ""As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,"" the president said in a statement. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

President Joe Biden touted on Thursday several new major U.S. commitments for Ukraine that were announced this week, including a 10-year bilateral security agreement, sanctions to disrupt Russia's war machine, and a sign-off from the G7 on a $50 billion loan backed by frozen Russian assets. Biden, in during a press conference in Italy with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the collective efforts by the G7 show that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot wait us out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail this war.""  On the bilateral agreement, Biden said the goal is to ""strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term."" He reiterated his position that American troops will not fight in Ukraine, but the United States would provide them with weapons. Zelenskyy called it a ""historic day"" after signing the ""strongest agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. since our independence."" ""This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation, and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace. And therefore, it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global threat,"" Zelenskyy said.  Zelenskyy was asked what his contingency plan is if the next U.S. president does not follow through with this agreement, but he suggested that as long as Americans support Ukraine, so will the American president.  ""If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,"" he said.  Highlighting the frozen Russian assets, Biden said the plan that's been agreed to by the G7 is another reminder for Putin that ""we’re not backing down."" ""Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions and will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success,"" Biden said. After Biden recently signed off on Ukraine using American weapons to strike in parts of Russia, limiting use to areas near the Russian-occupied Kharkiv region, he was asked if he would consider expanding those parameters to allow for longer-range strikes; he said his policy is still against that.  ""It makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border. In terms of long, long-range weapons, longer-range weapons into the interior of Russia, we have not changed our position on that sort,"" he said. Zelenskyy was asked about how long the supplemental support from the U.S. and other nations will get him on the battlefield. He said it's not a matter of how long the aid lasts, but, more importantly, how long unity among nations will last.  ""I think the question has to be, for how long the unity will last? The unity in the United States, together with the European leaders -- how these or those elections will influence this unity?"" Zelensky said, via translation ""It seems to me that we should look on this exactly this way: to preserve unity, to preserve the integrity of the world, the integrity of the democratic world. Because if Ukraine does not withstand, the democracy, many countries will not be able to withstand, and I am sure of that,"" he added. For his part, Biden pledged that Ukraine will ""have what they need."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
80,"Dr. Michelle March, Dr. Sejal Parekh","43% of US households are not storing guns securely, study says",https://abcnews.go.com/Health/new-study-shows-43-us-households-storing-guns/story?id=111100488,A new study shows nearly half of U.S. households aren't storing guns securely.,2024-06-13T21:14:18Z,"Here are some secure storage tips that can help save lives. Firearms are the leading cause of death in the United States for children aged 0-19 years, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting over 4,700 pediatric gun-related deaths in 2021. Many of those deaths are unintentional. A new study published by the CDC described how often guns are stored in different U.S. states. Up to 43% of households store loaded guns, which is not considered safe, while half of the households that store guns loaded with ammunition do not put them in locked containers, according to the study. Loaded guns that are not locked can be easy for children to find and accidentally fire. Households from eight states were surveyed for this high-quality report; including Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma. The percentage of households who had guns and stored guns securely varied widely between states. North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Nevada had the highest rates of households storing loaded guns, the report said. Pediatricians and advocates say one simple strategy could dramatically reduce the number of children who are killed: Secure firearm storage. This means storing a firearm locked, unloaded and with the ammunition stored separately from the firearm. Though it sounds simple, there are a range of options for storing your gun securely at home.  Options include cable locks, lock boxes, trigger locks and gun safes. Most can be found for purchase on large retail websites, such as Amazon, or through stores like The Home Depot or Dick's Sporting Goods. ""It really comes down to what does the family want or need,"" Dr. Sandra McKay, an associate professor of pediatrics at UTHealth Houston and nonresident fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, told ABC News. The bottom line is too many children are in harm's way, according to McKay. This sentiment was also shared by Dr. Eric Sigel, a pediatrician, adolescent medicine specialist, and co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Firearm Injury Prevention Special Interest Group who highlighted a recent study estimating that 1 in 3 middle and high schoolers have access to a firearm. Through statistical modeling, another study calculated that if 20% of parents changed their current storage practices to storing firearms unloaded and with the ammunition locked away separately ""there would be an estimated decrease of up to 122 pediatric firearm-related fatalities and 201 injuries annually."" Four common types of secure storage devices include: Like a bike lock, but for a firearm. A cable lock is a flexible cable that loops through an empty firearm, making it impossible to load or fire. These range in price from $5-50 and are oftentimes available for free through both local and national community organizations. Smaller, portable versions of a gun safe. A lock box is made of metal or durable plastic. It has a lock on it to keep it shut. They are perfect for storing a single gun to make sure it's secure but available for quick access. They cost between $25-$350. Trigger locks fit over the trigger mechanism of a firearm to keep it from being pulled. They are small and compatible with most firearms, but not as safe as other options because a firearm can still be loaded with a trigger lock in place. And, if not put on correctly, a loaded firearm may accidentally fire. These cost between $10-$50. Large, heavy safes that can store multiple guns, including rifles and shotguns. Made of tough metal, they have electronic or mechanical locks. Gun safes are one of the most secure places to store guns, but they are also the most expensive starting at $500. ""There are a lot of different places that families can go to learn about these various devices. I think one of the secret gems out there are going to your [Gun] Range Safety Officers,"" said McKay. Other resources include Hunter Safety Training, gun shops, and local law enforcement agencies. Outside of the home, McKay and Sigel encourage parents to discuss secure firearm storage with healthcare providers, family members, friends, and neighbors. McKay recommends using neutral language that emphasizes child safety, similar to how one would address food allergies, pool access and pets.

Wade told WJTV-TV that the suspect, a 32-year-old woman, is an acquaintance of a 36-year-old man who was captured Thursday.  The woman was arrested at a hotel in South Jackson as a result of a collaborative effort between multiple law enforcement agencies, the chief said. She was transferred to the Hinds County Detention Center in Raymond.  According to Wade, the 4-year-old was found dead in a wooded area, while her 6-year-old sister was found alive nearby and taken to a Jackson hospital.  Wade said there was evidence of possible human trafficking where the children were found, including small animal cages, and Jackson police have contacted the Human Trafficking Divisions of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Hinds County to assess the scene.  The first person arrested, a Louisiana native who had dated the girls' mother, was the suspect in an Amber Alert in Louisiana before he was arrested. Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey said he was being held in the Rankin County Jail.  Louisiana State Police issued the alert after the girls' mother, Callie Brunett, 35, was found dead in her home in Loranger, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of Baton Rouge. She was reported missing after no one had spoken with her since Tuesday, according to Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Chief Deputy Jimmy Travis.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory. Putin’s remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world leaders -- but not from Moscow -- this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine. They also coincided with a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Italy and after the U.S. and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as “null and void.” Putin blasted the Switzerland conference as “just another ploy to divert everyone’s attention, reverse the cause and effect of the Ukrainian crisis (and) set the discussion on the wrong track.” His demands came in a speech at the Russian Foreign Ministry and was aimed at what he called a “final resolution” of the conflict rather than “freezing it,” and stressed the Kremlin is “ready to start negotiations without delay.” Broader demands for peace that Putin listed included Ukraine’s recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, keeping the country’s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population. All of these should be part of “fundamental international agreements,” and all Western sanctions against Russia should be lifted, Putin said. “We’re urging to turn this tragic page of history and to begin restoring, step-by-step, the unity between Russia and Ukraine and in Europe in general,” he said. Putin’s remarks, made to a group of somber Foreign Ministry officials and some senior lawmakers, represented a rare occasion in which he clearly laid out his conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, but it didn’t include any new demands. The Kremlin has said before that Kyiv should recognize its territorial gains and drop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in Italy for the G7 meeting, said Putin's proposal was not new and was in the form of an “ultimatum,” comparing it to actions by Adolf Hitler in seizing territory that led to World War II. “What Putin demands is to give them a part of our territories, those occupied and not occupied, talking about several regions of our country,” he said. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry called Putin’s plan “manipulative,” “absurd” and designed to “mislead the international community, undermine diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a just peace, and split the unity of the world majority around the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.” Besides seeking to join NATO, Ukraine wants Russian forces out of its territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was illegally annexed in 2014; the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity; and that Russia be held accountable for war crimes and for Moscow to pay reparations to Kyiv. Russia launched its a full-scale invasion in February 2022. After Ukrainian forces thwarted a Russian drive to the capital, much of the fighting has focused in the south and east, where Moscow illegally annexed four regions, although it doesn’t fully control any of them. Zelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on social media there was nothing new from Putin and that the Russian leader “voiced only the ‘standard aggressor’s set,’ which has been heard many times already.” “There is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It’s all a complete sham,” Podolyak wrote on X. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that Putin “has illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory. He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace.” Austin added that Putin “started this war with no provocation. He could end it today if he chose to do that.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg added that “this is not a peace proposal. This is a proposal of more aggression, more occupation, and it demonstrates in a way that that Russia’s aim is to control Ukraine.” Putin insisted that Kyiv should withdraw from all four annexed regions entirely and essentially cede them to Moscow within their administrative borders. In Zaporizhzhia in the southeast, Russia still doesn’t control the region’s administrative capital with a pre-war population of about 700,000; in the neighboring Kherson region, Moscow withdrew from its biggest city and capital of the same name in November 2022. Putin said if “Kyiv and Western capitals” reject his offer, “it is their business, their political and moral responsibility for continuing the bloodshed.” The Kremlin has repeatedly aired its readiness for peace talks with Kyiv and blamed the West for undermining its efforts to end the conflict. Putin went further Friday and claimed his troops never intended to storm Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, even though they approached the city. “In essence, it was nothing other than an operation to force the Ukrainian regime to peace. The troops were there to push the Ukrainian side to negotiate, to try and find an acceptable solution,” he said. Moscow withdrew from Kyiv in March 2022 and described it a goodwill gesture as peace talks between the two began, but the pullback took place amid fierce Ukrainian resistance that significantly slowed down Russia’s battlefield advances. Putin also claimed that in that same month, he told a foreign official he wasn’t ruling out withdrawing forces from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and ceding occupied parts of them back to Ukraine, as long as Kyiv allowed Russia to have a “strong land connection” to Crimea. He said the official planned on bringing that proposal to Kyiv — which Moscow “welcomed,” as it generally welcomed “attempts to find a peaceful resolution of the conflict.” But the Kremlin then annexed both regions, along with the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, citing the results of sham “referendums” it staged there. Putin mentioned those and said, “The matter is closed forever and is no longer up for discussion.” In Friday’s fighting, Russian defenses shot down 87 Ukrainian drones, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said, most of them launched against the Rostov region, home to Russia’s southern military command, but no deaths or damage were reported in one of the biggest Ukrainian drone barrages of the war. In Russia’s Belgorod region on the border, part of a residential building collapsed in the town of Shebekino after Ukrainian shelling, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Three people were injured, he said. Ukraine’s military has been on the back foot in recent months, with its troops outnumbered by the Kremlin’s forces and running short of ammunition and weaponry due to delays in promised Western military aid. Russia has battered Ukraine with drones, especially its power grid. It fired 14 missiles and 17 Shahed drones overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Air defense systems downed all the drones as well as seven missiles, it said. The attacks injured six people in the Donetsk region, where residential buildings were hit, officials said. A Russian drone struck a bus near the village of Esman in the northern Sumy region, injuring three women. Authorities say 20 passengers were in the bus at the time. Also Friday, Russia returned to Ukraine the bodies of 254 of its soldiers, Kyiv said. Once identified, the bodies will be returned to relatives, according to Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War —- Associated Press writers Jim Heintz in Tallinn, Samya Kullab and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Barry Hatton in Lisbon, Portugal, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Former President Donald Trump's comments reportedly calling Milwaukee a ""horrible city"" continue to spark debate as Republicans and Trump's campaign dispute the characterization of his comments, and Democrats persistently amplify his words -- including through a new billboard campaign in the city. ﻿In his closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Thursday, Trump called Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National Convention next month, a ""horrible city,"" sources told ABC News. The comments, first reported by Punchbowl News, attacked Milwaukee -- a major city in a key battleground state in the 2024 election where both Trump and President Joe Biden are working to woo voters.  Trump clarified his comments in an interview with WITI-TV, the Milwaukee Fox News station, on Thursday. ""It was very clear what I meant. I said, we're very concerned with crime,"" Trump said. ""I love Milwaukee, I have great friends in Milwaukee. The crime numbers are terrible and we have to be very careful."" Trump's campaign spokesperson also punched back on the reports, arguing that Trump's words were taken out of context. ""He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are,"" said campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung. In another statement, the campaign wrote that it was a ""total lie"" that Trump called Milwaukee a ""horrible city."" However, they went on to add, ""President Trump was explicitly referring to the problems in Milwaukee, specifically violent crime and voter fraud,"" suggesting he did make comments about the city, just not in the way some were interpreting it. The campaign then includes a series of tweets from Republican members from Wisconsin inside the room who agree with the campaign's description that Trump was not making a blanket disparaging statement about the city. Republicans -- including those from Wisconsin -- quickly jumped to Trump's defense, insisting the former president was talking about crime and election security. ""@realdonaldtrump was specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee,"" Rep. Derrick Van Orden posted on X after the meeting. Rep. Glenn Grothman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump ""was concerned about the election"" and ""felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country."" Rep. Bryan Steil claimed on X that Trump ""did not say this"" in the conference meeting. ""There is no better place than Wisconsin in July,"" Steil said.  The front page of Friday's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel featured Trump's words front and center: ""Trump: Milwaukee 'horrible.'"" Biden's campaign and other Democrats are also teeing off on Trump's comments. Biden's campaign is starting to sell merchandise, including stickers and T-shirts that read ""(NOT) a horrible city"" on top of the Wisconsin state outline as well as ""I love Milwaukee"" T-shirts where the heart is replaced with beer, an homage to the many breweries around the state. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced that the group has paid to put up billboards around Milwaukee with Trump's reported comments criticizing the city. The billboards, which will launch in 10 different locations across the city, feature the quote that Trump is reported to have said during Thursday's closed-door House Republican meeting: ""Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city."" In a post on X, Biden responded to Trump's comments with a photo of him with the Milwaukee Bucks after they won the 2021 NBA Championship. ""I happen to love Milwaukee."" Trump's rivals are accusing him of abandoning the pivotal swing state -- including Wisconsin's Democrats. ""If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city,"" Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign Manager Garren Randolph said in a statement. ""Milwaukee -- our state's largest and most diverse city and home to more than 577,000 people, the Bucks and Brewers, and the country's best beer -- deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values."" Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign event in Racine, Wisconsin -- 30 miles south of Milwaukee -- next Tuesday, where he will focus his remarks on inflation and immigration. In just over a month, Trump will return to Milwaukee to accept the Republican nomination at the party's convention. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
85,The Associated Press,US cricket team advances to second round in Twenty20 World Cup debut,https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/us-cricket-team-advances-round-twenty20-world-cup-111135764,The United States cricket team has made more history by qualifying for the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out in Florida,2024-06-14T19:18:26Z,"The United States cricket team has made more history by qualifying for the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out in Florida LAUDERHILL, Fla. -- The United States cricket team made more history by reaching the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out on Friday. Rain meant the match at Broward County Stadium was abandoned without a ball bowled, advancing the Americans to the Super Eight stage and automatically qualifying them for the 2026 Twenty20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. South Africa beat Nepal by one run and New Zealand defeated Uganda by nine wickets in later matches Friday. The U.S. qualified for this T20 World Cup only as a co-host with the West Indies, but it has used home advantage to make a stunning first impression in its first major cricket tournament. While the Americans progressed alongside unbeaten India from Group A, former champion Pakistan and winless Ireland were eliminated from Super Eight contention. Pakistan won the title in 2009 and reached two more finals, including at the last T20 World Cup in 2022. Pakistan has failed to get out of the group stage for the first time. Ireland was expected to be a threat, too. The Irish also reached the second round on debut in 2009 and repeated in 2022. The competition point from the washout was enough for the U.S. to advance after beating Canada in Texas and stunning Pakistan in Texas during the first week. Tying Pakistan in regular overs then beating it in a super over was one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history. The Americans were thumped by India, one of the title favorites, as expected on Wednesday but the hosts' progression without being able to play on Friday was still well deserved. The umpires made four inspections of the wet outfield before heavy rain arrived at around 1:30 p.m. local time and the match was called off three hours after its scheduled start. The 17th-ranked U.S. joined the West Indies, India, Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan in the Super Eight, with two more teams yet to qualify.  Nepal has come within a whisker of achieving its best-ever win in cricket, losing by one run to powerhouse South Africa at Kingstown, St. Vincent in the Caribbean. Nepal needed two runs from the last ball of the match to win, one run to match South Africa’s modest total of 115-7 and force a Super Over. But teenager Ghulsan Jha was run out at the non-striker’s end attempting a single from the final ball and South Africa held on to win a thrilling match. The Nepal players were disconsolate. They seemed to be headed for Nepal’s first win in 12 attempts against a ICC full member nation when they needed 22 runs from the last 24 balls. They needed 18 runs from 18 balls but lost three wickets for one run within six balls including two wickets to Tabraiz Shamsi and the equation changed. Gulshan was unable to score from the first two balls of the last over, bowled by Ottneil Baartman. He then slashed a four through the off side and Nepal needed four runs from three balls. Gulshan ran two with Sompal Kami and Nepal needed 2 from two balls. The fifth ball was a dot ball — no runs were scored — and Gulshan was run out next ball to end the match. “We were very close and yet so far,” Nepal captain Rohit Paudel said. “I think in crunch moments we did well and the way we fought was very good. If we can play top teams more regularly then next time we will be on the winning side."" Tim Southee took three wickets for four runs as New Zealand achieved its first win in Group C, bowling out Uganda for 40 in 18.2 overs and reaching that target with nine wickets to spare. Southee and his long-time bowling partner Trent Boult who took two wickets for seven runs, and Rachin Ravindra with 2-9 combined to bowl out Uganda for the third lowest total at a T20 World Cup. Uganda was bowled out for 39 by the West Indies earlier in the tournament and shares that record with the Netherlands who made 39 against Sri Lanka in 2014. New Zealand had no chance of reaching the Super Eight stage after losing its first two matches to Afghanistan and the West Indies. Those two teams have secured the Super Eight qualifying spots from Group C. “It was obviously a pretty clinical performance and nice to get a win,” Southee said. “We're extremely disappointed to have played ourselves out of the tournament.” ___ AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
86,JENNIFER PELTZ Associated Press,Dogs' digs at the Garden: Westminster show returning to Madison Square Garden next year,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/dogs-digs-garden-westminster-show-returning-madison-square-111139190,Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs,2024-06-14T22:04:38Z,"Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs NEW YORK -- Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs. The Westminster Kennel Club announced this week that its storied dog show is returning next year to the Manhattan arena for the first time since 2020. That year's show was held weeks before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and shutdowns began in New York City and across the United States. For various reasons, the annual canine contest has since been held at an estate in suburban Westchester and at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. But organizers have wanted to return to Manhattan and to the so-called World's Most Famous Arena, the dog show's home for nearly all of the event's 148 years.  The 2025 show will begin with an agility competition Feb. 8 at the sprawling Javits Center convention venue, a few blocks from Madison Square Garden. The traditional breed-by-breed contest that leads to the best in show trophy will unfold on Feb. 10 and 11, with preliminary-round judging at the Javits Center during daytime hours and the semifinals and finals at night at the Garden.  “As Westminster approaches its 150th anniversary in 2026, we could not be more excited to welcome our celebration of the world’s top canines, as well as our incredible fan base, back to this global stage,” club President Donald Sturz said in a statement. About 3,000 canines compete in the various events at Westminster, which is considered the most prestigious U.S. dog show.  This year's winner was a miniature poodle named Sage, while a border collie-papillion mix called Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
87,DAVID KOENIG AP airlines writer,"A Southwest Airlines plane that did a 'Dutch roll' suffered structural damage, investigators say",https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/southwest-airlines-plane-dutch-roll-suffered-structural-damage-111139753,Investigators say a Southwest Airlines plane suffered damage to parts of the structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a flight last month,2024-06-14T22:22:15Z,"Investigators say a Southwest Airlines plane suffered damage to parts of the structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a flight last month A Boeing 737 Max suffered damage to parts of the plane's structure after it went into a “Dutch roll” during a Southwest Airlines flight last month, U.S. investigators said Friday.  The incident happened as the jet cruised at 34,000 feet from Phoenix to Oakland, California, on May 25, but Southwest did not notify the National Transportation Safety Board about the roll or damage to the jetliner until June 7, the NTSB said. “Following the event, SWA performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components,” the safety board said. The NTSB comment could suggest that the incident was more serious than previously known, but aviation experts said it was too soon to know for sure. A Southwest spokesperson said the Dallas-based airline is participating in the investigation. He declined further comment. A Dutch roll is a combination of yaw, or the tail sliding side to side, and the plane rocking in a way that causes the wings to roll up and down. The name comes from the way the rhythmic, swaying movement resembles a form of ice skating that was popular in the Netherlands. “It's just a part of aerodynamics,” said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now an aviation-safety consultant. “What you feel in the back is that the airplane sort of wallows.” Pilots train to recover from a Dutch roll, and most modern planes include a device called a yaw damper that can correct the condition by adjusting the rudder. A preliminary report by the Federal Aviation Administration said that after the Southwest plane landed, damage was discovered to a unit that controls backup power to the rudder. The damage was described as “substantial.” Cox said the structural damage likely occurred in the plane's tail fin, where the power units are housed. He was baffled that the backup unit would be damaged because normally it would not be activated during a Dutch roll.  Cox said the two-way oscillation of a Dutch roll was a dangerous phenomenon in previous Boeing jets, but not in 737s because of design changes. Boeing “737s are not prone to excessive Dutch roll. The design of the airplane is (such that) if you do absolutely nothing, the airplane will dampen the Dutch roll out naturally,” he said. “In older-model airplanes — 707s, 727s — it could develop up to the point you could lose control of the airplane.” The NTSB said it downloaded data from the plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, which will help investigators determine the length and severity of the incident. Investigators won't know precisely what the pilots were saying, however: The cockpit voice recorder was overwritten after two hours.  The pilots regained control and landed at Oakland. There were no reported injuries on the flight, which carried 175 passengers and a crew of six.  The NTSB said it expected to issue a preliminary report on the incident in about 30 days.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
88,"Lalee Ibssa, Soo Rin Kim, Kelsey Walsh","Trump turns 78, a day he'd like to pretend 'doesn't exist,' in age-focused election",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-turns-78-birthday-hed-pretend-doesnt-exist/story?id=111123900,"Not all birthdays are worth celebrating in the eyes of former President Donald Trump, who marks his 78th birthday on Friday.",2024-06-14T18:13:04Z,"Trump is not missing out on the chance to campaign on his birthday. Not all birthdays are worth celebrating in the eyes of former President Donald Trump, who marks his 78th birthday on Friday. ""There's a certain point at which you don't want to hear 'Happy Birthday.' You just want to pretend the day doesn't exist,"" Trump quipped to his supporters last week at a rally in Las Vegas after they broke out in song for him ahead of his birthday. Still, the former president is not missing out on the chance to campaign on his birthday -- marking his 78th with a sold-out speech in West Palm Beach Friday evening in front of his most fervent supporters: members of his ""Club 47"" fan group. On Thursday, Trump also received an early birthday celebration from congressional Republicans, who sang for him during their closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, sources told ABC News. They presented him with a cake with the numbers ""45"" and ""47"" as they rallied behind him in a show of force ahead of November's election.  However, in an election year where age remains a focal points for both candidates, Trump has attempted to highlight mental fitness and competency instead of age as he edges closer to the age of his opponent, President Joe Biden. ""Joe Biden is not too old to be president. I know a lot of people that are older than me. They're at the top of their game. It's not even close. But he is too incompetent,"" Trump said in a video posted on his social media platform last week. Trump repeated his claim that Biden is incompetent -- not old -- during his most recent rally in Las Vegas, even questioning the sitting president's intelligence. ""This guy -- there's just something missing,"" Trump said. ""There always has been -- by the way, he always had the worst and dumbest foreign policy."" Trump was able to fend off his younger Republican challengers during the primary as they launched attacks on his age, calling for a new generation of leadership. ""I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible? I really do,"" Trump said at a rally in January, responding to criticisms from former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley about his age. ""Now Biden can't say that, you know he can't say that."" Trump said something similar at a New Hampshire rally in January. ""I feel like I'm about 35 years old. I actually feel better now than they did 30 years ago. Tell me, is that crazy?"" Trump said. ""I feel better now. And I think cognitively I'm better than I was 20 years ago. I don't know why."" He has also routinely bragged about ""acing"" the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, a test doctors use to uncover early signs of cognitive impairment, while in the White House. ""Only about 2% in this room can do it, but I did it. I did it very easily,"" Trump said about his results on the test at an event in Las Vegas in January. ""But I got mocked -- they said, 'Oh, that's so easy.' It's not easy. It's not easy. Go home and try doing it.""  The Trump campaign has started fundraising off the former president's birthday, blasting out numerous fundraising emails to followers, asking them to sign his virtual birthday card and a donation in celebration of his birthday. ""Birthdays are incredibly important in our family, and we're counting on your help to make President Trump's birthday celebration his BIGGEST one yet! Our goal is to collect 1 MILLION signatures from Patriots like YOU wishing him a 'happy birthday,' but we're missing yours,"" the email reads. The Biden campaign is using Trump's birthday to highlight his stumbles throughout his professional and political life, releasing a list of ""78 of Trump's historic ... 'accomplishments,'"" which include his felony convictions as well as digs at his business ventures into steak, vodka and water. ""Happy birthday, Donald. You're a crook, a failure, a fraud, and a threat to our democracy, economy, rights, and future,"" Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. ""On behalf of America, our early gift for your 79th: Making sure you are never President again."" Biden has repeatedly been forced to defend his mental fitness and age due to persistent gaffes; however, his campaign has leaned into his old age, highlighting how it shows he has extensive experience to address the nation's problems. In a campaign ad released earlier this cycle, Biden acknowledged his advanced age directly. ""Look, I'm not a young guy,"" Biden said with a chuckle at the start of the ad, speaking directly to camera. ""That's no secret. Here's the deal, I understand how to get things done for the American people.""  On Biden's 81st birthday in November, the Trump campaign released a limited, generic physical exam from Trump's doctor. ""It is my opinion that President Trump is currently in excellent health, and with his continued interest in preventative health monitoring and maintenance, he will continue to enjoy a healthy active lifestyle for years to come,"" Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote in the letter. Trump's physician added Trump's physical exams were ""well within the normal range"" and his cognitive exams ""were exceptional."" However, while Trump and his campaign look to highlight Biden's gaffes and blunders, the presumptive Republican nominee has had his own share of slip ups. Throughout the campaign trail, Trump has mixed up former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with Haley -- and former President Barack Obama with Biden. Both times, the campaign has attempted to clean up his comments by stating ""its a distinction with a difference."" And as Trump often boasts about his strong mind and ability to talk off the cuff, at his most recent rally in Las Vegas, where he claimed the teleprompters weren't working because of the high heat temperatures, the former president delivered a freewheeling, tangent-filled speech. Yet still, despite the fact that polls show that voters agree that both Biden and Trump are too old to hold office for another term, they show more concern for Biden's mental fitness compared to Trump. In a Marquette University poll from last month, 79% of respondents said the phrase ""too old"" describes Biden ""very or somewhat well,"" compared to 54% saying the same of Trump. In another poll from ABC News/IPSOS in May, people were asked which personal attributes apply to either candidate more. Trump led Biden on mental sharpness 42%-23% with 34% saying it applies to neither. On physical health, Trump again led Biden 42%-20%, with 37% applying the word to neither. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
