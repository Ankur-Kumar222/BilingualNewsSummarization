Each year Apple kicks off its Worldwide Developers Conference with a few hours of just straight announcements, like the long-awaited Apple Intelligence and a makeover for smart AI assistant, Siri. We expected much of them to revolve around the company’s artificial intelligence ambitions (and here), and Apple didn’t disappoint. We also bring you news about Vision Pro and lots of feature refreshes.  Here’s how to watch the archive of WWDC 2024. Developers should expect hardware and software updates, per the usual, and some other items we initially thought would be unveiled. Brian Heater also went on Equity to dish. Now sit back and relax while the team runs down all of the biggest news in an easy-to-skim digest. Apple is making it easier for people to discover the content inside their apps using natural language — or “semantic” — queries. Already, Spotlight has been able to search for content in developers’ apps, but it would only return results when search terms matched exactly. With this year’s addition of semantic search capabilities, people will be able to search for content in apps using search terms that are just similar in meaning. Read more Now that people are using developer betas and exploring the sessions at the event, more features that were not announced onstage are surfacing. Remember that only certain devices will be compatible with iOS 18 when it’s released later in the fall. Read more Instead, Apple is adding a new two-step permissions pop-up screen that will first ask users to allow or deny access to their contacts, as before, and then, if the user allows access, will allow them to choose which contacts they want to share, if not all. Read more Brian Heater writes about consistently requesting this certain feature from Apple: the ability to pause your activity rings. If you’re down due to a cold, on an international flight, or find that you’re vigorously shaking your wrist at 9 p.m. just to finish closing your rings, you can now pause progress via the Watch or through the connected iPhone app. Read more Apple has been on a spree of late, announcing a host of new features for its various devices earlier this week. But a lot of those features were already available to some extent on Apple devices through third-party apps. So, just like the past few years, we will examine the ideas that Apple “Sherlocked” in this year’s updates. Read more The company has since revealed some of what makes its approach to generative AI different. First and foremost is scope. Many of the most prominent companies in the space take a “bigger is better” approach to their models. Read more Instead of trying to overwhelm users with too many AI features to count, the Cupertino tech giant is carefully rolling out AI where it believes it could be useful. That means the tech won’t be included where it could be much of a threat to the carefully crafted consumer experience of using an Apple device. Read more Apple delivered two of the biggest features iMessage and its Messages app that consumers were wanting for a long time: the ability to schedule messages to send at a later date and time and support for RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. Is it the end of the green bubbles? Read more Apple is giving developers more tools to increase their app revenues and promote their apps with win-back offers and the release of a new commerce API. Read more Among the highlights of the new operating system version are a set of customization options, such as being able to arrange apps and widgets on the Home Screen and customize buttons. Other features include new text effects, the ability to lock and hide apps, new ways to manage your Mail inbox, the introduction of iMessages over satellite, a significant redesign of the Photos app and more. Now let’s see if your device is compatible. Read more There was a lot, wasn’t there? Apple’s AI push was at the heart of WWDC 2024, and our AI expert Kyle Wiggers took some time to process all of the announcements before bringing together a guide to all of the news across Siri, Genmoji, ChatGPT integrations, photo editing and beyond. Read more In a post-keynote event, Apple SVP Craig Federighi confirmed that the company would work with other third-party models beyond OpenAI, with Google’s Gemini model being highlighted as the first example. He clarified that Apple had “nothing to announce right now, but that’s our general direction.” Read more  Tesla, SpaceX and xAI exec Elon Musk took to X to continue his campaign against rival OpenAI, threatening to ban Apple devices from his businesses “if Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level,” among other responses and reactions to the conversations around WWDC on X. Read more Before you get too excited about putting Apple Intelligence to the test, check if your devices are new enough. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, along with iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips, will be able to run the new features coming alongside Apple’s AI push. Read more Apple is bringing ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other Apple apps, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other generative AI models. Read more One of the Apple Intelligence-powered features coming in iOS 18 will allow iPhone users to create AI images of people they’re messaging with — a feature that works something like an AI-upgraded Bitmoji. The goal, of course, is to make your “everyday conversations more enjoyable.”  Apple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you’re talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly. Read more For those of you who use Apple TV+, there is a new feature called InSight. The feature will allow viewers to learn actor names and song titles as they appear on the screen. Lauren Forristal writes that it’s similar to Amazon’s X-Ray technology, where Fire TV users get an overview of actor bios and behind-the-scenes information while watching TV shows and movies.  What stands out about InSight, however, is its Shazam-like functionality, which highlights the song playing in the TV show or movie and gives users the option to add it to an Apple Music playlist to listen to later. Read more Apple also made some enhancements to its smart assistant, Siri. These include adding some generative AI features that make Siri seem more natural and more personal. There’s also a new glowing light. And, Siri can also handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. Plus, for those who would rather type, you can do that now. Read more The new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences. “Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted at WWDC Monday. “And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.” Read more That covers the consumer side of things, but WWDC is a conference for developers, and Apple revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software. A number of AI features will be added to existing SDKs, allowing for generative AI image generation, or new prompts to Siri, to allow devs to expand the Apple Intelligence footprint. Read more While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn’t easy to figure out. Now, the company introduced a Passwords app. Some of the features include a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren’t related to a website or service. Read more A new “Smart Script” feature will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil to write in Notes. Apple says it’s making handwriting your notes even smoother and straighter. The feature improves the appearance of your writing as you write by using on-device machine learning to recreate your handwriting from your notes. You’ll see your own handwriting, just smoother and more legible. Read more Who would have thought a calculator would liven up a developer’s conference? Well, Apple’s new Calculator for iPad app got everyone excited. iOS’ perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn’t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes. The additional feature does the math for you. Read more The latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia. One of the biggest features of this new OS is iPhone mirroring. Now, through macOS’ Continuity feature, you can mirror your iPhone’s screen and control it right from your Mac. Notifications on Mac pop you into iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well, but the paired iPhone stays locked while in mirror mode. Read more OK, let’s do a little deeper dive into iPhone mirroring. While Apple didn’t detail many use cases for the feature, Sarah Perez writes that it seems it would make it easier to demo apps over video calls or in person, as users could move between a slideshow presentation and a live demo of the iPhone app by launching it as if it’s another app on your Mac. Read more This new feature works much like Apple’s emergency SOS feature. When you have no signal, you’ll be given the option to find a satellite to relay the data. You’ll have to keep the phone pointed in the right direction while you do it, however, there’s an overlay above your messages to remind you. Read more Apple showed off the new Photos app as it will appear in the upcoming release of the iOS software. The new app introduces new navigation, new organizational features and other ways to discover your favorite photos, including those of friends, family, pets, trips and more. Some things to know: The new design will lead to less time searching for photos as it puts everything you need within easy reach. One major change involves how the app has been unified into a single view with the photo grid at the top and the library, organized by theme, below. Read more One of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones. As Brian Heater writes, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay’s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device’s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info — a nice added privacy element. Read more Users will now be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When you lock an app, if someone tries to tap your phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. While you have the app lock feature enabled, information from inside the app won’t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Read more Apple also shared some initial details for the upcoming major release of iOS, which is its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. As expected, much of this involves artificial intelligence. Remember when icons were locked to the grid? Well, they can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don’t hide your background photos. “iOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,” Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. Read more Speaking of icons, most of these updates are those long-requested functionalities, like the ability to set app icons and widgets wherever you want on the Home Screen, plus support for dark mode icons with different color schemes. Read more visionOS 2 brings with it productivity enhancements and “new immersive experiences.” One lets you “spatialize” photos from regular photos, leveraging AI tech. Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to bring up the control center with notifications, shortcuts and more. Read more One of the bigger announcements with this includes the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. Read more For those of you outside of the U.S., the Vision Pro headset will be available in eight new countries. Read more Apple has fallen behind its peers in the AI race, and it probably feels like it needs to pull out all the stops to impress fans and shareholders. But that shouldn’t mean overpromising on features. Read more For smart assistants: While rumors point to the company transitioning a number of employees to generative AI operations following its electric car implosion, all signs point to Apple having ceded a significant head start to the competition. As such, its most logical play is a partnership with a reigning powerhouse like OpenAI. Read more Maybe not for iPhone 15: Some other rumors say that when this generative AI comes into play, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro. That means the standard iPhone 15 may be left out in the cold on this one. Read more Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

1,Rebecca Szkutak,Deal Dive: Human Native AI is building the marketplace for AI training licensing deals,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/08/deal-dive-human-native-ai-is-building-the-marketplace-for-ai-training-licensing-deals/,AI systems and large language models need to be trained on massive amounts of data to be accurate but they shouldn't train on data that they don't have the...,2024-06-08T17:00:00Z,"Comment AI systems and large language models (LLMs) need to be trained on massive amounts of data to be accurate but they shouldn’t train on data that they don’t have the rights to use. OpenAI’s licensing deals with The Atlantic and Vox last week show that both sides of the table are interested in landing these AI-training content licensing agreements. Human Native AI is a London-based startup building a marketplace to broker such deals between the many companies building LLM projects and those willing to license data to them. Its goal is to help AI companies find data to train their models on while ensuring the rights holders opt in and are compensated. Rights holders upload their content for no charge and connect with AI companies to land revenue share or subscription deals. Human Native AI also helps rights holders prepare and price their content and monitors for any copyright infringements. Human Native AI takes a cut of each deal and charges AI companies for its transaction and monitoring services. James Smith, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch that he got the idea for Human Native AI from his past experience working on Google’s DeepMind project. DeepMind also ran into issues with not having enough good data to properly train the system. Then he saw other AI companies run into the same issue. “It feels like we are in the Napster-era of generative AI,” Smith said. “Can we get to a better era? Can we make it easier to acquire content? Can we give creators some level of control and compensation? I kept thinking, why is there not a marketplace?” He pitched the idea to his friend Jack Galilee, an engineer at GRAIL, during a walk in the park with their respective kids as Smith had with many other potential startup ideas. But unlike past times, Galilee said they should go for it. The company launched in April and is currently operating in beta. Smith said demand from both sides has been really encouraging and they’ve already signed a handful of partnerships that will be announced in the near future. Human Native AI announced a £2.8 million seed round led by LocalGlobe and Mercuri, two British micro VCs, this week. Smith said the company plans to use the funding to build out its team. “I’m the CEO of a two-month-old company and have been able to get meetings with CEOs of 160-year-old publishing companies,” Smith said. “That suggests to me there is a high demand on the publishing side. Equally, every conversation with a big AI company goes exactly the same way.” While still very early days, what Human Native AI is building does seem to be a missing piece of infrastructure in the growing AI industry. The big AI players need lots of data to train on and giving rights holders an easier way to work with them, while giving them full control of how their content is used, seems like a good approach that can make both sides of the table happy. “Sony Music just sent letters to 700 AI companies asking that they cease and desist,” Smith said. “That is the size of the market and potential customers that could be acquiring data. [With] the number of publishers and rights holders, it could be thousands if not tens of thousands. We think that’s the reason we need infrastructure.” I also think this could be even more beneficial to the smaller AI systems that don’t necessarily have the resources to ink a deal with Vox or The Atlantic to still be able to access data to train on. Smith said that they hope for that, too, and that all of the notable licensing deals thus far have involved the larger AI players. He hopes Human Native AI can help level the playing field. “One of the major challenges with licensing content is you have a large upfront costs and you massively restrict who you can work with,” Smith said. “How do we increase the number of buyers for your content and reduce the barriers to entry? We think that is really exciting.” The other interesting piece here is the future potential of the data that Human Native AI collects. Smith said that in the future they will be able to give rights holders more clarity around how to price their content based on a history of deal data on the platform. It is also a smart time for Human Native AI to launch. Smith said with the European Union AI Act evolving, and potential AI regulation in the U.S. down the road, AI companies ethically sourcing their data — and having the receipts to prove it — will only become more pressing. “We are optimistic about the future of AI and what it will do, but we have to make sure as an industry we are responsible and don’t decimate industries that have gotten us to this point,” Smith said. “That would not be good for human society. We need to make sure we find the correct ways to enable people to participate. We are AI optimists on the side of humans.” Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

2,Julie Bort,Rippling bans former employees who work at competitors like Deel and Workday from its tender offer stock sale,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/rippling-former-employees-competitors-deel-workday-tender-offer-stock-sale/,"Investor demand has been so strong for shares of hot HR startup Rippling – over $2 billion worth of term sheets, it says – that it is allowing former...",2024-06-07T22:20:55Z,"Comment Investor demand has been so strong for shares of hot HR startup Rippling — over $2 billion worth of term sheets, it says — that it is allowing former employees to also participate in its giant tender offer sale, the company told TechCrunch. But there is one big exception: It has banned former employees who work for a handful of competitors from selling their stock. A small group of ex-employees has been trying to get the company to alter this policy, TechCrunch has learned, but so far to no avail. Rippling has also told employees who have previously sold shares, particularly if those sales were outside its previous tender offer, that they would not be authorized to sell as many shares this time around. To recap: In April, TechCrunch broke the news that Rippling was doing a giant tender offer of up to $590 million for employees and existing investors, led by Coatue, along with a smaller $200 million Series F for the company. All told, the deal valued HR software startup Rippling at $13.5 billion, the company said.  This wasn’t the first and only sale that let employees and longtime investors cash out of some shares, but it’s by far the biggest and most profitable. Another smaller one took place in 2021, founder and CEO Parker Conrad told TechCrunch’s GM and EIC Connie Loizos. The rules for this one, according to a summary of details seen by TechCrunch, were: Rippling tells TechCrunch that the employees who work for the following companies are excluded: Workday, Paylocity, Gusto, Deel, Remote.com, Justworks, HiBob, and Personio. Sources tell TechCrunch that employees at those companies received no information about the tender offer but heard about their exclusion through the grapevine. None of the former employees TechCrunch spoke to were surprised to hear one name on the list: Deel. Or, according to a post on Blind, “Everyone who has options is eligible, even former employees. Except if you went to Deel then you’re screwed lol.” When some former employees realized they were being excluded from the sale, a few wrote a scathing letter to Conrad and Rippling’s top lawyer, Vanessa Wu, imploring Rippling to change its mind. Rippling refused to do so.  Indeed there was quite a bit of internal drama involving the letter, as well as the equally scathing letters, seen by TechCrunch, that Rippling sent to some of them in response. The drama involved some people distancing themselves from the letter and many allegations of wrongdoing on both sides that TechCrunch could not independently verify. One person who was reportedly dragged into the letter drama told TechCrunch they wanted nothing more to do with any of it.  The company told TechCrunch it was omitting employees at competitors because it was concerned that the sensitive information “including detailed financial information and risk factors” disclosed in the offer paperwork could wind up shared with competitors. “Rippling put together a tender offer for the benefit of its employees, ex-employees, and early investors. Rippling chose to be uncharacteristically broad in its approach to this tender offer (1) because Rippling wanted to be able to provide liquidity to its early employees and investors, and also, (2) because there was so much demand (received over $2B in term sheets),” Rippling VP of communications Bobby Whithorne told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “However, tender offer rules require companies to share significant sensitive information, including private company financials, which reasonably are not materials that any company would want in the hands of its competitors. As a result, while most companies exclude former employees entirely, Rippling took the more measured approach of excluding only those former employees who currently work at a list of eight competitors with ambitions to build global HR and payroll products,” Whithorne said. To be sure, as a private company, Rippling certainly has the freedom to place restrictions on participation in its stock sales. Several sources said that Deel is a particularly touchy subject at Rippling. Both companies play into the rivalry with marketing that touts their own tech stack is better than the other.  Rippling’s hard-charging CEO Conrad is internally revered as a product genius but is also known as a competitive guy who thrives on rivalry, these sources said. He built Rippling into a $13.5 billion HR tech success with a product that tightly integrates payroll, benefits, recruiting, and a whole bunch of other services. He also famously built a previous HR tech startup, Zenefits, into one of the fastest-growing startups of its time until it hit a world of trouble that ultimately led to his ouster. During his time at Zenefits, Conrad also had a very public spat with competitor ADP. Then he founded Rippling, which has also grown like dandelions under his care.  Despite the rivalry, Deel was once a customer of Rippling, though it no longer is, sources tell us. One other thing to note about excluding ex-Rippling employees working at competitors is that it’s not just about making a profit on their stock. Stock options can be costly. In addition to the price of the stock, employees may face huge tax bills on options they exercise from the paper gains of the value of the stock. Sometimes selling a portion of their stake, if they can, is a way for them to offset such tax bills.  When asked about this, Whithorne said that the company has “tried to issue Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) wherever possible (all U.S. employees) which enable employees to defer tax obligations at the time of exercise.” All employees, current or former, will be able to sell their stock one day, after a lockup period, after the company goes public. But it’s not clear when Rippling will stage an offering. The company isn’t likely in need of more capital at the moment. It just raised that new $200 million infusion, on top of the emergency $500 million it famously raised in 2023 as part of the whole SVB crisis. For several of the people impacted by this decision, however, it’s not just the money. It’s also about hurt feelings that their former company believes they would do illegal or unethical things and so they are being preemptively left out of a lucrative deal. “Your company doesn’t love you, or value you. They are always going to do what is in their best interest. So do what’s in your best interest,” one source said. Got a tip about a startup culture you’ve experienced?

3,Aria Alamalhodaei,We’re about to learn a whole lot more about how the human body reacts to space,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/were-about-to-learn-a-whole-lot-more-about-how-the-human-body-reacts-to-space/,"A sign that the renaissance is imminent appeared earlier this week, when the journal Nature published a cache of papers detailing the physical and mental...",2024-06-13T22:35:39Z,"Comment We could be entering a renaissance for human spaceflight research, as a record number of private citizens head to space — and as scientists improve techniques for gathering data on these intrepid test subjects.  A sign that the renaissance is imminent appeared earlier this week, when the journal Nature published a cache of papers detailing the physical and mental changes the four-person Inspiration4 crew experienced nearly three years ago. That mission, in partnership with SpaceX, launched on September 15, 2021 and returned to Earth three days later.  During the mission, the crew experienced a broad set of modest molecular changes, dysregulated immune systems and slight decreases in cognitive performance. But researchers are only able to analyze the data — more than 100,000 health-related data points — because the four-person crew was able to reliably collect it in the first place.  This is a bigger accomplishment than one might realize. The Inspiration4 crew received plenty of training, in large part with SpaceX, which provided the Dragon capsule for their ride through orbit. But their preparation is still a far cry from that of NASA astronauts aboard the ISS, and who also regularly perform a battery of health tests on themselves. That includes ultrasounds, cognitive tests, biopsies, blood and saliva testing, skin swabs and sensorimotor tests.  “You can do research with private individuals in space, that is the number one result [of the research],” said Dr. Dorit Donoviel in a recent interview. Dr. Donoviel is co-author of one of the papers published in Nature and associate professor in the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. She’s also the executive director of NASA-funded research consortium Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), which conducts and funds cutting-edge research to improve human safety in space.  “I’ll be honest, nobody was sure that we were going to be able to gather a reasonable amount of data, that we were going to be able to implement it, that regular people who have never had exposure to scientific research could do something that we would actually be able to analyze,” she continued, referring to the Inspiration4 mission.  In some obvious ways, the Inspiration4 crew are far from ordinary: The mission’s leader, Jared Isaacman, is a billionaire that founded a payment processing company when he was 16; Hayley Arcenaux is a physician’s assistant at the world-renowned St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; Sian Proctor is a pilot with a PhD who teaches geology at the college level; and Christopher Sembroski is a former U.S. Air Force journeyman whose long career as an aerospace engineer brought him to his current workplace, Blue Origin. And yet, they still came to Inspiration4 as spaceflight novices. That meant TRISH researchers had to come up with a testing suite that could be performed with minimal training. The Inspiration4 crew also wore Apple Watches, and the capsule was outfitted with environmental sensors that researchers were able to correlate to the other testing results. Correlating the data is “unusual,” Dr. Donoviel said, but it gave researchers unique insights into how changes in the confined environment affected things like heart rate or cognitive performance.  Overall, researchers are trying to move toward digitizing testing and making more of the data-gathering passive, to lower the cognitive overhead on the private astronaut. (NASA astronauts also take cognitive tests, but they are using a very old test developed in the 1970s, Dr. Donoviel said.)  Gathering such information will be critical as the number of private citizens heading to space increases, as it seems almost certainly poised to do in the coming decade. Researchers will be better able to understand the effects of spaceflight on people that don’t fit the mold of the typical NASA astronaut: male, white and in the top percentiles for physical and cognitive performance. But they’ll only be able to do so if the future space tourists are willing to collect the data.  More data means a better understanding of how spaceflight affects women versus men, or could help future space tourists with pre-existing conditions understand how they will fare in the zero-G environment. The results from Inspiration4 are promising, especially for space tourism: TRISH’s paper found, based on the data from that mission, short-duration missions do not pose significant health risks. This latest preliminary finding adds to existing data that longer-term stints in space — in this case, 340 days — may not be as dangerous as once presumed. So far, commercial providers ranging from Axiom Space to SpaceX to Blue Origin have been more than willing to work with TRISH, and agreed to standardize and pool the data collected on their respective missions, Dr. Donoviel said.   “They’re all competing for these people [as customers], but this allows them to contribute to a common knowledge base,” she added.   This is only the beginning. The rise in non-governmental spaceflight missions raises major questions related to the norms, ethics and regulation of human research in space. While more private citizens are likely headed to space than ever before, will they be interested in being guinea pigs in order to further scientific research? Will a private astronaut paying $50 million for a luxury space tourism experience want to spend their time in orbit conducting ultrasounds on themselves or meticulously measuring their temporary cognitive decline?  Possibly; possibly not. Last year, Donoviel co-published an article in Science calling for, among other things, the development of a set of principles to guide commercial spaceflight missions. One of those principles the authors called for is social responsibility — essentially, the idea that private astronauts arguably have a heightened social responsibility to advance this research. “If you’re going to space, you’re resting on the laurels of all of the public funding that has enabled you to go to space. The taxpayers paid for all of those space capabilities that have now enabled you to go to space. So you owe the taxpayers the research,” Dr. Donoviel argued. She added that advances in wearable tech have only lowered the burden on the research participants — not just with the Apple Watch, but with tech like the Biobutton device that continuously collects many vital signs or a sweat patch.   “We’re not going to make it miserable for you, we’re not going to poke you with a needle, we’re not going to make you do an ultrasound, but wear the Biobutton and put on the sweat patch.”  The story has been updated to reflect that Dr. Donoviel works at Baylor College of Medicine, not Baylor University, and that NASA’s cognitive tests were developed in the 1970s.

4,Rebecca Szkutak,"In 2024, many Y Combinator startups only want tiny seed rounds — but there’s a catch",https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/y-combinator-yc-startups-tiny-seed-rounds-vc-investors-not-interested/,"When Bowery Capital general partner Loren Straub started talking to a startup from the latest Y Combinator accelerator batch a few months ago, she thought it...",2024-06-07T19:20:08Z,"Featured Article Comment When Bowery Capital general partner Loren Straub started talking to a startup from the latest Y Combinator accelerator batch a few months ago, she thought it was strange that the company didn’t have a lead investor for the round it was raising. Even stranger, the founders didn’t seem to be looking for one. She thought it was an anomaly until she talked to about nine other startups, Straub told TechCrunch. They were all looking to raise nearly identical rounds: $1.5 million to $2 million with around a $15 million post-money valuation, while giving up only 10% of their companies — aside from YC’s standard deal, where it takes a 7% stake. Most had raised the majority of that already from multiple angels with only a few hundred thousand dollars’ worth of shares left to sell. “It was impossible to get double-digit ownership in any of the deals,” she said. “At least two of the companies I spoke to had a bunch of angels but no institutional capital.” These dynamics mean there are likely numerous startups among the 249-strong YC winter batch that won’t be raising from traditional seed investors at all. That happens with every cohort, of course, but the difference this time is that the traditional seed investors would have liked to fund them. However, many seed investors, like Straub, have a 10% equity ownership minimum. In fact, selling 20% of the startup is considered fairly standard for a seed round. Institutional investors typically require 10% equity to lead a round, too. In its early-stage advice guide, YC even says that most rounds require 20% but also advises, “if you can manage to give up as little as 10% of your company in your seed round, that is wonderful.” A YC spokesperson confirmed that they encourage founders to only raise what they need. They also said that since YC upped its standard deal to include $500,000 of capital in 2022, more companies are raising less and looking to give away less equity. YC doesn’t spend much time on fundraising in the program, a nod to the success of Demo Day, but companies can always talk about it with their group partner, the spokesperson added. There is nothing wrong with seeking less money (most YC companies are very early in their journey after all). However, these startups are still seeking higher valuations than what startups that didn’t attend the storied accelerator are getting in the wild. The current median seed deal size is $3.1 million, according to Q1 PitchBook data, with the median pre-money valuation sitting at $12 million. YC startups are asking for larger valuations on less money and for smaller stakes. This does not include the 7% equity stake from YC, which Straub said many companies consider separately. Straub wasn’t the only VC who noticed that more YC companies seem to be shooting for that 10% goal this time around. Another VC told TechCrunch that in a tough fundraising market — as 2024 is — YC’s 7% stake may prompt startups to look for less dilution, while a third VC said that many of the rounds in this batch looked more like pre-seed or family-and-friends rounds than seed. While valuations are obviously down from the wild bull days of 2020 and 2021, with the latest YC batch, “the round sizes were also very restrained. You are seeing round sizes that are more like $1.5 million and $2 million, fewer that are larger,” said an institutional VC who looked at potential deals. Of course, out of hundreds of companies in the cohort, there were outliers. Leya, a Stockholm-based AI-powered legal workflow platform announced a $10.5 million seed round last month led by Benchmark. Drug discovery platform startup Yoneda Labs raised a $4 million seed round in May from Khosla Ventures, among others. Basalt, a software company focused on satellites, raised a $3.5 million seed round in May led by Initialized Capital. AI medical transcription startup Hona raised $3 million from a multitude of angels, corporate funds and institutional VCs like General Catalyst and 1984 Ventures. Just for comparison, REGENT, from the Winter 2021 cohort, an electric seaglider company, raised $27 million across two rounds with a $150 million pre-money valuation. In 2020, a16z invested $16 million into one of the buzziest startups of the summer cohort, internal compensation Pave, formerly known as Trove, for a rumored post-money $75 million valuation. YC valuations got so high in 2021, they became somewhat of a joke in the industry and on social media. But even as the market began to soften, YC deals remained expensive. Every (Summer 2023), a bookkeeping and payroll startup, raised a $9.5 million seed round led by Base10 Partners in November 2023. Massdriver (Winter 2022), a DevOps standardization platform, raised $8 million in what it called an angel round in August 2023 led by Builders VC. Bluedot (Winter 2023) raised a $5 million seed round with no lead investor in June 2023. The trend toward smaller rounds shows that YC’s current batches of founders have become more realistic toward current market conditions. But they are also expecting that the YC badge will be enough for institutional seed VCs to either ignore their fund’s ownership requirements or be willing to pay over market value to invest in their young startups. Many of these startups will find that being a YC-backed company just isn’t enough to override a VC’s investment requirements. And while going through the accelerator program definitely does give these companies a level of prowess compared to startups of the same age that haven’t, many VCs just aren’t as interested in YC companies as they once were. From the heady days when YC cohorts grew to more than 400 companies, the accelerator isn’t considered as selective as it once was by many VCs — even though it has shrunk its cohort size in recent years. And its startups are also thought to be too expensive. Investors complain about the inflated valuations on LinkedIn and Twitter, and a TechCrunch survey last fall found that VCs that had invested in the past were sitting out now mainly because of the price to entry for these companies. The companies seem to feel some of the shine fading as well. One YC founder in the recent batch told TechCrunch that their startup is raising more of a traditional seed round because it was further along in the startup journey when it joined YC. But the person knew of many others seeking smaller rounds because they weren’t confident they could raise more at their stage, which makes the higher valuation all the more interesting. “It’s gotten significantly harder to put $1.5 million and a $15 million [valuation] together than it used to be,” the YC founder said. “As a result of that, I think more founders are getting to like $600,000 and $700,000 and that’s the only checks they can get at the end of the day.” The founder added that some other YC founders will look to raise $1.5 million from angels with the hope of drumming up interest from institutional or lead investors after the fact. But as seed funds have gotten larger in recent years, and many seed investors are looking to write larger checks, some YC companies are choosing to forgo a lead investor in these conditions. If YC startups treat these rounds more like pre-seed funding, with the intent to raise a seed down the line, it’s not all bad. Many startups that raised lofty seed rounds in 2020 and 2021 with hefty valuations likely wished they raised less at a lower valuation in the current Series A market crunch. Raising these smaller, less-dilutive rounds, mostly from angels, also allows companies to grow a little before raising a proper seed. But the risk is, if companies are labeling these smaller rounds as “seed rounds” with their sights set on next raising a Series A, they could run into problems. Some companies that raise a small seed round won’t have enough funds to grow into what the Series A investors are looking for, Amy Cheetham, a partner at Costanoa Ventures, told TechCrunch. She also noticed YC deals seemed a bit smaller than usual this time around. “I worry those businesses end up getting under capitalized,” Cheetham said. “They will have to raise a seed plus or whatever they need to do. There is an issue with that construct.” And if the startup does need more money between a seed and Series A round, not having institutional backers to turn to will make getting that capital a bit trickier. There’s no obvious investor to help with raising a bridge round or other extension funding. This is particularly so for the startups that don’t have a lead investor. That tends to mean they’ve got no investor with a large network holding a board seat. No investor board member can also mean they’ve got no one who will introduce the founder to other investors, greasing the wheels for the next raise. Many startups realized the downfalls of raising without a committed lead investor in 2022 when times started getting tough and they didn’t have that champion to turn to for money or to tap into that person’s network. But YC president and CEO Garry Tan doesn’t seem as concerned about that. “While it is helpful to have a good investor, the reason why a company lives or dies is not who their investors are but whether they make something people want,” Tan told TechCrunch over email. “Fundraising is the beginning of a starting line of a new race. Winning the race is what matters, not what brand of fuel you put in the tank.” There have always been YC companies that raise smaller rounds, and outliers that score big capital checks and valuations, but if more companies lean toward smaller rounds, it will be interesting to see if this turns off seed investors who have historically spent their time talking to YC companies looking for deals. Ironically, in the long run, that actually may be a good thing. Those investors may be interested in a Series A. “I’m probably more excited about going back to lead Series A deals that were in a batch a year or two ago,” Cheetham said. “Some of that pricing will work through the system and then you can go and write a sizable check at the A.

Anders, the astronaut behind perhaps the single most iconic photo of our planet, has died at the age of 90. On Friday morning, Anders was piloting a small plane that dove into the water near Roche Harbor, Washington. His son Greg confirmed his death. Anders retired from the Air Force Reserve as a major general but was a major at the time of the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. Apollo 8 was the first manned mission to orbit the moon, which also made Anders one of the first people to leave the bounds of Earth’s orbit. On Christmas Eve, all three Apollo crew members took photos of Earth as it rose over the moon’s horizon, but Anders was the only one shooting on color film. The ship’s onboard tape recorder captured the astronaut exclaiming, “Oh my God, look at that picture over there! There’s the Earth comin’ up. Wow, is that pretty!” The resulting photograph, titled “Earthrise,” captured Earth’s loneliness and fragility in a way that no image ever had before. It was particularly iconic to the nascent environmental movement — 50 years later, Earth Day Network president Kathleen Rogers wrote that photo “confirmed” the movement’s conviction “that the Earth’s environment was common to all of us, that the Earth’s natural resources were finite, and that 150 years of unfettered industrial development was having a profound impact on our planet.” In an interview conducted in 2015, Anders noted that his photo seemed better remembered than the Apollo 8 mission itself. “Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth,” he said.

6,Tim De Chant,Unigrid wants to make batteries cheaper and safer using sodium,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/unigrid-wants-to-make-batteries-cheaper-and-safer-using-sodium/,"While that’s low enough to have triggered quickening adoption of electric vehicles, even the cheapest lithium-ion chemistries are still too expensive to put ...",2024-06-13T14:00:00Z,"Comment If there’s one thing holding back batteries, it’s cost. The most widespread type of battery, lithium-ion, still costs around $140 per kilowatt-hour for a pack. While that’s low enough to have triggered quickening adoption of electric vehicles, even the cheapest lithium-ion chemistries are still too expensive to put a big battery in every home to protect against blackouts. Instead, manufacturers have started to explore sodium-ion batteries, not as a replacement, but as a complement to lithium-ion.  “When produced at the same scale, sodium-ion should be about half of where lithium-iron-phosphate is in terms of cost to produce because the raw materials are a hundred times cheaper,” Darren Tan, co-founder and CEO of Unigrid, told TechCrunch. Despite the promise, sodium-ion isn’t quite ready for widespread use. Batteries made with it are not very dense, making them too large and too heavy for EVs. Plus, many variants behave differently from lithium-ion when they’re charging and discharging, meaning packs made with sodium-ion need new electronics to manage them. Tan’s startup thinks it has solved those problems by using a new chemistry based on sodium-chromium-oxide in one half of the battery and tin in the other (though Tan emphasizes the company can substitute other materials on either side). Unigrid’s batteries don’t take up any more space than a lithium-iron-phosphate cell, sometimes less. Plus, their power output mimics that of lithium-ion so the company can use the same electronics, and they are made with widely available materials. “Chromium is produced at twice the quantity of copper each year,” Tan said. The company was born out of Tan’s research at UC San Diego, where he was a doctoral student under Shirley Meng, a prolific materials scientist who focuses on energy storage. Their goal wasn’t just to create a cheaper battery, but also one that’s safer. Unigrid’s batteries won’t go into thermal runaway and catch fire until the internal temperature rises to several hundred degrees Celsius, Tan said. “Sodium-ion should not just be like lithium-ion, it should be way safer such that we can put it in buildings, hospitals, data centers, so we can achieve widespread distributed energy storage,” he said. To deliver that many batteries, Unigrid isn’t going to be building its own factories. Instead, it’ll be working with smaller battery manufacturers that exist simply to make other companies’ designs. Think of them like TSMC, which produces computer chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia, albeit much smaller in scale. Unigrid’s chemistry works on their existing equipment, and Tan said there’s enough spare capacity at these facilities to produce batteries on a megawatt-hour scale. Unigrid’s first market will be energy storage for buildings and small campuses, but it’s also looking to supply manufacturers of so-called light EVs, things like scooters, motorcycles and tuk-tuks. Small vehicles like these are popular in India and Southeast Asia, where the intense heat can make lithium-ion batteries prone to overheating. “There’s a huge opportunity there where the climate is very warm and lots of battery fires occur,” Tan said. To get its sodium-ion batteries into production, Unigrid has raised a $12 million Series A. The round was led by Transition VC and Ritz Venture Capital, with participation from Union Square Ventures and Foothill Ventures.  Tan hopes that Unigrid will be selling cells sooner than later. “We really wanted to do something that could make a more immediate and shorter-term impact, something that we could get into the market in the next five years,” he said.

7,Jagmeet Singh,"WhatsApp adds new features to the calling experience, including support for 32-person video calls",https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/whatsapp-add-new-features-to-the-calling-experience-including-support-for-32-person-video-calls/,WhatsApp updated the video calling experience across devices on Thursday by introducing screen sharing with audio support and a new speaker spotlight feature...,2024-06-13T15:54:57Z,"Comment WhatsApp updated the video calling experience across devices on Thursday by introducing screen sharing with audio support and a new speaker spotlight feature. It’s also increasing the limit for video call participants to up to 32 people. In August last year, WhatsApp introduced screen-sharing support for video calls. The instant messaging app has now enhanced that experience by enabling support to share audio alongside your screen. This will let you watch videos with your contacts on a WhatsApp call. The other significant update that WhatsApp has made to its video calling is the expanded limit, which allows users to have up to 32 people on a single video call across devices. Before this update, WhatsApp had a 32-participant limit on mobile devices, while users on Windows and macOS could add up to 16 and 8 participants, respectively. WhatsApp’s expanded video calling support across devices aligns with Apple’s FaceTime, which also allows iPhone and iPad users to have up to 32 participants on video calls. However, Google Meet and Zoom allow users to have up to 100 people even when they are on the basic tier. The latest slew of updates on WhatsApp also brings the speaker spotlight to automatically highlight the participant who’s talking on a video call and make them appear first on the screen. Additionally, WhatsApp parent Meta introduced the Meta Low Bitrate (MLow) codec on WhatsApp to improve call reliability even if the user has poor network connectivity or uses an older device. It comes as a significant upgrade to the open source codec Opus, which Meta earlier deployed across its real-time communication products. The proprietary codec is rated to deliver twice the audio quality of Opus even while keeping 10% lower computational complexity than that of the open source codec. MLow is already available on Instagram and Messenger calls and is now rolling out on WhatsApp to enhance the calling experience across Meta platforms. Alongside MLow, WhatsApp said in a blog post that it will roll out all the latest calling-related updates to all eligible users over the next few weeks.

The investment, roughly $80 million of which...",2024-06-13T15:43:11Z,"Comment Amazon says that it will commit up to $230 million to startups building generative AI-powered applications. The investment, roughly $80 million of which will fund Amazon’s second AWS Generative AI Accelerator program, aims to position AWS as an attractive cloud infrastructure choice for startups developing generative AI models to power their products, apps and services. Much of the new tranche — including the entire portion set aside for the accelerator program — comes in the form of compute credits for AWS infrastructure, meaning that it can’t be transferred to other cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. To sweeten the pot, Amazon is pledging that startups in this year’s Generative AI Accelerator cohort will gain access to experts and tech from Nvidia, the program’s presenting partner. They will also be invited to join the Nvidia Inception program, which provides companies opportunities to connect with potential investors and additional consulting resources. The Generative AI Accelerator program has also grown substantially. Last year’s cohort, which had 21 startups, received only up to $300,000 in AWS compute credits, amounting to around a combined $6.3 million investment. “With this new effort, we will help startups launch and scale world-class businesses, providing the building blocks they need to unleash new AI applications that will impact all facets of how the world learns, connects, and does business,” Matt Wood, VP of AI products at AWS, said in a statement.  Amazon’s growing spending on generative AI tech, which includes efforts like its $100 million AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, free credits for startups using major AI models and its Project Olympus model, comes as the company looks to catch up to tech giant rivals in the blooming — and increasingly competitive — generative AI space. While Amazon claims that its various generative AI businesses have reached “multiple billions” in run rate, the company is widely perceived as having missed the boat on generative AI. AWS originally planned to unveil its own generative AI model akin to OpenAI’s ChatGPT code-named Bedrock — which eventually became Amazon’s Bedrock model hosting service — at its annual conference in November 2022, according to The Information. But major bugs forced the organization to postpone the launch. (Amazon PR disputes this.)  Amazon’s Alexa division has been beset with challenges as well, thanks to technical setbacks and political infighting, as reported by Fortune’s Sharon Goldman this week. Nine months after a splashy press demo of a “next-gen” Alexa, the new Alexa is reportedly far from ready for prime time — the result of insufficient training data, inadequate access to training hardware and other roadblocks. Amazon also passed on early opportunities to back two leading AI startups, Cohere and Anthropic. The company later tried to invest in Cohere, but was rejected — and had to settle for a co-investment (albeit a large one, totaling $4 billion) in Anthropic with chief rival Google.  Besides the recent departure of Howard Wright, AWS’ head of startups, who managed startup relationships at the org, a hurdle in Amazon’s way is growing scrutiny from regulators over Big Tech’s investments in AI startups. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently opened an inquiry on Microsoft’s backing of OpenAI, as well as Google and Amazon’s investments in Anthropic. European policymakers have signaled they’re skeptical of such deals as well. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

9,Sarah Perez,"At last, Apple’s Messages app will support RCS and scheduling texts",https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/at-last-apples-messages-app-will-support-rcs-and-scheduling-texts/,"These messaging features, announced at WWDC 2024, will have a significant impact on how people communicate every day.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-11T17:57:00Z,"Comment The biggest updates coming to Apple’s iMessage and its Messages app in iOS 18 aren’t its AI emoji, Genmoji, or even the ability to send texts via satellite. It’s the ability to finally, finally schedule messages to send at a later date and time, as well as support for RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. Though buried amid a slate of AI announcements and other user interface tweaks at WWDC 2024, these messaging features will have a significant impact on how people communicate every day. For years, consumer demand for scheduling messages has led developers to create complicated and cumbersome workarounds, like apps that remind you via push notifications to send a text, for example, or solutions that only worked on jailbroken iPhones. The new iOS will offer the ability to schedule your messages to be sent later as built-in functionality. The feature only got a brief mention at WWDC. In Apple’s press release, it was announced in the same sentence as the Tapbacks upgrade, which has expanded to include support for any emoji or sticker in iOS 18. Clearly, Apple doesn’t think “Send Later” is a feature worth spending much time on. But for anyone who runs a business from their iPhone — or people who only remember the important things they need to text while laying in bed at 3 a.m. — the new scheduling feature will be a much-welcomed addition. Beyond simply making life easier, like when you want to text someone across time zones without disturbing them, Apple’s screenshot suggests you could also use the feature to ensure you don’t miss sending someone a birthday greeting. Of even greater importance, however, is the Messages app’s support for RCS, the messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will address many of the grievances of texting those Android users with a green bubble.  For a long time, Google has urged and campaigned for Apple to adopt the standard, which would improve the communication experience between Android and iOS users. The Wall Street Journal ran a report on the fight over the green bubbles and how blue bubbles are a must-have for U.S. teens. While EU regulators ultimately decided that iMessage was not popular enough to be forced to open up and become interoperable with other messaging services, the additional scrutiny likely influenced Apple’s decision here — as did U.S. lawmakers’ interest in Apple’s shutdown of Beeper, a third-party app that brought iMessage to Android users. Because of Apple’s longtime refusal to add support for RCS, texting with Android users meant no typing indicators or read receipts, broken group chats and blurry photos and videos. It also meant that messages would not be end-to-end encrypted as they were on iMessage. Unfortunately for Android users, Messages sent via RCS won’t be relieved of the green bubble curse on Apple devices according to screenshots on its website, which show the feature in action. Instead, the text box indicates in a light gray font that your texts with someone support both “Text message + RCS,” while the texts themselves are still green.  However, issues that make the Messages app a broken experience for Apple’s customers will be addressed, it seems, as Apple says it will support the standard later this year. The news, of course, only got a brief mention in Apple’s press release, where it noted that RCS would allow for “richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.”  Earlier reports indicated Apple intends to work with the GSMA to add support for end-to-end encryption in the Universal Profile for RCS, but won’t support E2EE out of the gate. That’s likely why there was no mention of encrypted messaging in Apple’s announcement of RCS. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

For personal use only.",2024-06-11T15:45:16Z,"Comment Apple’s keynote at WWDC 2024 was packed with new platform updates and the release of Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI offering. But after all, it’s a developer conference, and Apple is giving developers more tools to increase their app revenues and promote their apps with win-back offers and the release of a new commerce API. Apple will let developers reach out to customers who have subscribed to the app to win them back with new offers. Developers can configure which customers they want to reach out to, and based on that, Apple surfaces win-back offers in the App Store. Users can easily redownload the app through this offer card. “Eligible customers can discover win-back offers across the App Store, including on your product page and in editorial selections on the Today, Games and Apps tabs, as well as within your app,” according to Apple. Apple said that it is adding Focus State to the App Store later this year for improved search. This includes surfacing recent searches and suggesting personalized recommendations of search terms. Apple will introduce a new kind of in-app purchase later this year: new APIs for “complex monetization” use cases. It gave examples of content creator apps offering subscriptions, apps with large catalogs of content (maybe apps that offer sachet subscriptions to different content), and digital content that spans across different apps managed by one developer. Developers can now notify Apple’s App Store editorial team when they are launching a new app or update and get a chance to be featured on different pages. The company said developers can highlight content like an in-app event, preorder for an app, or a major update. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

And this year’s WWDC is a doozy. Thanks to Apple’s newfound — and heavy — investment in generative AI tech, the company had loads to showcase on the AI front, from an upgraded Siri to AI-generated emoji. Apple announced a deal with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot experience, to a range of its devices. It introduced new photo-editing tools to remove objects and people from photos. And it rolled out an AI capability to proofread, rewrite and summarize text across content, including notes to emails. Here’s a roundup of a few of the more noteworthy Apple AI announcements from WWDC 2024.  Siri got a makeover courtesy of Apple’s overarching generative AI push this year, called Apple Intelligence. Thanks to Apple Intelligence, Siri, which has a revamped look, including a new icon and glowing indicator light around the edges of a device’s screen, can now handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. You can now also type to Siri, and it can answer questions, including questions about how to use your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Soon, Siri will become even more capable with onscreen awareness and the ability to take action in and across apps — so you can ask Siri to, for example, “make this photo pop” and then “add this photo” to another app. During the WWDC keynote on Monday, Apple gave the example of Siri finding a photo of your license, extracting your ID number and entering it into a web form for you. To take advantage of the new Siri, you’ll need an Apple device that supports Apple Intelligence — specifically the iPhone 15 Pro and devices with M1 or newer chips.  Apple’s bringing ChatGPT to Siri and other first-party apps and capabilities across its operating systems.  Siri users will soon be able to route questions to ChatGPT for “expertise” where it might be helpful, Apple says. You can include photos with the questions you ask ChatGPT via Siri, or ask questions related to your docs or PDFs.  Apple’s also integrated ChatGPT into OS-wide tools such as Writing Tools (powered by Apple Intelligence), which allows you to create content with ChatGPT — including images — or ask an initial idea and send it to ChatGPT to get a revision or variation back. ChatGPT integrations will arrive on iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year, Apple says, and will be free without the need to create a ChatGPT or OpenAI account. Initially, they’ll be powered by GPT-4o, OpenAI’s recently introduced flagship generative AI model. Genmoji, coming soon to iOS 18 on devices that support Apple Intelligence, lets you create AI emoji-like images of anyone in your photo library — or just custom emoji. Genmoji can be used as a sticker for reacting to messages with a Tapback or inline with your messages, Apple says. A separate new image-generation capability allows iPhone users to create AI images of people they’re messaging with. Apple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you’re chatting with, Apple says — so if you want to personalize the chat with a custom AI image, you can do so on the fly. There’s also Image Playground, a new image-generating feature that works across apps like Notes, Freeform, Keynote and Pages.  Available as a standalone app and API for developers, Image Playground allows users to create images using concepts such as themes, costumes, accessories, places and more. You select the themes you want to include and, minutes later, Image Playground creates a preview of your image. Apple’s new Clean Up tool, built into the upgraded Photos app, removes unwanted people and objects from pics. Clean Up can be used on any picture in Photos by circling or highlighting the thing — or person — to be removed. Relying on AI, Clean Up removes the selected element and replaces it with contextually-aware pixels to try to make it seem like the thing (or person) was never there to begin with.  On the subject of Photos, it’s now better organized thanks to AI. Coming in iOS 18, Photos will show collections of photos automatically organized by topics like time, people, favorite memories, trips and more. And you’ll be able to use more specific terms to search across photos. Coming soon to iPhone 15 Pro and newer models, iOS will optionally record and transcribe your phone calls.  The feature — which must be enabled manually, and which informs the party on the other end of the line that the call is being recorded so as to not run afoul of privacy laws — transcribes what’s said during the call and then provides a summary of the key points discussed in iOS’ Notes app. Apple noted (no pun intended) during the keynote on Monday that you’ll also be able to record and transcribe audio from within the Notes app. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

At the top of the list is the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. The move is a bid to increase content creation for the headset, which Apple announced at last year’s WWDC. Users can now convert older photos captured on older devices. It comes in the wake of what has been a slow start for the company’s long-awaited entry into the mixed reality space. The efficacy of machine-generated images remains to be seen, but likely won’t offer as accurate an image as those shots captured with depth cameras. The feature is arriving as part of the new visionOS 2 release, which should be available later this year. Apple also announced this morning that the formerly U.S.-only headset will now be available in additional countries.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

15,Kyle Wiggers,Apple gives Siri a makeover,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-gives-siri-a-makeover/,"Siri is now more natural, more relevant and more personal — and it has new look.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-10T18:19:15Z,"Comment Siri got a makeover at Apple’s WWDC 2024 in Cupertino, courtesy of the tech giant’s overarching generative AI push this year, called Apple Intelligence. Siri is now more natural, more relevant and more personal — and it has a new look, including a revamped icon. The assistant pops up with a glowing light that wraps around the edges of your device’s screen. Thanks to Apple Intelligence, Siri can now handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. You can now also type to Siri, and it can answer questions about how to use your iPhone, iPad and Mac. Soon, Siri will become even more capable with onscreen awareness. For example, if a friend sends you their address, you’ll be able to ask Siri to do something like “add this address to contact card” and it’ll take care of it (assuming the feature works as advertised). Siri will also have the ability to take action in and across apps, so you can ask Siri to “make this photo pop” and then “add this photo” to another app. That’s thanks to the new App Intents API, which allows devs to let Siri take actions in their apps, and the upgraded Siri’s awareness of personal context including messages, calendar events, files and photos. The capabilities are quite deep. Apple gave the example of Siri finding a photo of your license, extracting your ID number and entering it into a web form for you. It’s not clear when, exactly, we can expect to see many of Siri’s more powerful features land on devices. And Apple Intelligence will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and devices with M1 or newer chips. Hopefully we’ll learn more as WWDC continues.

As earlier rumors suggested, the new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences. “Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted. “And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.” The company has been pushing the feature as integral to all of its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, visionOS. “It has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,” Cook said. “It has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences. Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.” SVP Craig Federighi added, “Apple Intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.” The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps. The system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version of Apple silicon. “Many of these models run entirely on device,” Federighi claimed during the event. That said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data. Apple Intelligence also includes what is likely the biggest update to Siri since it was announced more than a decade ago. The company says the feature is “more deeply integrated” into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use. Siri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It’s an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems.  App Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly. The offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won’t have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example. Apple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company’s apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third-party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini. The company is even bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji (yep, that’s the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a stand-alone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API. Image Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it’s Apple’s take on Google’s Circle to Search, only focused on images.  Search has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promises more natural language searches inside of these applications. The GenAI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia and visionOS 2. It’s available for free with those updates. The feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip. As expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. The GPT 4.0-powered feature utilizes that company’s image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though they can still upgrade to premium). That’s arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it will also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn’t offer much detail. It seems likely that Google’s Gemini is near the top of that list.

17,Ivan Mehta,The apps that Apple Sherlocked at WWDC,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/the-apps-that-apple-sherlocked-at-wwdc/,"Here's a list of third-party apps that were Sherlocked by Apple at this year's WWDC. 
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-12T08:16:42Z,"Comment Apple has been on a spree of late, announcing a host of new features for its various devices earlier this week at WWDC 2024.  But a lot of those features were already available to some extent on Apple devices through third-party apps. So, just like the past few years, we will examine the ideas that Apple “sherlocked” in this year’s updates. But what do we mean that Apple “sherlocked” something? In the late ’90s, Apple launched a search app named Sherlock for macOS 8 that you could use to search the web and files on local systems. Now, a company called Karelia Software already had a $29 search app called Watson, with features like plug-ins for better internet search. In 2002, Apple released Sherlock 3 with features similar to Watson, making Karelia’s app redundant. Since then, people in tech circles have used the term “sherlocking” whenever they want to refer to a new feature from Apple that does the same thing as an existing third-party app. Sherlocked apps: 1Password, LastPass, BitWarden, Proton Pass Apple is launching a new stand-alone password manager for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, visionOS, and Windows. You did have a password manager until now, but it was contained inside a submenu in the Settings app. This new app will essentially do the same thing as third-party password managers, which might see fewer new users, as some people might just choose to use the in-built password manager now. However, most third-party apps in this space also offer apps and integrations across Android, Windows and Linux and can store other information like addresses and credit cards. Sherlocked apps: TapeACall, Truecaller Apple has finally introduced native call recording and transcription inside the Phone app. While apps like TapeACall and Turecaller have offered call recording for a while now, you had to call another number to activate that. The is because Apple didn’t allow third-party companies to access its calling stack. Sherlocked apps: Otter, AudioPen, Voicenotes.com Apart from call transcription, Apple will also offer voice transcription in apps like Notes with the upcoming updates. This takes up the space that apps like Otter, AudioPen, and Voicenotes.com had occupied so far. Still, third-party apps can do various other things — Otter, for instance, is great for transcribing meetings and video calls, and the AudioPen and Voicenotes.com offer AI-supported summaries and formatting capabilities. So users will have to choose how much functionality they want out of voice transcription services. Sherlocked app: Bezel Apple’s new updates will bring the ability to mirror your iPhone on Mac, letting you control your phone remotely. Users will be able to get iPhone notifications on your Mac device, and easily drag and drop files, photos and videos between devices. So far, you had to use Bezel to do this, but it required plugging in your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch using a cable to mirror the device. The app’s developer has said that with Apple’s update on the horizon, they will evaluate their next steps. Including what we had on the roadmap for the next months. Not sure how to feel about Apple getting into this space, it's part of the game, raises the bar, it excites me and makes me sad at the same time. Sherlocked apps: Magnet, Rectangle This isn’t exactly a revolutionary feature since Windows and Linux have let you tile windows for years now. On Macs, you had to use third-party apps like Magnet and Rectangle to get the operating system to easily arrange windows in different ways. Apple is finally baking in this feature into the upcoming macOS Sequoia, but third-party apps might still be able to retain their users by offering better customization features like different size options for windows, the ability to rearrange workspaces with one shortcut, hiding windows on the edge of the screen, and pinning an app to a side. Sherlocked app: Newji Another upcoming feature is the ability to create new emoji using prompts and the new AI engine. You can type in prompts like “A fox as a DJ” to create a new emoji. Until now, you could use an app called Newji to do the same thing. 🪦 RIP Newjihttps://t.co/52uZbU9meM #wwdc24 pic.twitter.com/0dpB7N5jMa Sherlocked app: Alltrails Apple Maps is getting an update as part of iOS 18 that will let U.S.-based users explore national park trails, create custom routes, and save them for offline use. You had to use AllTrails to do all of that, but this app’s advantage might be that it already has a community. Plus, it offers routes beyond national parks in other countries, too. It’s worth remembering that Apple has to strike a balance here: It has to keep up with the competition from Google and Microsoft, while also making money from the App Store, so it can’t just add features that kill off third-party apps altogether. That said, some of these sherlocked apps might survive by offering customized or enterprise solutions, but some small-scale indie apps will eventually lose users to Apple. One curious anomaly this time is Apple’s Writing Tools suite, which is being powered by the company’s AI. The App Store currently has dozens of email and note-taking apps that let you change the tone of a written passage, rewrite it, reformat it altogether, or summarize some text. You may even count Grammarly as a sherlocked app now that Apple is providing proofreading features as well. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Users will be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When an app is locked, if someone tries to tap the phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. While the app lock feature is enabled, information from inside the app won’t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Users can also hide an app that they don’t want others to know is installed. The hidden apps appear in a hidden, locked folder. iOS 18 will also finally let people customize icons and unlock them from the grid.

19,Romain Dillet,Apple unveils iOS 18 with more customization options,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-ios-18-with-more-customization-options/,"Apple is sharing the first details for the upcoming major release of iOS, its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. The company is holding its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week, and it starts with an online conference focused o…",2024-06-10T17:23:50Z,"Comment Apple shared the first details for the upcoming major release of iOS, its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone, at WWDC 2024.  As expected, this is a pivotal moment for the mobile platform as iOS 18 is going to focus on artificial intelligence. “I’m excited that we’ll introduce profound new intelligence capabilities that we hope will inspire developers, delight users, and make our platforms even smarter and more useful than ever,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during its introduction of the event. Later in the presentation, Apple announced that it is integrating ChatGPT into Siri and other system-wide interactions. But before talking about AI, Apple mentioned new customization features. Icons can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don’t hide your background photos. “iOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,” said Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi. Icons can be customized with a tint color. For instance, if you want all your icons to look yellow, you can tint all app icons to this color. Control Center is also getting an update. It isn’t limited to just the buttons you see on the main control center page. You can swipe down to view media playback and home controls. You can also edit Control Center from Control Center directly by tapping on an edit button in a corner. There is a new set of APIs for Control Center, meaning that third-party developers will be able to create Control Center and lock screen shortcuts. For instance, Apple showed that you can replace the camera button on the lock screen with a Snapchat button. Apps can now be individually locked. This way, you need to identify with Face ID, Touch ID or your passcode to unlock this app. This app also doesn’t appear in search results. Being able to hide apps will be important for AI features, too. Messages are getting a much welcome update to tapbacks. You can now react to messages with any emoji or sticker and they’ll appear in color (pretty much like in every other messaging apps). You’ll be able to send messages later and format text (underline, strikethrough, etc.). Apple is also adding RCS support to iOS 18. It was previously announced but the timeline was unclear. As a reminder, RCS is an update to the SMS protocol with more features, such as native group support. Mail will also get new categories, a bit like Gmail categories so that promotions, newsletters and other transactional emails are hidden from your inbox. There’s also a new digest view that pulls all the relevant emails you’ve received, such as your flight information before heading to the airport. Calendar is receiving a small update with an optional integration with Reminders. You can decide to view reminders directly in your calendar. Wallet is getting new capabilities. You can Tap to Cash to pay someone back by holding your phone together. It uses Apple Cash behind the scenes to charge your card and send the money to your friend or family member. Event cards are receiving an update with more information about your event, such as a stadium map. Journal, the recently introduced journaling app is receiving an update with insights and a new way to quickly find past entries. Game mode, a special mode that boosts device performances, is coming to the iPhone. It’s no longer limited to macOS. The Photos app is receiving its annual update but this one is bigger than usual. It’s a complete redesign with a unified, single view. You get the good old photo grid at the top with years and months filters. There are buttons to filter out screenshots, zoom in and zoom out. It should be a bit easier to understand than the old design. Below the grid, when you scroll down, you access collections that you can browse by topic: people, trips, favorite memories, etc. These memories were already available but hidden in a separate tab. But you can now reorganize collections, create pinned collections and customize the app to your favorite photos. If you swipe left, you get an autoplaying video of favorite photos and videos. Apple is calling it the carousel and there will be new favorite moments to watch every day. While this isn’t exactly an iOS 18 feature, the next release of macOS is going to feature iPhone mirroring. If you’re a Mac owner, you’ll be able to mirror your iPhone screen to your Mac. You can interact with your iPhone using your trackpad and keyboard. iOS notifications will also show up on your Mac. All those new features are nice quality-of-life updates, but they only tell part of the story around iOS 18. Apple also unveiled Apple Intelligence at WWDC, its new “personal intelligence system” that will be used across all of Apple’s platforms. “We’re tremendously excited about the power of generative models, and there are already some really impressive chat tools out there that perform a vast array of tasks using world knowledge, but these tools know very little about you or your needs,” Federighi said. Apple Intelligence will enable your iPhone to understand languages and images on your device. It will be able to take actions based on your personal context. And it starts with a new notification system. Your iPhone prioritizes your notifications that are more important. There’s a new smart focus mode that also lets you device decide to hide notifications automatically. But it expands to many areas of the operating system. If you’re writing something in Notes, Mail, Pages or third-party apps, Apple Intelligence can also help you write more clearly and make less mistakes. It’s a system-wide writing tool that helps you communicate more effectively by rewriting your text. Apple showed a cover letter as an example but users can also select a large block of text and ask Apple Intelligence to summarize the text. In the Mail app, you can generate smart replies without having to type anything. Apple Intelligence will ask you basic questions, such as if you want to go this event or not. In the email list, Apple is rewriting  the email previews to summarize the content of the email in just a couple of lines. There is a new feature to summarize the content of your inbox too. Apple intelligence also adds new capabilities for images, from photos to emojis and GIFs. You can create AI-generated images with your friends and family members (just like Easel, a third-party app created by former Snap engineers and that we covered). It is based on the photos on your device and you can select between different styles, such as animation movie or illustration. The company also unveiled Genmoji. These are emojis that you generate with a prompt and you can use in the Messages app. You can also generate emojis that look like your friends based on your photo library. These AI-generated images will live in a new Image Playground. It will be available as an overlay on top of your app, such as Messages. But Apple is also going to ship a dedicated Image Playground app. Third-party developers will also be able to access and play with this Image Playground. Photo editing in the Photos app has also been updated with a new AI-powered cleanup tool. These new AI capabilities also let you search through your library to find something very specific — it could be something that happens in the middle of a video. Of course, Apple Intelligence will also boost Siri’s capabilities. You can say things like “find this file that Arthur shared with me last week” or “show me photos of Tim and me”. While Siri has been around for many years, it’s not great. Apple is also updating Siri’s design. When you talk to Siri, it adds a line around your screen to show that you’re talking to Siri without hiding anything on your screen. You can get a weather pop-up, create an event or get instructions to send emails at a later date. Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions in and across apps. For instance, you can find an old photo from a family trip, tell Siri to make it pop more and add it to a note without touching your device. It’s a new interaction method based on App Intents, a framework that is already used for Siri, Shortcuts and other automation features. Third-party developers can build their own App Intents. It will be interesting to test this new version of Siri when it’s available; the demos worked well in Apple’s prerecorded video. If you want to type with Siri, you can double tap the multitasking line at the bottom of the phone to pull up a conversation with Siri. This could be useful for multi-step requests like in ChatGPT. Apple said that the company has built a ChatGPT integration powered by the GPT-4 model. It is built into Siri and the new system-wide writing tools. You’ll need to accept to share information with OpenAI when you want to talk to ChatGPT. All of Apple Intelligence’s feature will be available for free for now if you have an iPhone 15 Pro or later. You don’t need to create an OpenAI account to use the feature, but you can log in to unlock ChatGPT Plus features. The company says that it plans to integrate with other models in the future.

20,Brian Heater,Apple Watch is finally adding a feature I’ve been requesting for years,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/apple-watch-is-finally-adding-a-feature-ive-been-requesting-for-years/,"The ability to pause your activity rings is a minor feature update for most, but for those of us who obsess about such things to an unhealthy degree, it’s the best Apple Watch update in years.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-11T23:41:17Z,"Comment It’s always fascinating to see what excites people during keynotes. There are the usual marquee items that make the biggest headlines. This week at WWDC 2024, that prize went to Apple Intelligence. Often, however, it’s the smaller items a presenter opts to breeze through that really fire people up. The arrival of Calculator for the iPad got the biggest pre-AI pop of the event. Even before the company showcased its impressive equation-solving features, the mere mention of the app got the crowd riled up. Sometimes delayed gratification is enough. As surprised as I am to admit it, the most exciting non-AI news came during the watchOS segment. It’s something that I’ve been requesting from Apple for several years, fueled by my own health struggles and the fact that I’ve somehow managed to contract COVID four times so far. The ability to pause your activity rings is a minor feature update for most, but for those of us who obsess about such things to an unhealthy degree, it’s the best Apple Watch update in years. If you’re down due to a cold, on an international flight, or find that you’re vigorously shaking your wrist at 9 p.m. just to finish closing your rings, you can pause progress via the Watch or through the connected iPhone app. There are several options for pausing: You can do it for one day, by day of the week or for entire months at a time. The system will still collect your metrics, but if you fail to reach the number that would normally close your ring, you won’t lose your streak. WatchOS 11 brings further ring customization, allowing you to adjust your goals by day. If, for example, you use Sunday as a recovery day for marathon training, you can lower the exercise goal. Once entered, this will be the goal for that day of the week until it’s changed again. Mostly, though, I’m just excited I won’t have to get in 30 minutes of exercise when I inevitably get COVID for the fifth time. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

21,Brian Heater,Why Apple is taking a small model approach to generative AI,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/why-apple-is-taking-a-small-model-approach-to-generative-ai/,"It’s a very Apple approach in the sense that it prioritizes a frictionless user experience above all.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-11T22:51:14Z,"Featured Article Comment Among the biggest questions surrounding models like ChatGPT, Gemini and Midjourney since launch is what role (if any) they’ll play in our daily lives. It’s something Apple is striving to answer with its own take on the category, Apple Intelligence, which was officially unveiled this week at WWDC 2024. The company led with flash at Monday’s presentation; that’s just how keynotes work. When SVP Craig Federighi wasn’t skydiving or performing parkour with the aid of some Hollywood (well, Cupertino) magic, Apple was determined to demonstrate that its in-house models were every bit as capable as the competition’s. The jury is still out on that question, with the betas having only dropped Monday, but the company has since revealed some of what makes its approach to generative AI different. First and foremost is scope. Many of the most prominent companies in the space take a “bigger is better” approach to their models. The goal of these systems is to serve as a kind of one-stop shop to the world’s information. Apple’s approach to the category, on the other hand, is grounded in something more pragmatic. Apple Intelligence is a more bespoke approach to generative AI, built specifically with the company’s different operating systems at their foundation. It’s a very Apple approach in the sense that it prioritizes a frictionless user experience above all. Apple Intelligence is a branding exercise in one sense, but in another, the company prefers the generative AI aspects to seamlessly blend into the operating system. It’s completely fine — or even preferred, really — if the user has no concept of the underlying technologies that power these systems. That’s how Apple products have always worked. The key to much of this is creating smaller models: training the systems on a customized dataset designed specifically for the kinds of functionality required by users of its operating systems. It’s not immediately clear how much the size of these models will affect the black box issue, but Apple thinks that, at the very least, having more topic-specific models will increase the transparency around why the system makes specific decisions. Due to the relatively limited nature of these models, Apple doesn’t expect that there will be a huge amount of variety when prompting the system to, say, summarize text. Ultimately, however, the variation from prompt to prompt depends on the length of the text being summarized. The operating systems also feature a feedback mechanism into which users can report issues with the generative AI system. While Apple Intelligence is much more focused than larger models, it can cover a spectrum of requests, thanks to the inclusion of “adapters,” which are specialized for different tasks and styles. Broadly, however, Apple’s is not a “bigger is better” approach to creating models, as things like size, speed and compute power need to be taken into account — particularly when dealing with on-device models. Opening up to third-party models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT makes sense when considering the limited focus of Apple’s models. The company trained its systems specifically for the macOS/iOS experience, so there’s going to be plenty of information that is out of its scope. In cases where the system thinks a third-party application would be better suited to provide a response, a system prompt will ask whether you want to share that information externally. If you don’t receive a prompt like this, the request is being processed with Apple’s in-house models. This should function the same with all external models Apple partners with, including Google Gemini. It’s one of the rare instances where the system will draw attention to its use of generative AI in this way. The decision was made, in part, to squash any privacy concerns. Every company has different standards when it comes to collecting and training on user data. Requiring users to opt-in each time removes some of the onus from Apple, even if it does add some friction into the process. You can also opt-out of using third-party platforms systemwide, though doing so would limit the amount of data the operating system/Siri can access. You cannot, however, opt-out of Apple Intelligence in one fell swoop. Instead, you will have to do so on a feature by feature basis. Whether the system processes a specific query on device or via a remote server with Private Cloud Compute, on the other hand, will not be made clear. Apple’s philosophy is that such disclosures aren’t necessary, since it holds its servers to the same privacy standards as its devices, down to the first-party silicon they run on. One way to know for certain whether the query is being managed on- or off-device is to disconnect your machine from the internet. If the problem requires cloud computing to solve, but the machine can’t find a network, it will throw up an error noting that it cannot complete the requested action. Apple is breaking down the specifics surrounding which actions will require cloud-based processing. There are several factors at play there, and the ever-changing nature of these systems means something that could require cloud compute today might be able to be accomplished on-device tomorrow. On-device computing won’t always be the faster option, as speed is one of the parameters Apple Intelligence factors in when determining where to process the prompt. There are, however, certain operations that will always be performed on-device. The most notable of the bunch is Image Playground, as the full diffusion model is stored locally. Apple tweaked the model so it generates images in three different house styles: animation, illustration and sketch. The animation style looks a good bit like the house style of another Steve Jobs-founded company. Similarly, text generation is currently available in a trio of styles: friendly, professional and concise. Even at this early beta stage, Image Playground’s generation is impressively quick, often only taking a couple of seconds. As for the question of inclusion when generating images of people, the system requires you to input specifics, rather than simply guessing at things like ethnicity. Apple’s models are trained on a combination of licensed datasets and by crawling publicly accessible information. The latter is accomplished with AppleBot. The company’s web crawler has been around for some time now, providing contextual data to applications like Spotlight, Siri and Safari. The crawler has an existing opt-out feature for publishers. “With Applebot-Extended,” Apple notes, “web publishers can choose to opt out of their website content being used to train Apple’s foundation models powering generative AI features across Apple products, including Apple Intelligence, Services, and Developer Tools.” This is accomplished with the inclusion of a prompt within the website’s code. With the advent of Apple Intelligence, the company has introduced a second prompt, which allows sites to be included in search results but excluded for generative AI model training. Apple released a whitepaper on the first day of WWDC titled, “Introducing Apple’s On-Device and Server Foundation Models.” Among other things, it highlights principles governing the company’s AI models. In particular, Apple highlights four things: Apple’s bespoke approach to foundational models allows the system to be tailored specifically to the user experience. The company has applied this UX-first approach since the arrival of the first Mac. Providing as frictionless an experience as possible serves the user, but it should not be done at the expense of privacy. This is going to be a difficult balancing act the company will have to navigate as the current crop of OS betas reach general availability this year. The ideal approach is to offer up as much — or little — information as the end user requires. Certainly there will be plenty of people who don’t care, say, whether or not a query is executed on-machine or in the cloud. They’re content to have the system default to whatever is the most accurate and efficient. For privacy advocates and others who are interested in those specifics, Apple should strive for as much user transparency as possible — not to mention transparency for publishers that might prefer not to have their content sourced to train these models. There are certain aspects with which the black box problem is currently unavoidable, but in cases where transparency can be offered, it should be made available upon users’ request.

22,Sarah Perez,Apple’s Spotlight Search gets better at natural language queries in iOS 18,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/apples-spotlight-search-gets-better-at-natural-language-queries-in-ios-18/,"With the Core Spotlight framework, developers can donate content they want to make searchable via Spotlight.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-13T17:33:48Z,"Comment Even as Apple embraces AI in iOS 18, it’s working to improve users’ ability to get answers in a more traditional way: through its Spotlight Search feature. Accessed by swiping down on the middle of the Home Screen, Spotlight Search already helps iPhone users discover things on their device and on the web — the latter as an alternative to using Google Search. With iOS 18, Apple is making it easier for people to discover the content inside their apps using natural language — or “semantic” — queries. Already, Spotlight has been able to search for content in developers’ apps, but it would only return results when search terms matched exactly. With this year’s addition of semantic search capabilities, people will be able to search for content in apps using search terms that are similar in meaning, Apple told developers at WWDC 2024 this week. With the Core Spotlight framework, developers can donate content they want to make searchable via Spotlight, which is stored in a private index on users’ devices that other apps cannot access. With the new semantic capabilities, Spotlight’s understanding of developers’ content will be much improved as users will be able to search for content inside apps in their own way. These types of search queries leverage machine learning models that are downloaded to the device and run in the app’s process and can be loaded or unloaded at any time, Apple said. In addition, as Spotlight search is used, developers can help to improve the rankings of their app’s search results over time by sending signals to Spotlight when an iPhone owner engages with one of their results.  For example, if someone were searching for a particular local hiking trail, the semantic search capabilities would be able to find results related to the user’s search query, using entities it understood like the trail’s location or specific keywords, even if they weren’t in the trail’s name and were not exact matches. Plus, the developer can set higher priorities for some of their content, as needed. This allows them to do things like mark a trail that a user had saved as a favorite to rank higher in the search results. The end result is that the person searches for a given trail using a natural language query in Spotlight, finds the trail they want more easily via these improved results, then can tap on a result to be taken straight to the trail’s page in the developer’s hiking trails app. This update also helps Siri better understand an app’s content, Apple noted.  While not as exciting as an AI-powered Siri or ChatGPT integration, this type of under-the-hood update will make for an improved experience for iPhone users who turn to Spotlight to find information from their apps — or even for those who use Spotlight as an alternative to web search.

23,Devin Coldewey,Apple joins the race to find an AI icon that makes sense,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/15/apple-joins-the-race-to-find-an-ai-icon-that-makes-sense/,"No one knows what AI looks like, or even is supposed to look like. It does everything, but looks like nothing.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-15T18:01:00Z,"Comment This week was an exciting one for the AI community, as Apple joined Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta and others in the long-running competition to find an icon that even remotely suggests AI to users. And like everyone else, Apple has punted. Apple Intelligence is represented by a circular shape made up of seven loops. Or is it a circle with a lopsided infinity symbol inside? No, that’s New Siri, powered by Apple Intelligence. Or is New Siri when your phone glows around the edges? Yes. The thing is, no one knows what AI looks like, or even what it is supposed to look like. It does everything but looks like nothing. Yet it needs to be represented in user interfaces so people know they’re interacting with a machine learning model and not just plain old searching, submitting, or whatever else. Although approaches differ to branding this purportedly all-seeing, all-knowing, all-doing intelligence, they have coalesced around the idea that the avatar of AI should be non-threatening, abstract, but relatively simple and non-anthropomorphic. (They seem to have rejected my suggestion that these models always speak in rhyme.) Early AI icons were sometimes little robots, wizard hats or magic wands: novelties. But the implication of the first is one of inhumanity, rigidity and limitation — robots don’t know things, they aren’t personal to you, they perform predefined, automated tasks. And magic wands and the like suggest irrational invention, the inexplicable, the mysterious — perhaps fine for an image generator or creative sounding board, but not for the kind of factual, reliable answers these companies want you to believe AI provides. Corporate logo design is generally a strange concoction of strong vision, commercial necessity and compromise-by-committee. And you can see these influences at work in the logos pictured here. The strongest vision goes, for better or worse, to OpenAI’s black dot. A cold, featureless hole that you throw your query into, it’s a bit like a wishing well or Echo’s cave. Biggest committee energy goes, unsurprisingly, to Microsoft, whose Copilot logo is effectively indescribable. But notice how four of the six (five of seven if you count Apple twice, and why shouldn’t we) use pleasant candy colors: colors that mean nothing but are cheery and approachable, leaning toward the feminine (as such things are considered in design language) or even the childlike. Soft gradients into pink, purple and turquoise; pastels, not hard colors; four are soft, never-ending shapes; Perplexity and Google have sharp edges, but the former suggests an endless book while the latter is a happy, symmetrical star with welcoming concavities. Some also animate in use, creating the impression of life and responsivity (and draw the eye, so you can’t ignore it — looking at you, Meta). Overall, the impression intended is one of friendliness, openness and undefined potential — as opposed to aspects like, for example, expertise, efficiency, decisiveness or creativity. Think I’m overanalyzing? How many pages do you think the design treatment documents ran for each of these logos — over or under 20 pages? My money would be on the former. Companies obsess over these things. (Yet somehow miss a hate symbol dead center, or create an inexplicably sexual vibe.) The point, however, is not that corporate design teams do what they do, but that no one has managed to hit on a visual concept that unambiguously says “AI” to the user. At best these colorful shapes communicate a negative concept: that this interface is not email, not a search engine, not a note app. Email logos often figure as an envelope because they are (obviously) electronic mail, both conceptually and practically. A more general “send” icon for messages is pointed, sometimes divided, like a paper plane, indicating a document in motion. Settings use a gear or wrench, suggesting tinkering with an engine or machine. These concepts apply across languages and (to some extent) generations. Not every icon can allude so clearly to its corresponding function. How does one indicate “download,” for instance, when the word differs between cultures? In France, one telécharges, which makes sense but isn’t really “download.” Yet we have arrived at a downward-pointing arrow, sometimes touching down on a surface. Load down. Same with cloud computing — we adopted the cloud despite it being, essentially, a marketing term for “a big datacenter somewhere.” But what was the alternative, a tiny datacenter button? AI is still new to consumers who are being asked to use it in place of “other things,” a highly general category that purveyors of AI products are loath to define, since to do so would imply that there are some things AI can do and some it can’t. They are not ready to admit this: The whole fiction depends on AI being able to do anything in theory, it being but a matter of engineering and compute to achieve it. In other words, to paraphrase Steinbeck: Every AI considers itself as a temporarily embarrassed AGI. (Or I should say, is considered by its marketing department, since AI itself, as pattern generator, considers nothing.) In the meantime, these companies must still call it by a name and give it a “face” — though it is telling, and refreshing, that no one actually chose a face. But even here they are at the whim of consumers, who ignore GPT version numbers as an oddity, preferring to say ChatGPT; who can’t make the connection with “Bard” but acquiesce to the focus-tested “Gemini”; who never wanted to Bing things (and certainly not talk to the thing) but don’t mind having a Copilot. Apple, for its part, has taken the shotgun approach: You ask Siri to query Apple Intelligence (two different logos), which occurs within your Private Cloud Compute (unrelated to iCloud), or perhaps even forward your request to ChatGPT (no logo permitted), and your best clue that an AI is listening to what you’re saying is … swirling colors, somewhere or everywhere on the screen. Until AI is itself a bit better defined, we can expect icons and logos representing it to continue to be vague, unthreatening, abstract shapes.

Sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility! Kirsten Korosec is still off on holiday, so you’ve got me once again! Today is the big Tesla shareholder vote. We’ll finally get to learn, among other things, whether investors think Elon Musk deserves his $56 billion pay package. And if they don’t, will Musk make good on his threats and leave Tesla so he can focus on xAI or SpaceX or just X?! You’ve probably seen the breathless and thirsty pleas from Tesla board members, shareholders and Musk himself asking investors to vote in favor of the compensation package. Musk and his supporters have claimed that he is owed such astronomical wealth because he hit whatever agreed-upon targets they say he hit. But before the shareholder vote commences, we think it’s worth a second look at why Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick struck down the “re-ratification” of the package in January.  Her dominant theme? Musk holds so much sway over Tesla and its board of directors that there was no substantial negotiation when the company hammered out this deal with him in 2017-2018. We’ll be watching and reporting, so check back in for updates.  — Rebecca Bellan A little bird came to senior reporter Sean O’Kane and told him that Ford was poaching employees at EV startup Canoo. That led O’Kane down the rabbit hole of LinkedIn, where he learned Ford has been quite busy scooping up talent across competitors and tech giants like Rivian, Tesla, Formula 1 and Apple. The upshot? Ford is capitalizing on the recent chaos in the auto industry to build out its secretive low-cost EV team.  Got a tip for us?

General Motors is giving Cruise an $850 million lifeline as the robotaxi company slowly starts re-entering markets. The money is sort of a bridge to help Cruise fund its daily operations until it can “find the right long-term capital efficient strategy, including new partnerships and external funding.”  While this does seem like a large capital outlay, particularly since GM has already invested over $8 billion in Cruise, that $850 million is hundreds of millions lower than the automaker likely would have spent on Cruise this year. GM told investors at the end of last year that it would slash spending on Cruise following a series of safety incidents that culminated in Cruise grounding its entire fleet in November 2023. Other deals that got my attention … Descartes, a logistics company, has acquired BoxTop Technologies, a provider of shipment management solutions for small- to midsized logistics service providers for $13 million, the company told TechCrunch via email. FLO, an EV charging network operator, has secured $136 million in long-term capital, mainly from a Series E round led by Export Development Canada. The funds will help FLO accelerate deployment of its charging network in the U.S. and Canada and advance the rollout of its new charging products, according to a statement from the startup.  Fly E-Bike, a NYC-based e-bike retailer focused on last-mile food delivery, went public on the Nasdaq last week at an opening price of $4.78 per share. The stock has since dipped nearly 20%. General Motors’ board approved a new share buyback plan to repurchase up to $6 billion of outstanding common stock to create more upside for investors, according to a press release. The automaker also increased its stock dividend 33%, from $0.09 to $0.12 per share, in the first quarter.  Tern AI’s positioning system aims to provide a low-cost alternative to GPS. The startup just raised a $4.4 million seed round from Scout Ventures, Shadow Capital, Bravo Victor VC and Veteran Fund. Belgian transport and logistics management startup Qargo has raised $14 million in a Series A led by Balderton Capital. Qargo’s goal is to help the logistics industry digitize to create efficiencies, reduce costs and bring down emissions.  Autonomous vehicles Aside from scoring funding from GM, Cruise also announced that it’s back in Houston with a small fleet of vehicles. They will have a human safety driver behind the wheel as Cruise slowly and painstakingly revalidates its technology.  May Mobility will launch an autonomous shuttle service in Detroit for residents with disabilities or who are 65 and older. Starting June 20, May will deploy three AVs, two of which are wheelchair-accessible, to help participants get to healthcare facilities, shopping centers, work and social activities.   Waymo issued its second recall after one of its robotaxis in Phoenix drove into a telephone pole. Waymo updated the software on its over 600 vehicles as they returned to the depot for regular maintenance and recharging.  Electric vehicles, charging & batteries Aptera is the perfect example of how crowdfunding can go wrong. The startup raised over $100 million from retail investors who were reeled in by flashy social media campaigns. So far, Aptera has nothing to show for it.  The European Commission has concluded that the Chinese EV industry suffers from unfair subsidization that makes it a threat to EU EV producers. So it’s slapping more tariffs on Chinese EVs. For example, BYD would see a 17.4% duty, Geely’s would be 20%, and SAIC’s a whopping 38.1%. Well, we certainly saw this coming. Fisker has issued its first recall for its troubled Ocean SUV due to problems with the warning lights. The recall comes as Fisker is on the brink of bankruptcy and has cut its workforce to the bone.  Rivian at first seemed like it was a little all over the place. But with the revamped version of its first two consumer vehicles (which you can read more about below!) that are built more efficiently and Rivian’s decision to set aside plans to build a factory in Georgia, the EV startup’s path to survival is becoming more clear. Ride-hail  Revel launched an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hail service in New York City in 2021. Now the company is ditching the employee model in favor of a gig worker model akin to competitors Lyft and Uber. In the process, Revel will have to lay off its 1,000 driver employees.  What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.  Before Kirsten went on holiday, she gave Rivian’s revamped R1T and R1S a drive. Let’s see what she learned.  I recently got behind the wheel of the next-generation Rivian R1T and R1S. For those who want a deep dive, you can read my story about why this refresh matters and what new parts and features customers can expect.  For folks looking for the highlights, here are a few quick notes on some important changes.  The ride quality, specifically the road noise and suspension, are much improved in the next-gen R1 line. The ride quality in the first-generation R1S has been a source of complaints, so this improvement couldn’t not have come at a better time.  I also had a chance to test the advanced driver-assistance system. First-gen R1 vehicles also have ADAS, but this one is supported by lots of new sensors, compute and software. The automaker is calling it the “Rivian Autonomy Platform,” but I won’t be because I’m a stickler for what is and what is not autonomy. This is a hands-on system for now and the driver is always expected to be in control.  That being said, there is a lot of capability here. The perception stack includes 11 cameras, five radars, compute that is 10 times more powerful than what’s in the first-gen vehicles and what the company describes as “AI prediction technology.” And this system comes standard.  Rivian will also offer a premium version of the system, called Rivian Autonomy Platform+. I had a chance to test one feature in this premium version called “Lane Change on Command.” The feature, which is only available on divided highways, will move the vehicle into another lane if the driver hits the signal indicator. The feature worked, although I noticed that it took a moment for the vehicle to settle into the center of the lane.  Rivian says more automated driving features will roll out on this premium system in the months to come.  Correction: Waymo has clarified that its recall did not involve an over-the-air software update.

25,Christine Hall,VC Sheel Mohnot leads $4.3M seed in automated financial reporting fintech InScope,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/sheel-mohnot-inscope-financial-reporting/,"InScope leverages machine learning and large language models to provide financial reporting and auditing processes for mid-market and enterprises.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-12T13:05:00Z,"Comment The financial reporting and auditing process is not often on the list of sexy topics that technology startups want to go after. And yet, when errors are made on financial reports, like the one Lyft had earlier this year, it can have dire consequences for a company. Just ask Lyft. After years of performing reporting and auditing work for companies like Miro, Autodesk, Dropbox, Flexport and Yelp, Mary Antony and Kelsey Gootnick decided reporting and auditing needed some technology love, too. Both come from accounting backgrounds and met each other in 2018 while leading the accounting function at Flexport. They saw firsthand how difficult it was for companies to put together financial statements and disclosures — it can take weeks to months to compile, and many are prone to errors that can have severe consequences for companies if presented incorrectly. So they started San Francisco-based InScope in 2023, leveraging machine learning and large language models to provide financial reporting and auditing processes for mid-market and enterprises. They launched the company in beta in early 2024 to customers who use Oracle NetSuite.  The first iteration of the product included automating GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP reporting, including cash flow statements, CEO Antony said.  “It really looks like a sudoku puzzle that you have to do with trial-and-error to get right,” Antony told TechCrunch. “Cash flow statements are one of the most important metrics for a company, so they shouldn’t be a sudoku puzzle, or a puzzle in general. We make it possible for our customers to have effortless, but accurate and reliable financial statements every time.”  Along with the cash flow statements, the company will release a feature later this year that helps customers draft annual and quarterly financial reports, Antony said. InScope’s closest competitor today is Workiva, which also provides finance and audit software. However, Gootnick said Workiva’s product offering is more focused on public companies, whereas InScope focuses on private companies.  Some legacy professional service firms offer similar services that make them indirect competitors, but Antony and Gootnick see InScope’s product really more complementary to them. So much so that they could be customers, Gootnick said. InScope has five early customers, and is in the process of signing an additional six. The company is generating revenue currently and is aiming to grow both 10x in customers and revenue by the end of the year, Antony said.  That growth attracted venture capital investors, which injected $4.3 million in seed capital into the company recently. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from a group of individual investors including Vipul Ved Prakash (founder and CEO of Together AI), Jake Heller (founder and CEO of Casetext), Debbie Clifford (chief financial officer at Autodesk), Justin Coulombe (chief financial officer at Miro) and Nadia Asoyan (chief financial officer at Strike). The founders say their next steps include expanding their customer base to 50 companies by the end of the year and will use the investment to scale its product, grow the team and enhance its AI capabilities. Better Tomorrow Ventures has advised the company since its inception, and InScope was also part of Better Tomorrow’s first accelerator program in 2023. “When we met the team through our accelerator program, we quickly noticed how dedicated and passionate they were to fix a critical component that can be detrimental to a company’s success,” said Sheel Mohnot, co-founder of Better Tomorrow Ventures, in a statement. “After advising the team for a few weeks, we knew that if anyone could tackle this problem, it would be Mary and Kelsey.” Editor’s note, June 12, 8:20 a.m. PST: After publication, the company clarified that new investor Lightspeed led the current round, and Better Tomorrow’s Sheel Mohnot led earlier rounds.

That’s according to Jonathan Sanders, CEO and co-founder of fledgling Danish startup Light, which exits stealth Wednesday with $13 million in a seed round of funding led by European VC giant Atomico. The Copenhagen-based startup is reimagining general ledger software from the ground up, replete with AI to cleanse transactional data, while also enabling finance teams to ask plain-English questions and receive straightforward answers from their data. With stints at companies such as investment bank Credit Suisse and SMB-focused expense management scale-up Pleo, Sanders has reasonable insight into the working environment of the CFO’s office. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is king, packing support for CRM (customer relationship management), HR (human resources), project management, and perhaps the most crucial component of all, the general ledger. A general ledger is an all-encompassing record of a company’s financial transactions, recording every dollar, dime and penny that comes in and out. For the chief financial officer, it’s important, serving as a single source of truth into a company’s financial health. And it’s this element of the ERP that Light is focused on dragging into the modern digital era, where AI increasingly rules the roost. “Our mission is to be the first automated ledger for global companies,” Sanders told TechCrunch. “We believe CFOs and finance teams deserve the full benefits of AI, gaining the full knowledge and expertise of a large enterprise organization when it comes to accounting and taxes, something that they have been denied to date.” Companies integrate Light with their various CRM and HRM tools, their banks and even their communication channels such as Microsoft Teams and Slack. The “AI” in the platform constitutes a mix of models, each serving distinct purposes for the finance fraternity — for example, handling manual tasks such as line-item coding (i.e., assigning codes to individual transactions) or working out correct tax codes and related bookkeeping tasks. “We use one model to help bookkeep all line items with correct taxes and accounts, and we use another model to help the C-suite to ask questions about revenue, costs and profit — directly from Slack,” Sanders said. “We have, and continue to experiment with, a mix of off-the-shelf models and fine-tuned open source models as the AI landscape is changing rapidly.” By unbundling the ERP, Light is giving something of a middle finger to legacy applications such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP ERP and Microsoft Dynamics, while also taking on “younger” upstarts such as Quickbooks and Xero. The company is targeting “multi-entity international companies” with the promise of a unified dashboard for all their global transactions, one that’s “fully searchable and queryable using AI.” The is all the result of Sanders’ own personal frustrations of working with established ERP systems. “I remember one time, I was working with the finance team on some report from the ERP system, and it took the page more than 20 seconds to load — I asked why the Wi-Fi was so slow,” Sanders said. “They said it wasn’t the Wi-Fi that was the problem, it was the product. I immediately knew something had to be done.” On top of that, Sanders also touts a slicker “Apple-like” interface design, one that finance teams might not hate using. The long and short of this is that rather than offering things like CRM, HR or project management, Light only serves features such as accounts receivable (AR), accounts payable (AP), bookkeeping, VAT reporting and more. While having a fully featured ERP makes sense for some businesses — for instance, where there needs to be a tight alignment between sales, supply chain and workforce data (e.g., in manufacturing) — this isn’t the case for many (or even most) businesses today, which are already using stand-alone tools that traditionally existed in an ERP platform. “We’ve chosen to focus on the general ledger to build a clean and focused product — this is the hardest, and most important, problem to solve for modern finance teams,” Sanders said. “Modern companies use the best CRM, like Salesforce, and the best HR software, like Workday or Factorial. But there’s no global ledger that is unbundled from the ERP suite, so you are forced to implement a full-stack ERP with embedded CRM and HRM products you never use.” Sold as a subscription with volume-based pricing, Light also hopes to target a new breed of company weary of legacy software priced on a per-seat basis that ultimately limits access to a select few in the company. Thus, Light is fairly broad in terms of identifying a target market — the only thing that they might have in common is a desire to scale globally. “The primary day-to-day users are finance teams, including the CFO,” Sanders said. “Whether the company is 50 employees or 5,000, they can leverage Light for their global operations. We focused on making the interface with the rest of the business seamless, so anyone with the right permissions can easily approve invoices, upload expenses and query vendor information or reports.” After leaving his position as head of payments at Pleo in 2020, Sanders went on to found another fintech company called Juni, which develops tools to help e-commerce companies manage their finances better. That startup went on to raise north of $280 million, but Sanders left in 2022. He maintains that there was nothing particularly acrimonious about his departure. “We wanted to take the company in different directions — I remain a happy shareholder, cheering from the sidelines,” Sanders said. And so in 2023, Sanders incorporated Light, and although it has been operating in stealth for the past year, the platform is already technically live and available globally. The lion’s share of its current customers hail from the Nordics, including Worksome, Lenus, Famly and Proxify — this is something that Sanders says positions his own company well to thrive. “In the Nordics, as well as in other smaller countries in Europe, companies have to be global from day one,” Sanders said. “This means that as soon as you find commercial traction, you need to open legal entities in other countries and your financial backbone breaks. Our mission is to help these companies early on in their journey to go global and unshackle them from the burdens of existing legacy solutions.” Aside from lead backer Atomico, Light’s seed round also included participation from Cherry Ventures, Entrée Capital, Seedcamp, and angels such as German soccer player Mario Götze.

But starting today, the pair told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview, the San Francisco-based corporate credit card and expense management company is shifting to a more traditional — and what they say should be a more agile — model of just one CEO at the helm. Franceschi will become the sole CEO while Dubugras will become chairman of Brex’s board. In an in-depth conversation, the two co-founders gave us a peek into what the new structure will look like, the company’s current state of finances and how it has managed to reduce its cash burn. The close friends started working together as co-founders of another company, Brazilian payment processing startup Pagar.me, in 2012 at the wee age of 16. (That company ended up getting acquired by Stone Pagamentos for “tens of millions of dollars” — before the two had even gone to college.) While both founders could code, they quickly realized that Franceschi was the “better coder.” Rather than having one person manage a part of the organization like product and engineering and the other one manage sales and marketing, they decided to split their duties as external and internal co-CEOs (a decision they touched on in this episode of the Found podcast last year).  The model worked so well at that company, they said, that they decided to employ the same strategy when they founded Brex after dropping out of Stanford to participate in the YC Winter 2017 cohort. “The upside is that we had twice as much time as other CEOs,” said Dubugras. But now the co-founders believe that having two CEOs could be a bottleneck to the company’s growth by keeping its leadership from making faster decisions. They also feel like when they eventually do go public — something they don’t anticipate doing until 2025 or later — that investors will be more attracted to a traditional model of just one CEO running the company. “I think we’re at a scale where we’re starting to see some of the cracks in the co-CEO model,” Dubugras told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. “After talking, we thought this would help the business succeed. We thought this would enable much faster and better decision-making.” Over the years at Brex, Franceschi led the development of the company’s core financial infrastructure from scratch, which the pair claim allowed Brex “to have great margins and expand faster globally.” He, according to the company, “led the entire organization over the last six years,” helping it grow to more than 30,000 customers (from startups to over 130 publicly traded companies) and a product suite that spans corporate cards, banking, expense management, travel and bill pay. Some of its larger customers include DoorDash, Flexport, Roblox, Compass and Shein, but the bulk of its revenue still comes from startups, the co-founders say. Meanwhile, Dubugras focused more on tasks such as fundraising — the startup has brought in over $1.5 billion in both primary and secondary transactions; its backers include Greenoaks Capital, TCV, Tiger Global Management, Kleiner Perkins, Y Combinator and Global Founders Capital, among others. He also managed relationships with banking partners and regulators and served as the face of Brex “personally selling” to its largest customer “at any moment in time.”   He added: “Each of us had our own responsibilities … [and] we made many decisions together. This worked extremely well when we were smaller, but naturally became harder as we grew.” Dubugras insists he’s still committed to Brex. “I’ll still be involved to the extent that the team wants and needs me involved. Brex remains my main and only thing,” he said. The once high-flying company has been on a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Two years ago, it was valued at $12.3 billion after raising $300 million and had poached former Meta exec Karandeep Anand to serve as its chief product officer after having led Meta’s business products group. (He was then named the first president of the company in November of 2023.) In January, Brex laid off 282 people, or about 20% of its staff. That was after an October 2022 layoff of 136 people, or 11% of its staff, across all departments as part of a restructuring. Today, it has 1,000 workers. There’s also been a lot of shuffling among Brex’s management. Sam Blond left his role as chief revenue officer in 2022 to join Founders Fund (a position he departed in March). Earlier this year, Brex announced that its COO, Michael Tannenbaum, was transitioning from his role to become a board member. At that time, Camilla Morais, who was SVP of global operations, was promoted to COO. And it was announced that Cosmin Nicolaescu was transitioning from his role as CTO to an adviser position this summer. In the note to employees at the time of its layoffs, Franceschi wrote that the company was now “emphasizing long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains” in its comp structure. And then there’s the matter of its finances. The co-founders told TechCrunch that its cash runway is now four years. This counters a January article from The Information around the time of its most recent layoffs wherein Brex reportedly told employees that it burned $17 million a month in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that it only had “enough cash to last through March 2026.” When asked about financials at the time of those layoffs, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that the data was “inaccurate” and directed me to the note announcing the layoffs and wrote: “The changes today are driven by a desire to make Brex more agile and accelerate our path to profitability, building on the growth we had in 2023. We grew our revenue 35%+ in 2023 while gross profit increased by 75%. This reduction in force puts us on a clear path towards profitability.” Of course, laying off workers is a tried-and-true way to reduce spending and improve cash runway. Today, Franceschi told TechCrunch that Brex has cut its cash burn in half over the past year. And while he declined to reveal any revenue figures, he said the company’s goal is to be cash-flow positive by 2025. When asked how the fintech startup had managed to reduce its cash burn, he said there was a combination of factors. For one, Brex has seen increased revenue growth “without increasing fixed costs,” he said. The layoffs from earlier this year “contributed to a lot of the savings” (and he says he doesn’t anticipate any more layoffs). And lastly, the company has worked harder to move faster. “The biggest benefit after the layoff was not just the cost savings. It was the way in which the company operates,” he said. When it comes to revenue, Franceschi said that it’s mostly from interchange, although its software business is growing as startups grow larger and new mid-market and enterprise companies sign on as customers. And there is also the revenue derived from interest and foreign exchange fees. Franceschi said that by offering cash back and rewards, more of its customers are using Brex’s card product, which is in turn generating more interchange revenue. Meanwhile, Brex doesn’t have any plans to do any primary fundraising anytime soon. But it may offer a secondary sale at some point so that before the company goes public, those shareholders who want to cash in can do so without dragging down the stock, Dubugras said. “We don’t want to be a high-volatility public company … [T]hat really distracts from the execution of the company and the core mission,” he added. “I think that one important piece for having a lower volatility public company is being cash-flow positive and making money, which is something that we historically have planned for 2025. So, if that happens in 2025, [an IPO] will be soon after. But we need to get there first.”  No doubt that the expense management space in which Brex operates is an increasingly crowded one — in that it competes with startups such as Ramp, Mercury and Airbase, among others. But it also competes with the likes of American Express, Concur and Citi. Franceschi claims that Brex’s advantage is that it built its tech stack “vertically integrated down to the Mastercard rails and the ACH rails and the money movement rails,” whereas some competitors built their business on top of other platforms such as Stripe or Marqeta. That works for more simple use cases, he said. But for more complex scenarios such as global coverage, depth of integration helps. Still, the competitive landscape remains heated. In April, Ramp announced it had raised another $150 million at a post-money valuation of $7.65 billion. And digital banking startup Mercury in May announced it is layering software onto its bank accounts, giving its business customers the ability to pay bills, invoice customers and reimburse employees. Brex remains undeterred. “A lot of the momentum that we’re seeing now is net new customers coming in on the enterprise side, versus customers at scale with us naturally,” Franceschi said.  Want more fintech news in your inbox?

28,Brian Heater,Watch Apple kick off WWDC 2024 right here,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/watch-apple-kick-off-wwdc-2024-right-here/,"The keynote will be focused on Apple's software offerings and the developers that power them, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS.

For personal use only.",2024-06-07T19:05:00Z,"Comment Apple kicked off its weeklong Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2024) event today with the customary keynote at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT. The presentation focused on the company’s software offerings and the developers that power them, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS. But the biggest news came with the reveal of Apple Intelligence, the company’s big entrance into the competitive AI market. You can watch the archive over on Apple’s events page, or you can watch the YouTube archive right here and via the embed below. And if you’re curious about what the predictions were ahead of the event, all of the pre-event speculation is still captured below that YouTube embed and a couple others highlighting Apple’s reveals. Otherwise, you can head right here for our complete rundown of everything Apple announced during this year’s WWDC. Over the past couple of years, critics have noted that the company has thus far been falling behind the likes of Google, Microsoft and OpenAI when it comes to generative AI research. And our own Ivan Mehta has highlighted the need for them to present AI products that are actually helpful, not flashy keynote demos. CEO Tim Cook has promised to address concerns around AI for some time now, and there’s no better time and place than at Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino during WWDC. Rumors currently point to a potential deal with GPT-developer OpenAI, aimed at leveling the playing field a bit. The latest reports have put a name to Apple’s AI efforts: Apple Intelligence, along with the caveat that not all recent Apple devices will be able to use the new system. And many rumors are swirling around the AI enhancements coming to iOS 18, and a potential second life for Siri. Meanwhile, new hardware has never been a guarantee at the software-focused event, though the company has made it a trend in recent years, courtesy of Apple Silicon updates and last year’s big Vision Pro debut. The most recent rumors, however, suggest that this will be an off-year for hardware, in spite of mounting pressure following a lukewarm reception for Apple’s first swing at mixed reality and the decision to kill its electric car project. Though the centerpiece will be iOS 18, the company will also debut macOS 15, including some big design changes to perhaps the most useful app on the iPhone, Calculator. And you can bet that many of iOS 18’s AI features will make their way to macOS 15, as well. TechCrunch will be reporting on the ground at Apple Park, bringing you the news as it happens.

29,Sarah Perez,AI news reader Particle adds publishing partners and $10.9M in new funding,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/ai-news-reader-particle-adds-publishing-partners-and-10-9m-in-new-funding/,"Particle announced it has partnered with news organization Reuters to collaborate on new business models and experiments in monetization.

For personal use only.",2024-06-11T13:00:00Z,"Comment Traffic is down, newsrooms are undergoing layoffs and publishers fear that AI technologies will only make matters worse. Entering the fray, news-reader startup Particle is teaming up with publishers to seek out a new business model for the AI era, where AI summaries of news don’t have to mean lost revenues. The startup, built by former Twitter engineers, offers a news-reading app that helps readers understand all angles of the story by leveraging AI to summarize news from across a range of publishers. Now, the company is bringing its first publishing partners into the mix to help it guide its next steps.  On Monday, Particle announced it has partnered with news organization Reuters to collaborate on new business models. As a start, Particle now subscribes to Reuters newswire to help it deliver information about current events in the news.  In addition, Particle has closed on $10.9 million in Series A funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, a round that also includes investment from Axel Springer, a global media company and home to brands like Business Insider, Politico, Welt and Bild. The partnerships and investments from media companies intend to show how serious Particle is about working alongside publishers to meet their goals, rather than trying to solve their problems for them. Of course, a focus on publishers’ needs doesn’t necessarily translate into success.  This year, the a16z-backed Twitter alternative Post News shut down, after teaming up with publishers to experiment with the micropayments business model where users would pay small amounts of money to read an article that appears in a Twitter-like feed. Artifact, the news app from Instagram’s co-founders, also recently exited to (TechCrunch parent) Yahoo, after its efforts in leveraging AI to personalize the reading experience and summarize individual stories. However, Particle’s premise is that it will deliver something of value to news consumers, beyond just AI summaries. It also aims to offer a better way to understand the news by analyzing all the different angles of a story using AI.  “Part of Particle’s thesis is … how a story is being reported from all sides of the spectrum,” explained Particle co-founder Sara Beykpour, previously a senior director of product management at Twitter. “We think that’s important.” Beykpour had earlier worked on products like Twitter Blue, Twitter Video and Twitter’s conversations, and had spearheaded the experimental app twttr while working at the company from 2015 through 2021. Her co-founder at Particle is Marcel Molina, a former senior engineer at both Twitter and Tesla. Founded in February 2023, the team had started with a more social focus, given their backgrounds, but within a couple of months narrowed in on news and information, Beykpour said. “We wanted to build an experience for consumers that really helps them cut through the noise and that helps them understand more [and] what’s going on faster, and we want to do that in a way that is a sustainable, win-win situation for both the readers that are consuming and the publishers and the journalists that are producing the content,” she said. Similar to Artifact, Particle will offer a personalized news experience. But to ensure people don’t get stuck in their own “filter bubbles” — that is, reading only those stories that match their existing worldview — Particle will take a different approach to the unit of content. In Particle, that unit is not an individual news article, but the story as a whole, as told by multiple outlets. This allows readers to see a multi-perspective view of a story and then easily click through to the various sources of the reporting. This model also cuts down on duplication, so readers won’t be seeing stories that are essentially the same as one another. Under the hood, Particle uses a mix of AI technologies, including GPT-4o, to summarize the news. For now, Particle is selecting the sources for the stories from across a spectrum of publishers and won’t allow users to input their own sources into the app. That could change in the future, but Particle wants to ensure that readers are still being exposed to multiple viewpoints.  This is an area startups have tried to tackle before. A few years ago, Google engineers tried to fix information overload and media bias with an app called Brief, but it used human editors to summarize news, not AI. Twitter later acqui-hired that team. Earlier, the news app SmartNews also launched a feature that would show articles from across the political spectrum, but it’s not a main driver of downloads. What Particle isn’t yet ready to reveal is its business model. That’s because it hasn’t settled on one yet.  “We want to work with publishers on developing what that new model looks like. That’s one of the reasons we are working with publishers and inviting other publishers and journalists to work with us so that we can develop it together,” Beykpour said. But she said that all ideas are on the table, including revenue sharing, advertising and more. With its Series A, Particle is adding Lightspeed’s Michael Mignano to its board. Other angels now backing Particle include Jason Goldman, Vijaya Gadde, Lakshmi Shankar, Bruce Falck, Shane Mac, Jill Bowen, Mohamad Taha, Roger Sippl and Max Mullen. Prior to its Series A, Particle had raised $4.4 million in seed funding in April 2023, backed by Kindred Ventures, Adverb Ventures and GC&H Investments, as well as various angels, like Twitter and Medium co-founder Ev Williams and Behance founder Scott Belsky. David Brinker, a former VP of content partnerships at Snap, and Tony Haile, the former CEO of digital news startup Scroll (acquired by Twitter), are the company’s official advisers. With the funds, Particle is hiring for key roles including a back-end engineer, SRE, community and editorial lead and a media partnerships lead. Particle’s app is still in private beta testing with a small group on iOS’s TestFlight. In time, it aims to support the web and Android, too.

Dave Burke, VP of engineering at Android, said on Thursday that he is stepping down from the role after 14 years. However, he is not leaving Alphabet and will be exploring “AI/bio” projects within the company. Burke was involved in pivotal projects at Android, including the Nexus and Pixel phones, developing Chrome for mobile phones, starting Android TV, and spearheading efforts to build and ship developer tools. Burke’s move follows a slew of layoffs and restructuring at Alphabet this year. In January, the company laid off more than 1,000 employees, including most of its AR hardware team, and in April, Google combined its hardware and Android teams to focus on bringing AI to all its devices. That latter decision led to Hiroshi Lockheimer, who had headed Android, Chrome and ChromeOS, exploring other roles in the company, and Rick Osterloh, SVP of devices and services, was brought on to oversee the new division. Sameer Samat, who worked under Lockheimer, became the president of Android Ecosystem. In a post on X, Burke said that he would continue as an adviser as he looks for another project. So… after 14 yrs leading Android engineering, I've decided it's time for a change. An awe-inspiring ride helping build the biggest OS on the planet (+ many Nexus/Pixel). I'm forever grateful for the opp. Continuing as advisor while figuring out what's next in AI/bio. More here:… In a letter to his colleagues, which Burke also published on LinkedIn, he said he wanted to explore the role of AI in boosting drug discovery. “AI has the potential to play a pivotal role in accelerating drug discovery, with wide applicability, including in hard-to-treat pediatric cancers, a topic close to my heart. I’m working with Sundar to explore relevant roles at Alphabet,” he said. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

The model will be built from scratch and will be trained exclusively on Getty Images’ licensed creative content. The company says the partnership will enable Picsart subscribers to generate their own unique images, with full commercial rights. Users will be able to use any of Picsart’s editing tools to add to or customize the assets.  By creating its own model trained exclusively on licensed content, Picsart plans to give its users access to safe AI creative tools at a time when there are rising concerns regarding AI-generated images and copyright issues.  Picsart’s AI lab, PAIR, is building the model. The team will make the model accessible through the company’s own API services.  “Picsart offers endless customization, content, and editing tools for everything from social media ads to website graphics, and this partnership will enable commercially usable AI-generated imagery from a world-class brand,” said Picsart CEO and founder Hovhannes Avoyan, in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Getty Images, the most prestigious commercial library out there, to bring this to market.” Picsart plans to launch the model later this year.  The company is also integrating Getty Images video content into Picsart’s platform and making it available to Plus members. Picsart isn’t the first startup that Getty Images has partnered with for responsible AI imagery, as it also partnered with AI image generator Bria, and Runway, a startup building generative AI for content creators.

Search results are based on the Brave Search API and Leo is integrated into the company’s browser. The company said that this integration will help users find more up-to-date information. People can use this integration to fetch information like the latest scores, pull more context related to the topic while reading an article and search recent and relevant topics to create social media posts. Brave emphasized that the integration is privacy-forward because the company doesn’t require users to log in. Plus, it doesn’t store your conversations with the AI chatbot on its server. Brave said it doesn’t use the responses to train its model. The company added that it sends requests to an anonymization server first to hide a user’s identity. You can also purchase Leo Premium at $14.99/month, which gives you higher rate limits and access to the latest models. The company said it issues unlinkable tokens when you buy the subscription to prevent any personal identification.  Brave has tried to build its AI capability to attract more users to its browser and search engine. The company launched AI-powered summarization for its search product last year to show users the gist of answers to a search query. It also made the Leo AI Assistant available to everyone in November 2023. In April, the company introduced an AI Answer engine to search to answer users’ queries. Other browsers such as Edge, Opera, Arc and SigmaOS have integrated AI to varying degrees. Brave likely wants to use its advantage of owning both a browser and search stack to refine its product.

The feature rolled out yesterday on Mac and is available in the latest Arc update with version 1.47.1. The new feature allows you to pin Google Calendar to your favorites section for quick access at any time. Once activated, the “Live Calendar” feature provides countdown timers to remind you right before a meeting starts and a “Join” button to hop on calls with a single click. You can choose how soon you want the reminder to appear in settings.  Other updates released in the newest version of Arc include a less cluttered command bar that eliminates the Shift+Enter icons that pop up after a search and a swipe capability for reopening tabs that you accidentally closed. Additionally, a Picture-in-Picture mode on the Arc Search app enables users to multitask, like online shopping while watching a YouTube video. Arc’s parent company, The Browser Company, is on a mission to build an “internet computer” for users.

35,Sarah Perez,Apple brings Apple Intelligence to developers via SiriKit and App Intents,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-apple-intelligence-to-developers-via-sirikit-and-app-intents/,"Apple Intelligence, Apple’s new generative AI offering, won’t only be a consumer-facing feature — developers will be able to take advantage of the latest technology too. In its keynote address at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday, the company a…",2024-06-10T19:00:26Z,"Comment Apple Intelligence, Apple’s new generative AI offering, won’t just be a consumer-facing feature; developers will be able to take advantage of the latest technology, too. In Apple’s keynote address at WWDC 2024 on Monday, the company announced that developers would be able to integrate the experience powered by Apple Intelligence into their own apps. Apple’s SDKs (software development kits) have been updated with a variety of new APIs and frameworks that will allow app makers to do things like integrate the Image Playground — or GenAI image creation — with just a few lines of code. Apple showed off how an app like Craft could use this offering to make users’ documents more visual by allowing them to add AI images. AI-powered writing tools will also be automatically available in any app that uses the standard editable text view. For this, Apple demonstrated how an app like Bear Notes would automatically be able to allow users to rewrite, proofread and summarize their notes. In addition, Apple is building more ways for developers to take actions in apps with Siri.  Developers who have already adopted SiriKit — an SDK for integrating Siri into their apps — will see immediate enhancements for many of Siri’s new capabilities without any extra work on their part, Apple said. This includes areas like Lists, Notes, Media, Messaging, Payments, Restaurant reservations, VoIP calling and Workouts. In its Developer keynote, Apple said that there are two new Siri capabilities that developers will be able to benefit from without additional work. First, Siri will be able to invoke any item from an app’s menus. That means a user could say something like “show my presenter notes” when in their slide deck or even something more conversational, like “I need to see my speaker notes.” Secondly, Siri will be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple’s standard text systems. This will allow users to reference and act on text on the screen. For instance, if you had a reminder or note to “wish grandpa a happy birthday,” you could just say “FaceTime him” to take action on that note. Meanwhile, Apple’s App Intents framework will also gain access to Apple Intelligence. Apple is defining new intents and making them available to developers across categories starting with a subset of categories including Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards and Word Processors. These intents are defined and tested so they’re easier for developers to adopt, Apple claims.  With the intents, a photo-editing app like Darkroom could leverage the Apply Filter intent so users could just say “Apply a cinematic present to the photo I took of Ian yesterday” to have the app take action. More domains will be added in time. Initially, users will be able to develop with the Shortcuts app but over time, Siri will gain the ability to call the app intents in the supported domains. Plus, Apple shared in its keynote address, apps that fit an existing SiriKit domain will be able to benefit from Siri’s enhanced conversational capabilities, like responding correctly even if you stumble over your words or understanding references to an earlier part of the conversation. Siri will also be able to search data from apps using a new Spotlight API that enables app entities to be included in its index. These entities refer to Apple Intelligence’s semantic index of things like photos, messages, files, calendar events and more. Also on Monday, the company announced its own password-manager app, AI-generated Bitmoji and Calculator for the iPad.

The presentation focused on the company’s software offerings and the developers that power them, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS. But the biggest news came with the reveal of Apple Intelligence, the company’s big entrance into the competitive AI market. You can watch the archive over on Apple’s events page, or you can watch the YouTube archive right here and via the embed below. And if you’re curious about what the predictions were ahead of the event, all of the pre-event speculation is still captured below that YouTube embed and a couple others highlighting Apple’s reveals. Otherwise, you can head right here for our complete rundown of everything Apple announced during this year’s WWDC. Over the past couple of years, critics have noted that the company has thus far been falling behind the likes of Google, Microsoft and OpenAI when it comes to generative AI research. And our own Ivan Mehta has highlighted the need for them to present AI products that are actually helpful, not flashy keynote demos. CEO Tim Cook has promised to address concerns around AI for some time now, and there’s no better time and place than at Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino during WWDC. Rumors currently point to a potential deal with GPT-developer OpenAI, aimed at leveling the playing field a bit. The latest reports have put a name to Apple’s AI efforts: Apple Intelligence, along with the caveat that not all recent Apple devices will be able to use the new system. And many rumors are swirling around the AI enhancements coming to iOS 18, and a potential second life for Siri. Meanwhile, new hardware has never been a guarantee at the software-focused event, though the company has made it a trend in recent years, courtesy of Apple Silicon updates and last year’s big Vision Pro debut. The most recent rumors, however, suggest that this will be an off-year for hardware, in spite of mounting pressure following a lukewarm reception for Apple’s first swing at mixed reality and the decision to kill its electric car project. Though the centerpiece will be iOS 18, the company will also debut macOS 15, including some big design changes to perhaps the most useful app on the iPhone, Calculator. And you can bet that many of iOS 18’s AI features will make their way to macOS 15, as well. TechCrunch will be reporting on the ground at Apple Park, bringing you the news as it happens.

37,Kyle Wiggers,How much does ChatGPT cost? Everything you need to know about OpenAI’s pricing plans,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/15/how-much-does-chatgpt-cost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-openais-pricing-plans/,"OpenAI offers an array of plans for ChatGPT, both paid and free.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-15T15:00:00Z,"Comment OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT keeps expanding with new features. It now offers a store — the GPT Store — for AI-powered applications and services. The recently introduced memories feature lets you save preferences so that chats are more tailored to you. And soon, ChatGPT will gain an upgraded voice mode, letting you interact with the platform more or less in real time. So, you might be wondering: How much does ChatGPT cost? It’s a tougher question to answer than you might think. OpenAI offers an array of plans for ChatGPT, both paid and free, aimed at customers ranging from individuals to nonprofits, small- and medium-sized businesses, educational institutions and enterprises. To keep track of the various ChatGPT subscription options available, we’ve put together a guide on ChatGPT pricing. We’ll keep it updated as new plans are introduced.  Once upon a time, the free version of ChatGPT was quite limited in what it could do. But that’s changed as OpenAI has rolled out new capabilities and underlying generative AI models. ChatGPT free users get access to OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4o model, responses augmented with content from the web, access to the GPT Store and the ability to upload files and photos and ask questions about those uploads. Users can also store chat preferences as “memories” and leverage advanced data analysis, a ChatGPT feature that can “reason over” (i.e., analyze data from) files such as spreadsheets and PDFs. There are downsides that come with the free ChatGPT plan, however, including daily capacity limits on the GPT-4o model, depending on demand. Once a user reaches the limits, they’re switched automatically — albeit temporarily — to OpenAI’s less-capable GPT-3.5 model. ChatGPT free users also miss out on certain data analysis features, which we discuss in greater detail below. For individual users who want a more capable ChatGPT, there’s ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per month.  ChatGPT Plus offers 5x higher capacity than ChatGPT free, plus early and priority access to newer tools like OpenAI’s macOS client for ChatGPT. In addition, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get an upgraded data analysis feature, underpinned by GPT-4o, that can create interactive charts and tables from datasets. Users can upload the files to be analyzed directly from Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive or from their devices. Say you own a small business or manage an org and want more than one ChatGPT license, plus collaborative features. ChatGPT Team might fit the bill: It costs $30 per user per month or $25 per user per month billed annually for up to 149 users. ChatGPT Team provides a dedicated workspace and admin tools for team management. All users in a ChatGPT Team plan gain access to OpenAI’s latest models and the aforementioned tools that let ChatGPT analyze, edit and extract info from files. Beyond this, ChatGPT Team lets people within a team build and share custom apps — similar to the apps in the GPT Store — based on OpenAI models. These apps can be tailored for specific use cases or departments, or tuned on a team’s data. Large organizations — any organization in need of more than 149 ChatGPT licenses, to be specific — can opt for ChatGPT Enterprise, OpenAI’s corporate-focused ChatGPT plan. OpenAI doesn’t publish the price of ChatGPT Enterprise, but the reported cost is around $60 per user per month with a minimum of 150 users and a 12-month contract. ChatGPT Enterprise adds “enterprise-grade” privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options. There’s a dedicated workspace and admin console with tools to manage how employees within an organization use ChatGPT, including integrations for single sign-on, domain verification and a dashboard showing usage and engagement statistics.  Shareable conversation templates provided as a part of ChatGPT Enterprise allow users to build internal workflows and bots leveraging ChatGPT, while credits to OpenAI’s API platform let companies create fully custom ChatGPT-powered solutions if they choose.  ChatGPT Enterprise customers also get priority access to models and lines to OpenAI expertise, including a dedicated account team, training, and consolidated invoicing. And they’re eligible for Business Associate Agreements with OpenAI, which are required by U.S. law for companies that wish to use tools like ChatGPT with private health information such as medical records. ChatGPT Edu, a newer offering from OpenAI, delivers a version of ChatGPT built for universities and the students attending them — as well as faculty, staff researchers and campus operations teams. Pricing hasn’t been made public or reported secondhand yet, but we’ll update this section if it is. ChatGPT Edu is comparable to ChatGPT Enterprise with the exception that it supports SCIM, an open protocol used to simplify cloud identity and access management. (OpenAI plans to bring SCIM to ChatGPT Enterprise in the future.) As with ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu customers get data analysis tools, admin controls, single sign-on, enhanced security and the ability to build and share custom chatbots. ChatGPT Edu also comes with the latest OpenAI models and, importantly, increased message limits.  OpenAI for Nonprofits is OpenAI’s early foray into nonprofit tech solutions. It’s not a stand-alone ChatGPT plan so much as a range of discounts for eligible organizations. Nonprofits can access ChatGPT Team at a discounted rate of $20 monthly per user. Larger nonprofits can get a 50% discount on ChatGPT Enterprise, which works out to about $30 per user.  The eligibility requirements are quite strict, however. While nonprofits based anywhere in the world can apply for discounts, OpenAI isn’t currently accepting applications from academic, medical, religious or governmental institutions.

38,Christine Hall,"Here’s everything Apple announced at the WWDC 2024 keynote, including Apple Intelligence, Siri makeover",https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2024/,"The TechCrunch team runs down all of the biggest news from the Apple WWDC 2024 keynote in an easy-to-skim digest.
© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-13T19:00:00Z,"Comment It’s WWDC 2024 keynote time! Each year Apple kicks off its Worldwide Developers Conference with a few hours of just straight announcements, like the long-awaited Apple Intelligence and a makeover for smart AI assistant, Siri. We expected much of them to revolve around the company’s artificial intelligence ambitions (and here), and Apple didn’t disappoint. We also bring you news about Vision Pro and lots of feature refreshes.  Here’s how to watch the archive of WWDC 2024. Developers should expect hardware and software updates, per the usual, and some other items we initially thought would be unveiled. Brian Heater also went on Equity to dish. Now sit back and relax while the team runs down all of the biggest news in an easy-to-skim digest. Apple is making it easier for people to discover the content inside their apps using natural language — or “semantic” — queries. Already, Spotlight has been able to search for content in developers’ apps, but it would only return results when search terms matched exactly. With this year’s addition of semantic search capabilities, people will be able to search for content in apps using search terms that are just similar in meaning. Read more Now that people are using developer betas and exploring the sessions at the event, more features that were not announced onstage are surfacing. Remember that only certain devices will be compatible with iOS 18 when it’s released later in the fall. Read more Instead, Apple is adding a new two-step permissions pop-up screen that will first ask users to allow or deny access to their contacts, as before, and then, if the user allows access, will allow them to choose which contacts they want to share, if not all. Read more Brian Heater writes about consistently requesting this certain feature from Apple: the ability to pause your activity rings. If you’re down due to a cold, on an international flight, or find that you’re vigorously shaking your wrist at 9 p.m. just to finish closing your rings, you can now pause progress via the Watch or through the connected iPhone app. Read more Apple has been on a spree of late, announcing a host of new features for its various devices earlier this week. But a lot of those features were already available to some extent on Apple devices through third-party apps. So, just like the past few years, we will examine the ideas that Apple “Sherlocked” in this year’s updates. Read more The company has since revealed some of what makes its approach to generative AI different. First and foremost is scope. Many of the most prominent companies in the space take a “bigger is better” approach to their models. Read more Instead of trying to overwhelm users with too many AI features to count, the Cupertino tech giant is carefully rolling out AI where it believes it could be useful. That means the tech won’t be included where it could be much of a threat to the carefully crafted consumer experience of using an Apple device. Read more Apple delivered two of the biggest features iMessage and its Messages app that consumers were wanting for a long time: the ability to schedule messages to send at a later date and time and support for RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. Is it the end of the green bubbles? Read more Apple is giving developers more tools to increase their app revenues and promote their apps with win-back offers and the release of a new commerce API. Read more Among the highlights of the new operating system version are a set of customization options, such as being able to arrange apps and widgets on the Home Screen and customize buttons. Other features include new text effects, the ability to lock and hide apps, new ways to manage your Mail inbox, the introduction of iMessages over satellite, a significant redesign of the Photos app and more. Now let’s see if your device is compatible. Read more There was a lot, wasn’t there? Apple’s AI push was at the heart of WWDC 2024, and our AI expert Kyle Wiggers took some time to process all of the announcements before bringing together a guide to all of the news across Siri, Genmoji, ChatGPT integrations, photo editing and beyond. Read more In a post-keynote event, Apple SVP Craig Federighi confirmed that the company would work with other third-party models beyond OpenAI, with Google’s Gemini model being highlighted as the first example. He clarified that Apple had “nothing to announce right now, but that’s our general direction.” Read more  Tesla, SpaceX and xAI exec Elon Musk took to X to continue his campaign against rival OpenAI, threatening to ban Apple devices from his businesses “if Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level,” among other responses and reactions to the conversations around WWDC on X. Read more Before you get too excited about putting Apple Intelligence to the test, check if your devices are new enough. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, along with iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips, will be able to run the new features coming alongside Apple’s AI push. Read more Apple is bringing ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other Apple apps, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other generative AI models. Read more One of the Apple Intelligence-powered features coming in iOS 18 will allow iPhone users to create AI images of people they’re messaging with — a feature that works something like an AI-upgraded Bitmoji. The goal, of course, is to make your “everyday conversations more enjoyable.”  Apple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you’re talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly. Read more For those of you who use Apple TV+, there is a new feature called InSight. The feature will allow viewers to learn actor names and song titles as they appear on the screen. Lauren Forristal writes that it’s similar to Amazon’s X-Ray technology, where Fire TV users get an overview of actor bios and behind-the-scenes information while watching TV shows and movies.  What stands out about InSight, however, is its Shazam-like functionality, which highlights the song playing in the TV show or movie and gives users the option to add it to an Apple Music playlist to listen to later. Read more Apple also made some enhancements to its smart assistant, Siri. These include adding some generative AI features that make Siri seem more natural and more personal. There’s also a new glowing light. And, Siri can also handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. Plus, for those who would rather type, you can do that now. Read more The new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences. “Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted at WWDC Monday. “And of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.” Read more That covers the consumer side of things, but WWDC is a conference for developers, and Apple revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software. A number of AI features will be added to existing SDKs, allowing for generative AI image generation, or new prompts to Siri, to allow devs to expand the Apple Intelligence footprint. Read more While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn’t easy to figure out. Now, the company introduced a Passwords app. Some of the features include a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren’t related to a website or service. Read more A new “Smart Script” feature will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil to write in Notes. Apple says it’s making handwriting your notes even smoother and straighter. The feature improves the appearance of your writing as you write by using on-device machine learning to recreate your handwriting from your notes. You’ll see your own handwriting, just smoother and more legible. Read more Who would have thought a calculator would liven up a developer’s conference? Well, Apple’s new Calculator for iPad app got everyone excited. iOS’ perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn’t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes. The additional feature does the math for you. Read more The latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia. One of the biggest features of this new OS is iPhone mirroring. Now, through macOS’ Continuity feature, you can mirror your iPhone’s screen and control it right from your Mac. Notifications on Mac pop you into iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well, but the paired iPhone stays locked while in mirror mode. Read more OK, let’s do a little deeper dive into iPhone mirroring. While Apple didn’t detail many use cases for the feature, Sarah Perez writes that it seems it would make it easier to demo apps over video calls or in person, as users could move between a slideshow presentation and a live demo of the iPhone app by launching it as if it’s another app on your Mac. Read more This new feature works much like Apple’s emergency SOS feature. When you have no signal, you’ll be given the option to find a satellite to relay the data. You’ll have to keep the phone pointed in the right direction while you do it, however, there’s an overlay above your messages to remind you. Read more Apple showed off the new Photos app as it will appear in the upcoming release of the iOS software. The new app introduces new navigation, new organizational features and other ways to discover your favorite photos, including those of friends, family, pets, trips and more. Some things to know: The new design will lead to less time searching for photos as it puts everything you need within easy reach. One major change involves how the app has been unified into a single view with the photo grid at the top and the library, organized by theme, below. Read more One of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones. As Brian Heater writes, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay’s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device’s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info — a nice added privacy element. Read more Users will now be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When you lock an app, if someone tries to tap your phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. While you have the app lock feature enabled, information from inside the app won’t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Read more Apple also shared some initial details for the upcoming major release of iOS, which is its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. As expected, much of this involves artificial intelligence. Remember when icons were locked to the grid? Well, they can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don’t hide your background photos. “iOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,” Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. Read more Speaking of icons, most of these updates are those long-requested functionalities, like the ability to set app icons and widgets wherever you want on the Home Screen, plus support for dark mode icons with different color schemes. Read more visionOS 2 brings with it productivity enhancements and “new immersive experiences.” One lets you “spatialize” photos from regular photos, leveraging AI tech. Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to bring up the control center with notifications, shortcuts and more. Read more One of the bigger announcements with this includes the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. Read more For those of you outside of the U.S., the Vision Pro headset will be available in eight new countries. Read more Apple has fallen behind its peers in the AI race, and it probably feels like it needs to pull out all the stops to impress fans and shareholders. But that shouldn’t mean overpromising on features. Read more For smart assistants: While rumors point to the company transitioning a number of employees to generative AI operations following its electric car implosion, all signs point to Apple having ceded a significant head start to the competition. As such, its most logical play is a partnership with a reigning powerhouse like OpenAI. Read more Maybe not for iPhone 15: Some other rumors say that when this generative AI comes into play, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro. That means the standard iPhone 15 may be left out in the cold on this one. Read more Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

It will also begin testing generative AI ads, the company said. The launch of Creative Lab shows that Spotify is ramping up its efforts to attract advertisers to the platform. This could likely be an attractive offering for marketers, as they’ll be able to reach Spotify’s 615 million listeners.  Additionally, Spotify is working on a new AI tool for advertisers: “Quick Audio,” which enables brands to create scripts and voiceovers using generative AI. A company spokesperson told us the tool will soon launch in Spotify Ads Managers.  A Spotify exec had earlier said the company was looking to use AI to generate host-read ads for podcasters.  Brands will be able to work with the new Creative Lab team to produce things like video and audio ads, in-app digital experiences and other interactive ad formats like call-to-action (CTA) cards, the spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Every campaign Creative Lab touches is highly customized to each specific brand and business need,” the spokesperson said. Spotify used client Rockstar Energy Drink as an example, which launched a “Press Play” livestreamed concert series within the music streaming app, featuring artists like British rapper Stormzy. Another beverage company, Aperol, will also be a Creative Lab client.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

One of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones. As the name also suggests, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay’s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device’s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info — a nice added privacy element. Apple isn’t the first to bring this feature to market, but one wonders what effects this feature will ultimately have on standalone payment device/platforms like Square. The company also announced the ability to customize icons, as well as a new password manager app. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

© 2024 TechCrunch. All rights reserved. For personal use only.",2024-06-10T18:04:27Z,"Comment One way to know for sure that you’re at a developer conference: The crowd gets really excited when you announce a new Calculator app. The addition of the app got (by far) the biggest applause pop at WWDC 2024 so far. Granted, the company has an hour or so left to announce all of its intelligence features. iOS’ perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn’t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes: The additional feature does the math for you. The feature that makes iPad an even more interesting option is the academic segment, though plenty of teachers will no doubt balk at an app that does all of the work for users. And we thought we had it good with graphing calculators back in the day. Draw a formula with the Apple Pencil, and the on-board AI will do the difficult job of actually solving the problem. Apple briefly noted during today’s event that the feature is also coming to macOS Sequoia. Both it and iPadOS 15 should be arriving later this year. Apple also announced visionOS 2 for the Vision Pro as well as updates to the Photos app. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

The company, also TechCrunch’s parent, recently launched AI-powered features for Yahoo Mail, including its own take on Gmail’s Priority Inbox and AI summaries of emails, and today it’s rolling out an AI-powered version of its Yahoo News app, leveraging technology it acquired from its latest acquisition, Artifact. Still, Yahoo has more AI plans in the works, including for its Yahoo News property on the web. Code references on the newly redesigned Yahoo News website indicated that Yahoo is testing an AI summaries feature, presumably as a way to allow visitors to quickly catch up on the news without having to read articles in their entirety.  However, while the Yahoo News app is taking learnings from Artifact when it comes to offering AI features, the AI summaries feature found on Yahoo News is not related to its acquisition of the well-liked AI news app that had been created by Instagram’s founders, but had shut down after failing to reach a wider audience. Reached for comment, Yahoo confirmed that its AI summaries on the web have been available in testing for a few months, but those tests are occurring on a small, single-digit percentage of article pages on the Yahoo News web experience, the company told TechCrunch. That would explain why most visitors to the Yahoo News website would not have likely encountered these AI summaries as of yet. The code doesn’t reveal much about the underlying technology Yahoo is using for the AI summaries, only how they would appear to site visitors — in a lightbox, a type of web component used for displaying content. Yahoo declined to share more about the technology itself or when it would launch publicly. The company does have a partnership with OpenAI for its Yahoo News mobile app, though. Combined with the Artifact-inspired revamp of Yahoo News and the AI features that arrived on Yahoo Mail, it’s clear that Yahoo is betting on AI to give its older web products and services a push. Whether simply adding AI will attract a new audience, of course, remains to be seen.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Existing investors Sequoia, which led Anterior’s $3.2 million seed round last September, and Neo, an accelerator that helped the company launch in the summer of 2022, also participated in the Series A financing. The round also included a host of angel investors, including Mustafa Suleyman, a DeepMind and Inflection AI co-founder who was hired by Microsoft in March to lead the tech giant’s consumer AI division. NEA and Anterior didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Anterior, formerly known as Co:Helm, was co-founded by Abdel Mahmoud, a former doctor who left medicine to pursue a master’s degree in computer science and a career in tech after he grew frustrated with the amount of time he spent on administrative functions rather than with patients.    The company has built an LLM-powered co-pilot that helps nurses and doctors save hours on gathering medical documentation required by insurance. Anterior’s solution aims to reduce denial rates and accelerate patient access to care. While Anterior’s initial offering is in prior authorization automation, the company eventually plans to expand into other medical administrative functions. Mohamad Makhzoumi, managing general partner on NEA’s healthcare team and co-CEO of the firm, joined Anterior’s board. Makhzoumi’s investments include Tempus, a genomic testing and data analysis company founded by Groupon founder Eric Lefkofsky, which is planning to IPO next week at a valuation of up to $6.1 billion. Makhzoumi also backed Xaira, an AI drug discovery startup that launched this year with $1 billion in funding. Anterior competes with Cohere Health, another provider of prior authorization automation, which raised a $50 million round in February led by Deerfield Management, with participation from Define Ventures, Flare Capital Partners, Longitude Capital and Polaris Partners, bringing the five-year-old company’s total funding to $106 million.   Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

44,Manish Singh,HSBC believes that $22 billion Byju’s is now worth zero | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/06/hsbc-believes-indian-edtech-byjus-currently-worth-zero/,"In a research note, HSBC estimates that the Indian edtech giant Byju's, once valued at $22 billion, is now worth nothing. HSBC estimates that the Indian edtech giant Byju's, once valued at $22 billion, is now worth nothing.",2024-06-07T02:00:49Z,"Comment BlackRock, an investor in Byju’s, estimates that its stake of Indian edtech giant, once valued at $22 billion, is now worth nothing. The write-down in its estimations, disclosed in an SEC filing, makes Byju’s one of the most spectacular startup slides in recent memory. BlackRock’s disclosure for the period ending March this year follows a rough year for the Bengaluru-based startup, which was India’s most valuable startup not long ago. Byju’s struggled to meet its financial reporting deadlines last year, ultimately falling short of its revenue projections by more than 50% as it faced various governance issues. Those issues — coupled with the abrupt resignations of its auditor and board members — contributed to derailing a $1 billion fundraise deliberation. Prosus, one of Byju’s largest investors, publicly slammed the startup, alleging the company had “regularly disregarded advice” from it. Amid the funding crunch, the startup then raised $200 million at a post-money valuation of about $250 million this year — but the investment is being legally disputed by some of its largest investors. So it doesn’t come as a surprise that BlackRock has implied a zero valuation to Byju’s. It’s not the first time the asset manager has marked down the valuation of Byju’s. At the end of October last year, BlackRock had cut the valuation of Byju’s to about $1 billion. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment. Byju’s also declined to comment.  Separately, in a research note, HSBC also estimated the value of Prosus’ 10% stake in the Indian startup to have diminished so severely that its analysts have not bothered to attribute any value to it at all. A spokesperson clarified in an email to TechCrunch after publication that HSBC was not attempting to value the whole company, just Prosus’ stake, and that refraining from assigning a value is not equivalent to assigning a value of zero. However, the research’s note chart did use zero in the column for estimated value. The bank also estimated that Prosus’ stake in a number of other startups — Meesho, PharmEasy, ElasticRun, and Stack Overflow — are not nearly as valuable as they once were. “We apply a 50% discount to the latest funding round/acquisition price for assets where the last round is older than six months to account for the recent correction in similar edtech/SaaS companies’ public sector multiples,” HSBC wrote in the note, accessed via S&P Global Intelligence. Correction: The story was updated to clarify HSBC’s valuation of Byju. The story has also been updated to emphasize BlackRock’s valuation adjustment in its Byju’s stake.

45,Lorenzo Franceschi-bicchierai,UK and Canada privacy watchdogs investigating 23andMe data breach | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/uk-and-canada-privacy-watchdogs-investigating-23andme-data-breach/,The data protection authorities are investigating the genetic testing company after hackers stole the personal data of 6.9 million customers.,2024-06-10T15:44:00Z,"Comment Privacy watchdogs in the U.K. and Canada have launched a joint investigation into the data breach at 23andMe last year.  On Monday, the U.K,’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) announced their investigation into the genetic testing company, saying the organizations will leverage “the combined resources and expertise of their two offices.”  Last year, 23andMe disclosed a security incident that affected the genetic and ancestry data of 6.9 million users, or roughly half of its overall user base. In its data breach notices, the company said it didn’t detect the hackers’ activities for around five months, from April until September 2023. 23andMe said it only became aware of the account breaches in October 2023, when hackers advertised the stolen data on the unofficial 23andMe subreddit and a well-known hacking forum.  The stolen data included the person’s name, birth year, relationship labels, the percentage of DNA shared with relatives, ancestry reports, and self-reported location. Hackers broke into around 14,000 accounts of 23andMe customers by reusing their passwords from previous breaches, a technique known as password spraying. From those 14,000 accounts, the hackers were able to scrape information on millions of other people because of an opt-in feature called the DNA Relatives, which allowed users to automatically share some of their data with other people who also had opted-in, with the goal of uncovering far-away relatives. That’s how the hackers were able to scrape information on 6.9 million users by only hacking 14,000 accounts.  In a statement, ICO Commissioner John Edwards was quoted as saying that people “need to trust that any organisation handling their most sensitive personal information has the appropriate security and safeguards in place.”  “This data breach had an international impact, and we look forward to collaborating with our Canadian counterparts to ensure the personal information of people in the U.K. is protected,” said Edwards.  The joint U.K.-Canada investigation will look into the scope of information exposed and the potential harm to the victims; whether 23andMe “had adequate safeguards” to protect users’ sensitive data; and whether 23andMe “provided adequate notification” to the ICO and the OPC.  23andMe spokesperson Andy Kill said in a statement that “23andMe acknowledges the joint investigation announced by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the UK Information Commissioner today. We intend to cooperate with these regulators’ reasonable requests relating to the credential stuffing attack discovered in October 2023.” UPDATE, June 10, 12:53 p.m. ET: This story was updated to include 23andMe’s comment.

46,Kyle Wiggers,This Week in AI: Apple won't say how the sausage gets made | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/this-week-in-ai-apple-wont-say-how-the-sausage-gets-made/,"In this edition of TechCrunch's This Week in AI newsletter, we take a look at Apple's new generative AI products -- and one unsavory aspect of them.",2024-06-12T17:08:23Z,"Comment Hiya, folks, and welcome to TechCrunch’s regular AI newsletter. This week in AI, Apple stole the spotlight. At the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in Cupertino, Apple unveiled Apple Intelligence, its long-awaited, ecosystem-wide push into generative AI. Apple Intelligence powers a whole host of features, from an upgraded Siri to AI-generated emoji to photo-editing tools that remove unwanted people and objects from photos. The company promised Apple Intelligence is being built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.  “It has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,” CEO Tim Cook noted during the keynote on Monday. “All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It’s personal intelligence, and it’s the next big step for Apple.” Apple Intelligence is classically Apple: It conceals the nitty-gritty tech behind obviously, intuitively useful features. (Not once did Cook utter the phrase “large language model.”) But as someone who writes about the underbelly of AI for a living, I wish Apple were more transparent — just this once — about how the sausage was made. Take, for example, Apple’s model training practices. Apple revealed in a blog post that it trains the AI models that power Apple Intelligence on a combination of licensed datasets and the public web. Publishers have the option of opting out of future training. But what if you’re an artist curious about whether your work was swept up in Apple’s initial training? Tough luck — mum’s the word. The secrecy could be for competitive reasons. But I suspect it’s also to shield Apple from legal challenges — specifically challenges pertaining to copyright. The courts have yet to decide whether vendors like Apple have a right to train on public data without compensating or crediting the creators of that data — in other words, whether fair use doctrine applies to generative AI. It’s a bit disappointing to see Apple, which often paints itself as a champion of commonsensical tech policy, implicitly embrace the fair use argument. Shrouded behind the veil of marketing, Apple can claim to be taking a responsible and measured approach to AI while it may very well have trained on creators’ works without permission.   A little explanation would go a long way. It’s a shame we haven’t gotten one — and I’m not hopeful we will anytime soon, barring a lawsuit (or two). Apple’s top AI features: Yours truly rounded up the top AI features Apple announced during the WWDC keynote this week, from the upgraded Siri to deep integrations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  OpenAI hires execs: OpenAI this week hired Sarah Friar, the former CEO of hyperlocal social network Nextdoor, to serve as its chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, who previously led product development at Instagram and Twitter, as its chief product officer. Mail, now with more AI: This week, Yahoo (TechCrunch’s parent company) updated Yahoo Mail with new AI capabilities, including AI-generated summaries of emails. Google introduced a similar generative summarization feature recently — but it’s behind a paywall. Controversial views: A recent study from Carnegie Mellon finds that not all generative AI models are created equal — particularly when it comes to how they treat polarizing subject matter. Sound generator: Stability AI, the startup behind the AI-powered art generator Stable Diffusion, has released an open AI model for generating sounds and songs that it claims was trained exclusively on royalty-free recordings. Google thinks it can build a generative AI model for personal health — or at least take preliminary steps in that direction. In a new paper featured on the official Google AI blog, researchers at Google pull back the curtain on Personal Health Large Language Model, or PH-LLM for short — a fine-tuned version of one of Google’s Gemini models. PH-LLM is designed to give recommendations to improve sleep and fitness, in part by reading heart and breathing rate data from wearables like smartwatches. To test PH-LLM’s ability to give useful health suggestions, the researchers created close to 900 case studies of sleep and fitness involving U.S.-based subjects. They found that PH-LLM gave sleep recommendations that were close to — but not quite as good as — recommendations given by human sleep experts.   The researchers say that PH-LLM could help to contextualize physiological data for “personal health applications.” Google Fit comes to mind; I wouldn’t be surprised to see PH-LLM eventually power some new feature in a fitness-focused Google app, Fit or otherwise. Apple devoted quite a bit of blog copy detailing its new on-device and cloud-bound generative AI models that make up its Apple Intelligence suite. Yet despite how long this post is, it reveals precious little about the models’ capabilities. Here’s our best attempt at parsing it: The nameless on-device model Apple highlights is small in size, no doubt so it can run offline on Apple devices like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. It contains 3 billion parameters — “parameters” being the parts of the model that essentially define its skill on a problem, like generating text — making it comparable to Google’s on-device Gemini model Gemini Nano, which comes in 1.8-billion-parameter and 3.25-billion-parameter sizes. The server model, meanwhile, is larger (how much larger, Apple won’t say precisely). What we do know is that it’s more capable than the on-device model. While the on-device model performs on par with models like Microsoft’s Phi-3-mini, Mistral’s Mistral 7B and Google’s Gemma 7B on the benchmarks Apple lists, the server model “compares favorably” to OpenAI’s older flagship model GPT-3.5 Turbo, Apple claims. Apple also says that both the on-device model and server model are less likely to go off the rails (i.e., spout toxicity) than models of similar sizes. That may be so — but this writer is reserving judgment until we get a chance to put Apple Intelligence to the test. This week marked the sixth anniversary of the release of GPT-1, the progenitor of GPT-4o, OpenAI’s latest flagship generative AI model. And while deep learning might be hitting a wall, it’s incredible how far the field’s come. Consider that it took a month to train GPT-1 on a dataset of 4.5 gigabytes of text (the BookCorpus, containing ~7,000 unpublished fiction books). GPT-3, which is nearly 1,500x the size of GPT-1 by parameter count and significantly more sophisticated in the prose that it can generate and analyze, took 34 days to train. How’s that for scaling? What made GPT-1 groundbreaking was its approach to training. Previous techniques relied on vast amounts of manually labeled data, limiting their usefulness. (Manually labeling data is time-consuming — and laborious.) But GPT-1 didn’t; it trained primarily on unlabeled data to “learn” how to perform a range of tasks (e.g., writing essays). Many experts believe that we won’t see a paradigm shift as meaningful as GPT-1’s anytime soon. But then again, the world didn’t see GPT-1’s coming, either.

Seven of",2024-06-07T22:20:19Z,"Comment It turns out the space industry has a lot of ideas on how to improve NASA’s $11 billion, 15-year plan to collect and return samples from Mars. Seven of these proposals have caught the agency’s attention.  Announced today, NASA has awarded $1.5 million contracts to seven companies to further develop their plans for the revamped Mars Sample Return mission. The awardees, and the title of their proposals, are as follows:  A total of 10 studies — including two NASA centers and the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Applied Physics Laboratory — were selected to produce studies. These were selected after the agency put out a request for proposals in April.  The titles don’t really say very much at all about the respective proposals — for example, it’s no surprise that SpaceX is offering up Starship for a mission to Mars, but how exactly the vehicle will be enabled to collect and return samples is still unclear. That’s the whole point of the study period: to help NASA understand whether there are viable alternative mission designs or mission elements to bring Martian samples home safely.  According to the request for proposal, studies could be for complete overhauls of the mission design, or for designs that include elements of NASA’s MSR mission or NASA’s Artemis program.  NASA turned to private industry after finally admitting that its architecture for MSR is incredibly complicated. In fact, it’s a bit of a misnomer to even call it a single mission, given that the plan involved the Perseverance rover, a novel sample retrieval lander, a rocket called a Mars Ascent Vehicle, and an Earth return orbiter. These vehicles would need to work in perfect synchronicity to collect and transport the samples.  Last year, an independent review board recommended that NASA revisit the mission design given the concerns about the technical features and the high costs. So the agency is doing just that: In documents related to the RFP, NASA said it’s looking for a less complex mission design and one that would reduce the total costs to the agency. The agency also said it was looking for the earliest possible return date.  Companies will start work in July and complete their studies in October.   Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

48,Zack Whittaker,What Snowflake isn't saying about its customer data breaches | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/07/snowflake-ticketmaster-lendingtree-customer-data-breach/,"As another Snowflake customer confirms a data breach, the cloud data company says its position ""remains unchanged.""",2024-06-08T10:56:23Z,"Featured Article Comment Snowflake’s security problems following a recent spate of customer data thefts are, for want of a better word, snowballing. Ticketmaster was the first company to link its recent data breach to the cloud data company Snowflake, and loan comparison site LendingTree has now confirmed its QuoteWizard subsidiary had data stolen from Snowflake. “We can confirm that we use Snowflake for our business operations, and that we were notified by them that our subsidiary, QuoteWizard, may have had data impacted by this incident,” Megan Greuling, a spokesperson for LendingTree, told TechCrunch. “We take these matters seriously, and immediately after hearing from [Snowflake] launched an internal investigation,” Greuling said. “As of this time, it does not appear that consumer financial account information was impacted, nor information of the parent entity, LendingTree.” Greuling declined to comment further, citing the company’s ongoing investigation. As more affected customers come forward, Snowflake has said little beyond a brief statement on its website reiterating that there wasn’t a data breach of its own systems. Instead, it says customers were not using multifactor authentication, or MFA — a security measure that Snowflake doesn’t enforce or require its customers to enable by default. Snowflake was itself caught out by the incident, saying a former employee’s “demo” account was compromised because it was only protected with a username and password. In a statement Friday, Snowflake said its position “remains unchanged.” It cited an earlier statement in which Snowflake’s chief information security officer, Brad Jones, said this was a “targeted campaign directed at users with single-factor authentication” and using credentials stolen from info-stealing malware or obtained from previous data breaches. The lack of MFA appears to be how cybercriminals downloaded huge amounts of data from Snowflake customers’ environments, which weren’t protected by the additional security layer. TechCrunch earlier this week found online hundreds of Snowflake customer credentials stolen by password-stealing malware that infected the computers of employees who have access to their employer’s Snowflake environment. The number of credentials suggests there remains a risk to Snowflake customers who have yet to change their passwords or enable MFA. Throughout the week, TechCrunch has sent more than a dozen questions to Snowflake about the ongoing incident affecting its customers as we continue to report on the story. Snowflake declined to answer our questions on at least six occasions.  These are some of the questions we’re asking, and why. Snowflake said it has currently notified a “limited number of Snowflake customers” who the company believes may have been affected. On its website, Snowflake says it has more than 9,800 customers, including tech companies, telcos, and healthcare providers. Snowflake spokesperson Danica Stanczak declined to say if the number of affected customers was in the tens, dozens, hundreds, or more. It’s likely that, despite the handful of reported customer breaches this week, we are only in the early days of understanding the scale of this incident. It may not be clear even to Snowflake how many of its customers are yet affected, since the company will either have to rely on its own data, such as logs, or find out directly from an affected customer. It’s not known how soon Snowflake could have known about the intrusions into its customers’ accounts. Snowflake’s statement said it became aware on May 23 of the “threat activity” — the accessing of customer accounts and downloading their contents — but subsequently found evidence of intrusions dating back to a no-more-specific timeframe than mid-April, suggesting the company does have some data to rely on.  But that also leaves open the question why Snowflake did not detect at the time the exfiltration of large amounts of customers’ data from its servers until much later in May, or if it did, why Snowflake didn’t publicly alert its customers sooner. Incident response firm Mandiant, which Snowflake called in to help with outreach to its customers, told Bleeping Computer at the end of May that the firm had already been helping affected organizations for “several weeks.” A key line from Snowflake’s statement says: “We did find evidence that a threat actor obtained personal credentials to and accessed demo accounts belonging to a former Snowflake employee. It did not contain sensitive data.” Some of the stolen customer credentials linked to info-stealing malware include those belonging to a then-Snowflake employee, according to a review by TechCrunch. As we previously noted, TechCrunch is not naming the employee, as it’s not clear they did anything wrong. The fact that Snowflake was caught out by its own lack of MFA enforcement allowing cybercriminals to download data from a then-employee’s “demo” account using only their username and password highlights a fundamental problem in Snowflake’s security model.  But it remains unclear what role, if any, that this demo account has on the customer data thefts because it’s not yet known what data was stored within, or if it contained data from Snowflake’s other customers. Snowflake declined to say what role, if any, the then-Snowflake employee’s demo account has on the recent customer breaches. Snowflake reiterated that the demo account “did not contain sensitive data,” but repeatedly declined to say how the company defines what it considers “sensitive data.”  We asked if Snowflake believes that individuals’ personally identifiable information is sensitive data. Snowflake declined to comment.  It’s not unusual for companies to force-reset their customers’ passwords following a data breach. But if you ask Snowflake, there has been no breach. And while that may be true in the sense that there has been no apparent compromise of its central infrastructure, Snowflake’s customers are very much getting breached. Snowflake’s advice to its customers is to reset and rotate Snowflake credentials and enforce MFA on all accounts. Snowflake previously told TechCrunch that its customers are on the hook for their own security: “Under Snowflake’s shared responsibility model, customers are responsible for enforcing MFA with their users.” But since these Snowflake customer data thefts are linked to the use of stolen usernames and passwords of accounts that aren’t protected with MFA, it’s unusual that Snowflake has not intervened on behalf of its customers to protect their accounts with password resets or enforced MFA. It’s not unprecedented. Last year, cybercriminals scraped 6.9 million user and genetic records from 23andMe accounts that weren’t protected with MFA. 23andMe reset user passwords out of caution to prevent further scraping attacks, and subsequently required the use of MFA on all of its users’ accounts.  We asked Snowflake if the company planned to reset the passwords of its customers’ accounts to prevent any possible further intrusions. Snowflake declined to comment. Snowflake appears to be moving toward rolling out MFA by default, according to tech news site Runtime, quoting Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy in an interview this week. This was later confirmed by Snowflake’s CISO Jones in the Friday update. “We are also developing a plan to require our customers to implement advanced security controls, like multifactor authentication (MFA) or network policies, especially for privileged Snowflake customer accounts,” said Jones.  A timeframe for the plan was not given.

49,Aisha Malik,FTC Chair Lina Khan says the agency is going after the 'mob bosses' in Big Tech | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/11/ftc-chair-lina-khan-says-the-agency-is-going-after-the-mob-bosses-in-big-tech/,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is focusing its efforts on going after the big guys in Big Tech, according to FTC Chair Lina Khan.",2024-06-12T00:06:24Z,"Comment The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is focusing its efforts on going after Big Tech, according to FTC Chair Lina Khan, who spoke at TechCrunch’s Strictly VC event in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.  Khan said the agency is focused on going after the players that are doing the biggest harm, as opposed to just increasing the number of cases that it brings forward. “One thing that’s been important for me is to make sure that we’re actually looking at where we see the biggest harm,” Khan said. “Where do we see players that are systematically driving these illegal behaviors? Being able to go after the ‘mob boss’ is going to be more effective than going after the henchman at the bottom.” The comments come a few days after The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC is opening up an antitrust probe of Microsoft over its partnership with Inflection AI. The FTC and the Department of Justice have struck a deal to investigate Microsoft, Open AI and Nvidia over potential antitrust violations, according to The New York Times. The FTC has also gone after Meta, Amazon, Google, Apple and others over the past years.  Khan says the FTC wants to be effective in its enforcement strategy, which is why it has been taking on lawsuits that “go up against some of the big guys.” If the FTC is successful, it can have a beneficial impact on the marketplace, she said.  During today’s @StrictlyVC event, @FTC Chair @linakhanFTC says the agency's enforcement strategy prioritizes going after “the mob boss” pic.twitter.com/fIxAiIPj1a The types of cases that the FTC selects can act as a deterrent, she said, noting that the FTC is already seeing that happen.  “Five or six or seven years ago, when you were thinking about a potential deal, antitrust risk, or even the antitrust analysis, was nowhere near the top of the conversation. And now, it is up front and center. And so, for an enforcer, if you’re having companies think about that legal issue on the front end, that’s a really good thing, because we’re not having to spend as many public resources taking on deals.” Speaking to an audience of startup founders and VCs who see exits as a big path, Khan noted that what the law really prohibits is an exit or acquisition that’s going to fortify a monopoly or allow a dominant firm to form a competitive threat.  Khan said that in any given year, the FTC sees up to 3,000 merger filings reported to the agency and that around 2% of those deals get a second look by the government.  “So you have 98% of deals that, for the most part, are going through,” she said. “If you are a startup or a founder that is eager for an acquisition as an exit, a world in which you have five or six or seven or eight potential suitors, I would think, is a better world in which you just have one or two, right? And so, actually promoting more competition at that level to ensure that startups have you know more of a fair chance of getting a better valuation, I think would be beneficial as well.” Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

50,Christine Hall,Insight Partners backs Canary Technologies’ mission to elevate hotel guest experiences | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/insight-partners-hotel-technology-canary-technologies/,The hotel guest management technology company’s platform digitizes the hotel guest journey from post-booking through checkout.,2024-06-12T13:42:48Z,"Comment The hospitality industry is back, baby. And with it comes a chance for technology startups to not only help hotels streamline their operations, but also focus on how they can improve the guest experience. “The predominant traveler today was born in an age where they are very comfortable with technology,” Harman Singh Narula, Canary Technologies co-founder and CEO, said. “They have expectations. For example, they want to text message the front desk instead of picking up the phone.” And with other options available, like Airbnb, hotels are facing competition in the market — competition that is “really good at technology,” Narula said — and the hotels have to address it.  Narula started Canary Technologies with longtime friend SJ Sawhney to provide that technology so hotels can offer better guest experiences, augmented by technology. Narula formerly worked at Starwood Hotels & Resorts and was a management consultant at Bain & Company. Sawhney, who is president of the company, led product and technology at Stayful, a booking platform for independent and boutique hotels founded by the former president of Hotels.com. They were part of Y Combinator’s summer 2018 cohort, and at the time they were developing software to handle offline booking processes and get rid of paper contracts. Today, the hotel guest management technology company’s platform digitizes the hotel guest journey from post-booking through checkout with tools that manage mobile check-in/checkout, registrations, upsells, guest messaging and digital tipping. It’s a concept that has caught on. Canary now works with more than 20,000 hoteliers globally at brands like Marriott International, Four Seasons, Choice Hotels, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Rosewood and Intercontinental Hotel Group.  The company has also grown in the past couple of years as hotels deploy additional Canary tools. Since 2022, the company has grown over 100% in terms of revenue, Narula said. Venture capital investors are paying attention. In March, Mews, a hotel SaaS startup, raised $110 million on a $1.2 billion valuation to help hotels better manage their IT. There’s also Life House, which offers software for hotel operators and owners, that last raised $60 million in 2021. Now it’s Canary Technologies’ turn. The company closed on $50 million in Series C funding to support a large deployment of its guest-facing AI technology. The funding, led by Insight Partners, was preempted by inside investors, Narula said. Though he didn’t give a specific valuation, Narula did say the valuation has now more than doubled since the company’s $30 million Series B round in 2022. Insight also led that round. In addition to Insight Partners, existing investors F-Prime Capital, Thayer Ventures, Y Combinator and Commerce Ventures joined the Series C round. This new investment brings Canary’s total fundraising to date to nearly $100 million. “In a year that proved tough on growth and execution in the tech ecosystem, we saw Canary thrive and exceed their ambitious targets, prompting us to double down,” Thomas Krane, managing director at Insight Partners, said in a statement. “We continue to be impressed with Harman, SJ, and the team’s tenacity and ability to deliver hoteliers the best-in-class solutions they need most, and are honored to be a part of the company’s journey.” Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

51,Frederic Lardinois,Databricks expands Mosaic AI to help enterprises build with LLMs | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/databricks-expands-mosaic-ai-to-help-enterprises-build-with-llms/,"A year ago, Databricks acquired MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Now rebranded as Mosaic AI, the platform has become integral to Databricks' AI solutions.",2024-06-12T13:02:22Z,"Comment A year ago, Databricks acquired MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Now rebranded as Mosaic AI, the platform has become integral to Databricks’ AI solutions. Today, at the company’s Data + AI Summit, it is launching a number of new features for the service. Ahead of the announcements, I spoke to Databricks co-founders CEO Ali Ghodsi and CTO Matei Zaharia. Databricks is launching five new Mosaic AI tools at its conference: Mosaic AI Agent Framework, Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation, Mosaic AI Tools Catalog, Mosaic AI Model Training and Mosaic AI Gateway. “It’s been an awesome year — huge developments in GenAI. Everybody’s excited about it,” Ghodsi told me. “But the things everybody cares about are still the same three things: How do we make the quality or reliability of these models go up? Number two, how do we make sure that it’s cost-efficient? And there’s a huge variance in cost between models here — a gigantic, orders-of-magnitude difference in price. And third, how do we do that in a way that we keep the privacy of our data?” Today’s launches aim to cover the majority of these concerns for Databricks’ customers. Zaharia also noted that the enterprises that are now deploying large language models (LLMs) into production are using systems that have multiple components. That often means they make multiple calls to a model (or maybe multiple models, too), and use a variety of external tools for accessing databases or doing retrieval augmented generation (RAG). These compound systems speed up LLM-based applications, save money by using cheaper models for specific queries or caching results and, maybe most importantly, make the results more trustworthy and relevant by augmenting the foundation models with proprietary data. “We think that is the future of really high-impact, mission-critical AI applications,” he explained. “Because if you think about it, if you’re doing something really mission critical, you’ll want engineers to be able to control all aspects of it — and you do that with a modular system. So we’re developing a lot of basic research on what’s the best way to create these [systems] for a specific task so developers can easily work with them and hook up all the bits, trace everything through and see what’s happening.” As for actually building these systems, Databricks is launching two services this week: the Mosaic AI Agent Framework and the Mosaic AI Tools Catalog. The AI Agent Framework takes the company’s serverless vector search functionality, which became generally available last month and provides developers with the tools to build their own RAG-based applications on top of that.  Ghodsi and Zaharia emphasized that the Databricks vector search system uses a hybrid approach, combining classic keyword-based search with embedding search. All of this is integrated deeply with the Databricks data lake and the data on both platforms is always automatically kept in sync. This includes the governance features of the overall Databricks platform — and specifically the Databricks Unity Catalog governance layer — to ensure, for example, that personal information doesn’t leak into the vector search service. Talking about the Unity Catalog (which the company is now also slowly open sourcing), it’s worth noting that Databricks is now extending this system to let enterprises govern which AI tools and functions these LLMs can call upon when generating answers. This catalog, Databricks says, will also make these services more discoverable across a company.  Ghodsi also highlighted that developers can now take all of these tools to build their own agents by chaining together models and functions using Langchain or LlamaIndex, for example. And indeed, Zaharia tells me that a lot of Databricks customers are already using these tools today. “There are a lot of companies using these things, even the agent-like workflows. I think people are often surprised by how many there are, but it seems to be the direction things are going. And we’ve also found in our internal AI applications, like the assistant applications for our platform, that this is the way to build them,” he said. To evaluate these new applications Databricks is also launching the Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation, an AI-assisted evaluation tool that combines LLM-based judges to test how well the AI does in production, but also allows enterprises to quickly get feedback from users (and let them label some initial datasets, too). The Agent Evaluation includes a UI component based on Databricks’ acquisition of Lilac earlier this year, which lets users visualize and search massive text datasets. “Every customer we have is saying: I do need to do some labeling internally, I’m going to have some employees do it. I just need maybe 100 answers, or maybe 500 answers — and then we can feed that into the LLM judges,” Ghodsi explained. Another way to improve results is by using fine-tuned models. For this, Databricks now offers the Mosaic AI Model Training service, which — you guessed it — allows its users to fine-tune models with their organization’s private data to help them perform better on specific tasks. The last new tool is the Mosaic AI Gateway, which the company describes as a “unified interface to query, manage, and deploy any open source or proprietary model.” The idea here is to allow users to query any LLM in a governed way, using a centralized credentials store. No enterprise, after all, wants its engineers to send random data to third-party services.  In times of shrinking budgets, the AI Gateway also allows IT to set rate limits for different vendors to keep costs manageable. Additionally, these enterprises then also get usage tracking and tracing for debugging these systems.  As Ghodsi told me, all of these new features are a reaction to how Databricks’ users are now working with LLMs. “We saw a big shift happen in the market in the last quarter and a half. Beginning of last year, anyone you talk to, they’d say: we’re pro open source, open source is awesome. But when you really pushed people, they were using Open AI. Everybody, no matter what they said, no matter how much they were touting how open source is awesome, behind the scenes, they were using Open AI.” Now, these customers have become far more sophisticated and are using open models (very few are really open source, of course), which in turn requires them to adopt an entirely new set of tools to tackle the problems — and opportunities — that come with that.

52,Sean O'kane,Tesla and its fans waged an unprecedented battle over Elon Musk's $56B pay package | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/tesla-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote/,Tesla submitted a record number of SEC filings related to the vote and fans fired off a fusillade of posts in a bid to re-approve the deal.,2024-06-13T17:22:59Z,"Comment The Tesla fans posted. And over the last few months, Elon Musk engaged. Every time he did, Tesla’s legal team had to get to work, writing and submitting regulatory filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It’s all part of an effort to say that, this time, when the shareholders vote to approve his monster $56 billion compensation package, they were fully informed.  The Delaware judge who rescinded the 2018 pay package in January did so in part because shareholders weren’t fully informed on the stockholder vote due to inaccurate proxy statements. So in the run-up to this vote — which will be finalized at Thursday’s annual shareholder meeting — Tesla has clearly wanted to cover as many bases as possible by over-sharing anything Musk posted about or engaged with. Here they are transcribing a five-minute video from TeslaBoomerMama video that Musk shared on X, where she pleaded with shareholders to vote “yes.” Here they are filing a video Musk shared of Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos from 2018 supporting the original compensation plan, which was posted by an account the Anti-Defamation League says promotes QAnon. Here they are posting a screenshot of a post of support from Musk’s former divorce lawyer, and Tesla’s former general counsel, Todd Maron. Here they are, in the final week before the vote, piling dozens of screenshots of posts Musk interacted with into one very long filing. None of these filings are signed, so it’s not clear who has been doing all this work. Musk has a bone-deep habit of behaving in a way that creates billable hours, so some of this is to be expected. But this push to “re-ratify” his compensation package has had Tesla’s regulatory team busier than maybe ever. In terms of just raw filings, Tesla has submitted more to the SEC in the last three months than it has at any point in the last five years:  Strip out all the filings related to executives and institutional investors buying and selling shares, as well as all letters to and from the SEC, and Tesla has been submitting more filings than in any time since before the “funding secured” mess in 2018: This is all set against the backdrop of an unrelenting get-out-the-vote effort from Tesla’s biggest fans over the last few months. They’ve posted countless calls-to-action, have coordinated via direct messages on Musk’s X platform to help shareholders figure out how to vote and more. Tesla and its employees have joined in, too. The company posted photos of its Optimus robot prototype filling out a vote card. It published a rosy timeline of the company’s accomplishments since the plan was originally voted on in 2018. It even spun up an entire website dedicated to promoting the shareholder meeting, including a video from Tesla chair Robyn Denholm — who, until this recent push, rarely made public appearances on behalf of the company.  Many of its top executives voiced support, including some who have rarely used X. Tesla VP of Supply Chain Karn Budhiraj, who has only ever posted about a dozen times on X, wrote, “Elon is the driving force at Tesla and is critical for the future of the company.” Tom Zhu, who was recently moved back to China amid Tesla’s larger restructuring, wrote that the company has a “vast vision beneath the surface that requires Elon’s wisdom, courage, and decisiveness to achieve.” Grace Tao, a high-ranking employee who leads communications in China and reportedly manages Tesla’s relationship with the government there, also posted (on Weibo) about Musk’s “wisdom, courage, and determination.”  Vanishingly few of the company’s employees or its supporters actually touched on the substance of the judge’s opinion that got us here: that Musk’s undeniable sway over Tesla and its board meant the process leading up to the pay package was inherently unfair. But the effort has nonetheless helped Tesla’s shareholders reinforce the narrative around the company (and its stock) that Tesla is nothing without Musk, and that he deserves the compensation package he testified he essentially negotiated with himself. Since the fight over Musk’s pay package and the re-incorporation to Texas is likely headed for months of legal challenges, that might be victory enough for now.  In fact, they’re already celebrating as the votes are being tallied. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

53,Aria Alamalhodaei,Albedo takes Earth observation up close and personal from very low Earth orbit | TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/14/albedo-takes-earth-observation-up-close-and-personal-from-very-low-earth-orbit/,Satellite imagery startup Albedo is preparing for its up close and personal debut. Albedo’s first satellite will take to orbit next spring as the company,2024-06-14T22:19:00Z,"Comment Satellite imagery startup Albedo is preparing for its up-close-and-personal debut. Albedo’s first satellite will take to orbit next spring as the company looks to turn the commercial Earth observation industry upside down with its novel approach and ultra-high-resolution cameras.  The satellite, called Clarity, will hitch a ride to very low Earth orbit (VLEO) on SpaceX’s Transporter-13 ride-share mission. That mission is currently set to launch no earlier than February 2025, so Albedo should have its first satellite operating in orbit this time next year.  Albedo additionally announced seven customers that reserved a portion of Clarity’s image tasking, including satellite imagery broker SkyFi and German energy company Open Grid Europe.  “It’s an aggressive schedule,” Albedo CEO Topher Haddad said. “This is the first time we’re posting a satellite mockup publicly. I think a lot of people probably think we’re more of a small satellite, but it’s a pretty complex robotic system with a large aperture telescope, and a pretty powerful capability. A lot of that timeline was mostly driven by the custom technology we’ve been developing to fly a high-res system in VLEO.” The startup is developing a first-of-its-kind spacecraft capable of capturing extremely high-resolution imagery, operating in very low Earth orbit — images so sharp, the company claims, that they’ve historically been the exclusive purview of American defense and intelligence organizations.  The company says it will be able to sell 10-centimeter-per-pixel images to commercial and government customers at unprecedentedly low prices because of its unique — and quite large — satellite bus. (A 10-centimeter resolution image means that each pixel covers an area on the ground the size of 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters. The largest optical imagery providers today collect images at a 30-centimeter resolution, which is algorithmically improved to 15 centimeters.) Satellites that do collect 10-centimeter resolution tend to operate in higher orbital altitudes, like low Earth orbit, and by some estimates cost billions of dollars each to manufacture and launch. Low Earth orbit is generally defined as the orbital band at an altitude of around 2,000 kilometers, while VLEO is between 250 and 450 kilometers. Albedo’s satellites will be the size of refrigerators when all is said and done, which is much larger than many other commercial Earth observation satellites that are currently operating even farther away from Earth. It seems counterintuitive to make the satellites so heavy — one might think that to counter the increased atmospheric drag, it would be imperative to make the satellites as light as possible — but Haddad said in a recent interview that the company is able to counteract that drag using ultra-efficient electric propulsion and particular design decisions, like mounting the solar panels on the spacecraft instead of deploying them in two wings.  “You normally deploy [the solar panels] because you can generate more power that way, but we needed to minimize the cross-sectional area so that that mass and that electric propulsion work out to give us the counteracting piece of the drag,” Haddad explained. As the company moves toward putting hardware in orbit, it also brought on Kathryn Tobey as its first independent director on its now six-person board. Tobey had a 34-year career at Lockheed Martin, where she eventually became VP of the company’s $3 billion Space, Special Programs line of business. (Prior to founding Albedo, Haddad cut his teeth at Lockheed Martin working on some of these same systems.) That division did high-tech national security work, including classified projects — exactly the customer set Albedo is aiming to target on the government side.  “She brings both those superpowers, which I think is pretty rare to have, both that deep technical understanding, not just of satellites, but of our unique niche of high-performance imaging satellites, and the national security customer relationship and understanding that mission very well,” Haddad said.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.
