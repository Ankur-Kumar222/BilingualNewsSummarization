0,Jane Thier,"Both a ‘skills tsunami’ and a ‘silver tsunami’ are set to hit the workforce at the same time, McKinsey says.",https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/skills-tsunami-future-of-work-mckinsey/,Only companies ready to battle through both will succeed.,2024-06-07T10:00:00Z,"Batten down the hatches: Both a “‘skills tsunami”’ and a “‘silver tsunami”’ are on the horizon, according to a panel of McKinsey executives. Back in 2010, the U.S. had around 12 million more unemployed people than it had job vacancies, senior McKinsey partner Anu Madgavkar said during the consultancy’s media day last week. “Despite the ups and downs of Covid, things are more normal now, but we still have a deficit—2.5 million more vacancies than job seekers.” That imbalance, coupled with the ever-present advancements in AI, has led to what Madgavkar calls a “skills tsunami.” She defined the term as the massive shift in capabilities workers are soon going to need. There’s also, she added, a “silver tsunami,” which describes the institutional loss of talent and perspective as millions of older workers head into retirement.  Reacting to both those tsunamis with agility comes back to employee support and nurturing. “How do we increase internal mobility to help our existing workforce learn more skills?” Madgavkar said. “How do you come back to performance management? The companies that do that well, end up most successful.”  A key aspect to performance oversight will be continual productivity growth. On the panel, Kweilin Ellingrud, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute, defined productivity growth as simply “producing more, with either the same or less inputs.” It matters to everyone, even those at the very bottom of the corporate ladder, because over time, productivity growth drives standards of living. The good news: Median productivity growth has increased sixfold since the turn of the millennium, Ellingrud said. “Globally, productivity is a great story.” AI, of course, will play a significant role too. Per McKinsey’s newest research report on the state of AI, released Thursday, nearly two-thirds of companies are already using generative AI regularly—double the percentage that said the same 10 months ago. Three quarters of respondents said they think gen AI will lead to “significant” or “disruptive” changes in their industries going forward. To be prepared for those changes, many American businesses are currently considering a “relayering” of their workforce, which in practice often means leaving more room for nuance in organizational structure—and often redefining the middle manager role from scratch.  “Clients are asking, how do I equip the middle manager to deliver full value for his other teams?” Brooke Weddle, a senior McKinsey partner, said. “That requires, probably, fewer managers, and for those that remain, re-scoping their role.” Then there are the persistent talent shortages, both in tech and skilled trades. “Given the churn we’re experiencing, not only do we not have enough skilled trade workers, we have a mismatch resulting in what we call $5 billion worth of cost to U.S. companies,” Weddle said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

1,Amanda Gerut,Tesla board chair says not paying Elon Musk is unfair—‘Put yourself in his shoes’,https://fortune.com/2024/06/06/tesla-board-chair-says-not-paying-musk-unfair/,Investors will vote on the Tesla CEO’s $56 billion stock option package next week.,2024-06-07T00:27:15Z,"A deal’s a deal, according to Tesla board chair Robin Denholm. And the Tesla board wants investors to back its agreement with CEO Elon Musk in awarding him the largest pay package in history, once valued at $56 billion. Tesla shareholders will vote next week to ratify Musk’s stock option grant for a second time after a judge rescinded the award in January. The Delaware Chancery Court ruled that there was a lack of independence among directors and that improper negotiations took place between Musk and the board. Denholm, speaking on CNBC, said she has been in discussions with Tesla’s largest investors on a daily basis about the June 13 vote on Musk’s pay in recent weeks. However, on Thursday Denholm said she was directly addressing Tesla’s cohort of retail shareholders. The independent board chair explained that the vote boils down to “fairness to our CEO.” Shareholders have benefited tremendously, she said, with Musk’s leadership ushering in $735 billion in market value from 2018 to 2023. Employees, shareholders, and customers have all reaped rewards—everyone except Musk himself, argued Denholm. The Tesla leader took “a huge risk” with the pay package, and had he not hit the milestones in the plan approved by investors in 2018, he would have not been paid a penny. “That risk-reward is very important in Corporate America,” said Denholm on CNBC. “It’s very important from a reaching for the stars perspective if you like, or for Mars in this case.” Ambitious goals and commensurate compensation are what drives innovation, and the stock options underlying Musk’s pay package are “very well earned,” said Denholm. Not all shareholders are on board.  New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and other investors met this week to discuss the Tesla vote. The NYC retirement funds hold Tesla shares worth about $627 million and will vote against Musk’s pay plan and the reelection bids of Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch. Musk’s brother and Murdoch are too close to the Tesla CEO and so are other board members, said Lander. “A billionaire can’t just have his brother and his besties be the ones to decide what rules they’ll follow, what courts they’ll listen to, and what rules they’ll abide by,” said Lander this week. Amalgamated Bank and half a dozen other Tesla investors have also indicated in a letter that they plan to withhold support for Musk’s pay plan or the board members’ election bids.   Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to Denholm, the board deliberated over what would happen if shareholders didn’t approve Musk’s pay and directors determined that a second vote with the additional disclosures the judge asked for was the best option. She admitted that it was possible the pay plan could be subject to another legal challenge even if investors approved it, but that it would be detrimental to shareholder primacy. Plus, ratifying the prior plan rather than creating a new plan would cost investors more in the long run, said Denholm. The company already took a stock-based compensation charge of over $2 billion when the options were first granted. Today, that charge would be $25 billion. But aside from the cost, Denholm said Musk deserves to be paid for his work. “Put yourself in his shoes,” she said. “You’ve worked really hard, incredibly hard, over six years to lead the company through transformational growth” that nobody thought was possible. After all that effort to hit the goals only to have the package overturned even after a deal was struck would be incredibly difficult to overcome. “How would you feel?” said Denholm. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

2,"Bernard Condon, The Associated Press","‘Zombie’ companies soar to nearly 7,000—and many of these publicly traded firms won’t survive",https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/zombie-company-numbers-soar-debt-loans/,"As the number of zombies has grown, so too has the potential damage if they are forced to file for bankruptcy or close their doors permanently.",2024-06-07T08:38:51Z,"They are called zombies, companies so laden with debt that they are just stumbling by on the brink of survival, barely able to pay even the interest on their loans and often just a bad business hit away from dying off for good. An Associated Press analysis found their numbers have soared to nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies around the world — 2,000 in the United States alone — whiplashed by years of piling up cheap debt followed by stubborn inflation that has pushed borrowing costs to decade highs. And now many of these mostly small and mid-sized walking wounded could soon be facing their day of reckoning, with due dates looming on hundreds of billions of dollars of loans they may not be able to pay back. “They’re going to get crushed,” Valens Securities Managing Director Robert Spivey said of the weakest zombies. Added Miami investor Mark Spitznagel, who famously bet against stocks before the last two crashes: “The clock is ticking.” Zombies are commonly defined as companies that have failed to make enough money from operations in the past three years to pay even the interest on their loans. AP’s analysis found their ranks in raw numbers have jumped over the past decade by a third or more in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the U.S., including companies that run Carnival Cruise Line, JetBlue Airways, Wayfair, Peloton, Italy’s Telecom Italia and British soccer giant Manchester United. To be sure, the number of companies, in general, has increased over the past decade, making comparisons difficult, but even limiting the analysis to companies that existed a decade ago, zombies have jumped nearly 30%. They include utilities, food producers, tech companies, owners of hospitals and nursing home chains whose weak finances hobbled their responses in the pandemic, and real estate firms struggling with half-empty office buildings in the heart of major cities. As the number of zombies has grown, so too has the potential damage if they are forced to file for bankruptcy or close their doors permanently. Companies in the AP’s analysis employ at least 130 million people in a dozen countries. Already, the number of U.S. companies going bankrupt has hit a 14-year high, a surge expected in a recession, not an expansion. Corporate bankruptcies have also recently hit highs of nearly a decade or more in Canada, the U.K., France and Spain. Some experts say zombies may be able to avoid layoffs, selloffs of business units or collapse if central banks cut interest rates, which the European Central Bank began doing this week, though scattered defaults and bankruptcies could still drag on the economy. Others think the pandemic inflated the ranks of zombies and the impact is temporary. “Revenue went down, or didn’t grow as much as projected, but that doesn’t mean they are all about to go bust,” said Martin Fridson, CEO of research firm FridsonVision High Yield Strategy. For its part, Wall Street isn’t panicking. Investors have been buying stock of some zombies and their “junk bonds,” loans rating agencies deem most at risk of default. While that may help zombies raise cash in the short term, investors pouring money into these securities and pushing up their prices could eventually face heavy losses. “We have people gambling in the public markets at an unprecedented level,” said David Trainer, head of New Constructs, an investment research group that tracks the cash drain on zombies. “They don’t see risk.” Credit rating agencies and economists warned about the dangers of companies piling on debt for years as interest rates fell but got a big push when central banks around the world cut benchmark rates to near zero in the 2009 financial crisis and then again in the 2020-21 pandemic. It was a giant, unprecedented experiment designed to spark a borrowing binge that would help avert a worldwide depression. It also created what some economists saw as a credit bubble that spread far beyond zombies, with low rates that also enticed heavy borrowing by governments, consumers and bigger, healthier companies. The difference for many zombies is they lack deep cash reserves, and the interest they pay on many of their loans is variable, not fixed, so higher rates are hurting them right now. Most dangerously, zombie debt was often not used to expand, hire or invest in technology, but on buying back their own stock. These so-called repurchases allow companies to “retire” shares, or take them off the market, a way to make up for new shares often created to boost the pay and retention packages for CEOs and other top executives. But too many stock buybacks can drain cash from a business, which is what happened at Bed Bath & Beyond. The retail chain that once operated 1,500 stores struggled for years with a troubled transition to digital sales and other problems, but its heavy borrowing and decision to spend $7 billion in a decade on buybacks played a key role in its downfall. Those buybacks came amid big paydays for top management, which Bed Bath & Beyond said in regulatory filings were intended to align with financial performance. Pay for just three top executives topped $140 million, according to executive data firm Equilar, even as its stock sunk from $80 to zero. Tens of thousands of workers in all 50 states lost their jobs as the chain spiraled to its bankruptcy filing last year. Companies had a chance to cut their debt after then-President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul slashed corporate rates and allowed repatriation of profits overseas. But most of the windfall was spent on buybacks instead. Over the next two years, U.S. companies spent a record $1.3 trillion repurchasing and retiring their own stock, a 50% jump from the prior two years. SmileDirectClub went from spending a little over $1 million a year on buying its own stock before the tax cut to spending $780 million as it boosted pay packages of top executives. One former CEO got $20 million in just four years. Stock in the heavily indebted teeth-straightening company plunged before it went out of business last year and put 2,700 people out of work. “I was like, ‘How did this ever happen?’” said George Pettigrew, who held a tech job at the company’s Nashville, Tennessee, headquarters. ”I was shocked at the amount of the debt.” Another zombie, JetBlue, suffered problems felt by many airlines, including the lingering impact of lost business during the pandemic. But it also was hurt by the decision to double its debt in the past decade and purchase hundreds of millions of dollars of its own stock. As interest costs soared and profits evaporated, that stock has dropped by two-thirds, and JetBlue has not made enough in pre-tax earnings to pay $717 million in interest over four straight years. JetBlue said the AP’s way of screening for zombies isn’t fair to airlines because big purchases of aircraft “are an intrinsic part of the business model” that cut into profits and don’t reflect a company’s true health. It added that it’s been shoring up its finances recently by cutting costs and putting off purchases of new planes. JetBlue also hasn’t done a major stock buyback in more than three years. In some cases, borrowed cash has gone straight into the pockets of controlling shareholders and wealthy family owners. In Britain, the Glazer family that owns much of the Premier League’s Manchester United soccer franchise loaded up the company with debt in 2005, then got the team to borrow hundreds of millions a few years later. At the same time, the family had the team pay dividends to shareholders, including $165 million to the Glazers themselves, while its stadium, the Old Trafford, fell into disrepair. “They’ve papered over the cracks but we’ve been in decline for more than a decade,” fan lobbying group head Chris Rumfitt said after a recent downpour sent water cascading from the upper stands in what spectators dubbed “Trafford Falls.” “There have been zero investments in infrastructure.” The Glazers, who separately own the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, recently brought in a new part owner at Manchester United who has promised to inject $300 million into the business. The stock is falling anyway, down 20% so far this year to $16.25, no higher than it was a decade ago. Manchester United declined to comment. Zombie collapses wouldn’t be so scary if robust spending by governments, consumers and larger, more stable companies could act as a cushion. But they also piled up debt. The U.S. government is expected spend $870 billion this year on interest on its debt alone, up a third in a year and more than it spends on defense. In South Korea, consumers are tapped out as credit card and other household debt hit fresh records. In the U.K., homeowners are missing payments on their mortgages at a rate not seen in years. A real concern among investors is that too many zombies could collapse at the same time because central banks kept them on life support with low interest rates for years instead of allowing failures to sprinkle out over time, similar to the way allowing small forest fires to burn dry brush helps prevent an inferno. “They’ve created a tinderbox,” said Spitznagel, founder of Universa Investments. “Any wildfire now threatens the entire ecosystem.” For the first few months of this year, hundreds of zombies refinanced their loans as lenders opened their wallets in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would start cutting in March. That new money helped stocks of more than 1,000 zombies in AP’s analysis rise 20% or more in the past six months across the dozen countries. But many did not or could not refinance, and time is running out. Through the summer and into September, when many investors now expect the first and only Fed cut this year, zombies will have to pay off $1.1 trillion of loans, according to AP’s analysis, two-thirds of the total due by the end of the year. For its calculations, the AP used pre-tax, pre-interest earnings of publicly-traded companies from the database FactSet for both years it studied, 2023 and 2013. The countries selected were the biggest by gross domestic product: the U.S., China, Japan, India, Germany, the U.K., France, Canada, South Korea, Spain, Italy and Australia. The study did not take into account cash in the bank that a company could use to pay its bills or assets it could sell to raise money. The results would also vary if other years were used due to economic conditions and interest rate policies. Still, studies by both the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, an organization for central banks in Switzerland, generally support AP’s findings that zombies have risen sharply. Most of the publicly traded companies in the countries studied — 80% of 34,000 total — are not zombies. These healthier companies tend to be bigger with more cash, and many have reinvested it in higher-yielding bonds and other assets to make up for the higher interest payments now. Many also took advantage of pandemic-era low rates to refinance, pushing out repayment due dates into the future. But the debt hasn’t gone away, and could become a problem for these companies as well if rates don’t fall over the next few years. In 2026, $586 billion in debt is coming due for the companies in the S&P 1500. “They aren’t on anyone’s radar yet, but they are a hurricane. They could be a Category 4 or Category 5 if interest rates don’t go down,” Valens Securities’ Spivey said. “They’re going to lay people off. They’re going to have to cut costs.” Some zombies aren’t waiting. Telecom Italia struck a deal last year to sell its landline network but debt fears continue to push down its stock, so it has moved to put its subsea telecom unit and cell tower business up for sale, too. Radio giant iHeartMedia, after exiting bankruptcy five years ago with less debt, is still struggling to pay what it owes by unloading real estate and radio towers. Its stock has fallen from $16.50 to $1.10 in five years. Exercise company Peloton Interactive has laid off hundreds of workers to help pay debt that has more than quadrupled to $2.3 billion in just five years even though its pretax earnings before the new borrowing weren’t enough to pay interest. Stock that had soared to more than $170 a share during the pandemic recently closed at $3.74. “If rates stay at this level in the near future, we’re going to see more bankruptcies,” said George Cipolloni, a fund manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “At some point the money comes due and they’re not going to have it. It’s game over.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

3,"François Candelon, I. Glenn Cohen, Theodoros Evgeniou, Ke Rong",How AI can enable cross-border data sharing in a fragmenting world,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/ai-artificial-intelligence-cross-border-data-sharing/,"When it comes to data sharing in the AI era, policymakers need to ensure that the rules of the game reflect the realities of the tech.",2024-06-07T09:30:00Z,"Whether preparing for the next pandemic or monitoring the safety of generative AI, policymakers, business leaders, and academics need access to data from both within and outside their national borders. But instead of policies that enable data to flow more freely, constraints have become the norm. Globally, data flow restrictions more than doubled between 2017 and 2021. Late last year, the U.S. withdrew its long-standing request for the WTO to prohibit data localization requirements for e-commerce. This is a highly symbolic move from a country that has traditionally been one of the staunchest supporters of tearing down barriers in the digital world. As a result of these shifts, the digital world has never been more fragmented. But we are not here to argue that all digital barriers must come down. As researchers from academic institutions in the U.S. (Harvard), Europe (INSEAD), and China (Tsinghua), and from a global company (Boston Consulting Group), we recognize that governments will continue to feel an obligation to protect their national security interests and citizens’ data. If anything, we may see more barriers erected in the years to come. But we shouldn’t—in fact, we can’t—give up on cross-border data sharing.  Recent events have illustrated the positive impact of sharing—not only within industries (as we have recently argued) but also across borders. For example, it took Mayo Clinic researchers in the United States just six weeks to calculate the increased risk of mortality from the COVID-19 Delta variant thanks to large-scale studies conducted on patient data from different national databases. This experience, though enabled by the exceptional circumstance of a global pandemic, is still illustrative of the power of sharing. But if the rise in data regulation continues at its current rate, such cross-border data sharing will become more and more difficult. This would have major implications, both on the global economy and on our collective ability to address issues that can only be solved by using data from multiple countries, such as anticipating natural disasters and coordinating responses and global aid, or identifying food safety issues in today’s weakening international supply chains. One powerful solution is to be savvier about the different kinds of data currently available, and the appropriate policy response for each. Public discourse on cross-border data sharing has focused overwhelmingly on raw data. For example, a recent proposal from a Canadian think tank recommended its use to address issues such as global poverty and terrorism. The same can be observed in discussions on data sharing for trade agreements and in public health. We also see this focus on raw data when it comes to regulation, making the sharing of new forms of data unduly difficult. This is becoming increasingly problematic for the new forms of data that have emerged thanks to recent advances in AI, which can be safer to transfer and share, and which in many contexts can create value without sharing raw data. These new intermediary data types have emerged along the AI pipeline—the process of developing an AI model through a sequence of steps, moving from raw data to final AI solutions. At each step, data is getting transformed or created in ways that can both alleviate regulators’ worries and enable their problem-solving.   For example, raw data must first be transformed into a format that can be used effectively by machine learning models. The results of this transformation, called features and embeddings, often capture critical insights from raw data, and they get increasingly difficult to reverse-engineer as we move up the AI chain of data processing—especially as new privacy preserving methods are being developed. This could have powerful implications in many sectors, including health care. Embeddings can represent raw medical records, minimizing the risk of patient reidentification and protecting confidentiality while enabling entities to share medical data across borders to, for example, accelerate responses to emerging global public health threats. Valuable data can also be derived from the choices developers make when designing models, including hyperparameters (which guide how a machine learning model learns during training) and weights (the numerical values that help the model make its predictions). The sharing of such “model data” can accelerate the replication of models without sharing actual training data. For example, financial institutions in different countries seeking to improve their fraud prevention models could share these intermediate data without exposing sensitive information about their individual customers—resulting in a significantly more robust fraud detection system than if each bank relied only on its own data.  AI models are also able to create artificial data, so-called “synthetic data,” that can in turn be used to train other AI models in lieu of raw data. Because synthetic datasets are artificial, yet retain the patterns of the original raw data, they could be shared across borders without exposing sensitive information. Returning to the previous example, financial institutions could generate synthetic datasets comprised of imaginary customers and transactions that still display their real customers’ collective behavioral patterns. Sharing different types of data assets resulting from the AI pipeline can overcome some of the traditional barriers to data sharing. Of course, new challenges will likely emerge as the space of possibilities expands. But the crucial point is that such data assets will require different policies and sharing tools and frameworks tailored to their technical features.   However, today’s regulations do not account for all these new and emerging intermediary data categories. For instance, the global trade of certain data-driven services, such as in the financial or telecommunications spaces, is still regulated in part by agreements that predate the internet era—and, as such, don’t take into consideration new data categories. Instead, these categories tend to be treated like raw data—which means they are heavily restricted. And without urgent action, they are bound to be even more restricted over time. With the advance of increasingly powerful AI, intermediary data types need to be regulated in a way that account for their specificities, such as their distinct use, value, or privacy-preserving features. Robust policies that make these distinctions will enable countries to share critical data on a larger scale, addressing pressing global issues while protecting citizens’ personal data. When it comes to data sharing, as with other innovations tied to the rapid development of AI, policymakers need to ensure that the rules of the game reflect the realities of the tech. There’s too much value at stake for a world confronted by global challenges and in ever-greater need of cross-border collaboration. *** Read other Fortune columns by François Candelon.

4,"Yoolim Lee, Bloomberg",Samsung's largest union goes on strike for the first time in the company's 55-year history,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/07/samsung-largest-union-goes-on-strike-first-time-pay-bonus-dispute/,"While employees will be back to work after the weekend, union leaders aren't ruling out further strikes if pay negotiations remain stalled.",2024-06-07T06:46:30Z,"The largest union at Samsung Electronics Co. went on a strike for the first time in the company’s 55-year history, with the standoff over pay so entrenched that the two sides have stopped all discussions.  The National Samsung Electronics Union, the largest of the tech giant’s several unions with some 28,400 workers, encouraged members to take a single day off on Friday, which falls between a Thursday public holiday and the weekend. They plan to resume normal work hours next week. “This is a soft start and a symbolic move,” Lee Hyun-kuk, deputy secretary general of the union told Bloomberg News. “But we have plans for subsequent strikes if the management refuses to communicate. We are not ruling out an all-out general strike.” Union leaders gathered on Friday in front of Samsung’s office building in Seoul, with one speaking to a local television station. A bus draped in an enormous white protest banner was parked at the site. Placards carried worker appeals, but the crowd was largely muted. That contrasts with violent walkouts at carmakers that were common in South Korea in the past. In 2009, workers at Ssangyong Motor Co. took control of a plant for months, using iron pipes and Molotov cocktails to battle police armed with tear gas and water cannons. The head of the [hotlink]Hyundai Motor[/hotlink] Labor Union even cut off part of his little finger to express his will to obtain the most favorable outcome in the labor-management negotiations. At the heart of the dispute now are bonus payments for Samsung laborers. Workers in the company’s semiconductor division didn’t receive such extra payments last year, when the unit lost about 15 trillion won. They fear they may not get bonuses again this year even if the division returns to profit, said union leader Son Woo-mok.  Samsung calculates workers’ bonuses with a complex formula that deducts its cost of capital from operating profit, adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. The union is asking the company to simply use operating profit like some of its peers—or to be much more transparent in how it determines those numbers, according to union leaders.  Historically, bonuses make up a significant portion of worker pay. So missing out on such money can mean a meaningful reduction in compensation. The dispute is really about whether Samsung will prioritize profits for shareholders or contributions from workers, according to Kwun Seog Kyeun, a former business school professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “The company has been and will continue to be in good faith in negotiations with the union,” Samsung Electronics said in a statement, adding that there has been no impact on production or management activities. It also said the number of workers off on Friday is less than the comparable day last year. Union leaders said it wouldn’t be possible to count the number of workers joining the one-day strike because they’re not obligated to report that to the union. Some non-unionized employees are taking the long weekend too, making it even more difficult to determine the size of the walkout.  In March, Samsung’s labor-management council agreed to increase this year’s pay by 5.1% after narrowing their differences over several rounds of negotiations. The company has historically set pay increases through a council consisting of representatives from both sides. But the agreement was called off in the most recent talks because management didn’t agree to an additional paid day off they demanded, according to union leaders. The strike comes as Samsung grapples with a set of challenges. In 2023, its operating profit plunged to a 15-year low as its chip division lost money. Smaller rival SK Hynix Inc. stole a lead in the suddenly scorching-hot market for high-bandwidth memory chips, essential for training artificial intelligence models.  Samsung’s share price, one of the most popular holdings in the country, is down about 1% since the start of the year. On average, about one in 10 South Koreans own a Samsung share, though about 1 million frustrated retail investors dumped Samsung stock in 2023.  Lee Kun Hee, late chairman of Samsung, went to great lengths to prevent unions from forming. Jay Y. Lee, who later succeeded his father, ​​apologized in 2020 for “all those who have been hurt in labor issues,” and vowed to renounce Samsung’s decades-old “no union” philosophy.  Analysts see Samsung’s tight control of labor activism as one reason for its success while other conglomerates, like Hyundai, were often challenged by militant labor activism at their work sites. ​ Union leaders and analysts see little impact on Samsung’s production lines of chips and electronics from Friday’s strike.   “This strike will not impact DRAM and NAND Flash production, nor will it cause any shipment shortages,” TrendForce said in a report last week. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

5,Ryan Hogg,‘Real-life Martha’ from Baby Reindeer sues Netflix for $170M over ‘biggest lie in television history’,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/07/real-life-baby-reindeer-netflix-170-million-biggest-lie-television-history/,Fiona Harvey claims she has been unable to leave her home after being falsely accused of stalking through the Netflix hit.,2024-06-07T11:22:25Z,"The woman claiming to be the stalker portrayed in the Netflix hit Baby Reindeer has brought a $170 million lawsuit against the streaming giant. Fiona Harvey is suing Netflix, arguing the show falsely accuses her of being a convicted stalker and has left her with severe emotional distress, unable to leave her home. Richard Gadd created Baby Reindeer after a successful stage run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It has proved a hit on the platform and currently ranks in the top 10 streamed shows on Netflix. The show follows Donny Dunn, a stand-up comedian and bartender who offers a woman named Martha a free cup of tea at the bar he works at in the London borough of Camden, out of sympathy. Martha proceeds to send Dunn a flurry of emails and to stalk him. But Harvey, who claims to be the real-life inspiration behind the Martha character, is now pursuing Netflix for a nine-figure defamation claim. At the beginning of the series, Baby Reindeer is described as a “true story” by its creator. This, Harvey’s lawyer argued in a lawsuit filed in California Thursday, is the “biggest lie in television history.” “It is a lie told by Netflix and the show’s creator, Richard Gadd, out of greed and lust for fame; a lie designed to attract more viewers, get more attention, to make more money, and to viciously destroy the life of Plaintiff, Fiona Harvey—an innocent woman defamed by Netflix and Richard Gadd at a magnitude and scale without precedent,” the lawyers wrote. A representative for Netflix didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. A spokesperson told the Financial Times that the streaming giant intends to “defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.” Gadd has never confirmed that Martha is based on Harvey.  Speaking to Variety, Gadd said the series was “all emotionally 100% true,” but described how elements of the show were fabricated for narrative purposes, while names were changed to protect people’s identities.  He added that Martha had to be different from his alleged real-life stalker for legal reasons. However, once the show aired, fans were quick to begin connecting the dots between the events described in Baby Reindeer and Gadd’s own life, with Harvey the first casualty. A reference in the show to “hanging curtains” was discovered in a tweet sent by Harvey to Gadd in 2014.  Lawyers say that after this revelation, Harvey was swarmed with messages and calls asking if she was the real-life inspiration for Martha. “Harvey is fearful of leaving her home or checking the news. As a direct result of Baby Reindeer, Harvey has become extremely secluded and isolated, in fear of the public, going days without leaving her home,” lawyers wrote. Harvey maintains she didn’t stalk Gadd, and that the fact she claims to have been identified as the real face behind Martha amounts to defamation. As the series progresses, Gadd’s character develops a mutual obsession with Martha when she goes silent after he goes to the police. Lawyers have pointed to these instances to enforce their defamation claims. The lawyers also argue Netflix failed to do any due diligence and failed to contact Harvey to confirm whether she was a convicted stalker, which the character Martha is. The $170 million claim includes actual and compensatory damages, the proceeds of profits made from Baby Reindeer, and punitive damages. There has also been speculation as to the origins of Darrien O’Connor, a producer who abuses Gadd’s character throughout the series. Gadd was forced to publicly defend one producer after fans began speculating online that he was the inspiration for Darrien. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

6,Eva Roytburg,"American Airlines flight attendants say their pay is so low, they fight for airplane meals to save money and sleep in their cars—and they're ready to strike",https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/american-airlines-flight-attendants-say-their-pay-is-so-low-they-fight-for-airplane-meals-to-save-money-and-sleep-in-their-cars-and-theyre-ready-to-strike/,American Airlines and their flight attendants’ union will head to Washington for negotiations next week.,2024-06-08T11:10:00Z,"American Airlines recently offered to hike flight attendants’ pay 17%—but the workers say that won’t be enough to stop the first airline strike in 15 years.  As the airline and its attendants negotiate, American CEO Robert Isom this week sent a video message offering a 17% wage increase, just enough to push new Boston and Miami flight attendants above food stamp eligibility. The airline said the pay increase would take effect immediately and claimed it is not “asking anything from the union in return,” an unusual move, Isom said in the video message, which was confirmed by an American Airlines spokesperson. “But these are unusual times.”  Still, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) rejected the offer, calling it a “PR move” ahead of strike negotiations that will take place between American Airlines and the union next week.  APFA and American Airlines have been in negotiations over a new contract on and off since the previous one expired in 2019, APFA president Julie Hedrick told Fortune.  “We’re behind on everything,” Hedrick said. She cited low wages and low pay for food expenses on trips as the most pressing issues. When flight attendants go on domestic trips, they receive an additional $2.20 an hour for food expenses; for international flights, they receive $2.50. These numbers are “very behind” what food actually costs today, Hedrick said.  Since 2014, when the previous contract was negotiated, flight attendants have been left with measly starting salaries even as inflation has shot up 33%, Hedrick said. According to an employment verification letter from American, which circulated on Reddit a few weeks ago, an entry-level flight attendant can expect to make $27,315 a year, before taxes. (Like many airlines, American pays its attendants only for the time the plane is in the air. Boarding passengers, waiting between flights, and traveling to and from the airport all mean flight attendants typically work about two hours for each “flight hour” they are paid.)  With American’s proposed 17% increase, the starting wage jumps to $31,959 per year, or $35.5 per flight hour. That rate pushes junior flight attendants who live alone above the level for qualifying for food stamps in states like Massachusetts or Florida.  Most new flight attendant hires are required to live in cities like Dallas, Miami, and New York, which have high costs of living that they cannot afford, Hedrick noted.  American flight attendants are sleeping in their cars, she said. Some of them fight for trips just for the chance to eat the plane meals, if the pilots don’t take their meals first.  “Our new hire flight attendants are struggling,” Hedrick said, adding that new hires most strongly rejected the 17% hike. For these attendants, lagging pay adds insult to injury when seen against the backdrop of the post-pandemic years, which exacerbated longstanding issues in the industry including staffing shortage, long hours, and unruly passengers, some of whom assault airline staff.  That’s leading to record burnout among attendants.  “We have picketed for a year and a half, and we’ve done at least 11 pickets,” Hedrick said. “Our flight attendants have demonstrated our resolve and our solidarity to get a contract, an industry-meeting contract that we deserve, and we will take nothing less.” APFA is proposing a raise of 33%—in line with the rise in inflation since 2014—with a cap at $91 per hour during the first year of a new contract, with pay raises for each year after. An American Airlines spokesperson told Fortune that the video message “represents the latest from American.” They did not answer questions about the proposal or the upcoming negotiations.  Of the 39 separate issues on the table, such as sick leave or crew rest, APFA and American have reached a “tentative agreement” on 25. The other 14 are associated with compensation, expenses, vacations, and other terms of agreement.  Union leaders face an uphill battle as they head to Washington next week to negotiate. Airline strikes are exceedingly rare; the last one occurred in 2010, when Spirit Airlines pilots went on strike for five days.  That’s because railway and airline workers are not allowed to strike unless given the green light by federal mediator groups, via the 1926 Railway Labor Act. One such group, the National Mediation Board, will oversee the American Airlines negotiations, and can allow a strike to occur if it finds that the groups are at an impasse. Still, the federal government can also block a strike—as happened in December 2022, when President Joe Biden signed a measure passed by Congress to impose a contract between rail companies and workers that many workers had rejected.  Biden, who has called himself “the most pro-union president” in history, enforced the agreement to avoid an “economic catastrophe” during the holidays, he said at the time. With multiple major railroad companies at threat of an industrywide strike, the stakes for an agreement were extremely high; $2 billion could have been lost every day of a strike.  The stakes for a possible strike at American are less dire, since other major carriers would not be affected. But American attendants aren’t the only one calling for wage hikes. United Airlines is still negotiating a new contract with their flight attendants. Southwest Airlines, in April, approved a contract that includes pay raises totaling more than 33% over four years. The union representing Southwest flight attendants, the Transport Workers Union, said that it provided record gains for flight attendants and sets an industry standard.  APFA, likewise, is asking for a 33% hike, with raises of 5%, 4%, and 4% for the remaining years of a four-year agreement.  The union has also stated that it will not accept any deal without retroactive pay. Last year, American Airlines awarded pilots $230 million in retroactive pay after negotiations with its pilots union.  Hedrick’s message regarding the 17% hike seems to be: We want the whole package, not piecemeal raises.  “Our flight attendants want nothing to do with it,” she said. “They, overwhelmingly, yesterday said, ‘No, we want a contract. We’ve been in negotiations long enough, and it’s time to get this deal done.’” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

7,Sunny Nagpaul,Meet the 59-year-old Barbie ‘dealer’ whose hustle has netted $2 million in sales,https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/barbie-economy-collector-toy-show-ebay/,"Bruce Zalkin has 35 years in the trade and sold one couple's collection for $250,000.",2024-06-08T12:39:00Z,"When Bruce Zalkin, a 59-year-old New York native who has lived in Florida since 1976, looks at even the earliest editions of the original 1959 Barbie, he can detect subtle variations that differentiate a doll worth thousands of dollars and one worth pennies.  The very first version of the doll—with downcast eyes, a curled blonde ponytail and black and white striped swimsuit—has holes in her feet so she can attach to a stand; in the second version, the holes were patched up the after children ended up breaking the stands; the third edition of Barbie wears mascara, while the fourth version is the first made from a vinyl plastic blend rather than polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  Zalkin started his Barbieland journey in his 20s, when he was running a toy shop in Tampa that was filled with cast-iron Tonkin Replica trucks and antiques. It was the early ’90s, and his staff of primarily older women convinced him to focus on the intricacies and allure of Barbie dolls instead.  “They taught me all about Barbies,” Zalkin told Fortune, “everything I wanted to know and more.”  Zalkin has now been selling Barbie dolls for over 30 years, developing a talent for discerning the subtle differences between the earliest versions of Mattel’s star bombshell. But he has been unofficially selling toys, learning the trade from influential women in his life, since much younger: At age 5, his grandmother taught him about her hobby, collecting glassware, pottery and figurines in his hometown of Liberty, New York; at 13, after his family moved to Tampa, he decided that was “old lady stuff,” and began buying and selling toys instead.  His 40-year-long career as an antique toy dealer now deals primarily with Barbie collections—mostly vintage models with alluring downcast eyes and feathery blonde ponytails. Over the years, Zalkin estimates he’s sold  $2 million worth of vintage Barbies, working through eBay, toy shows, and auctions. While it’s not a profession he encourages others to join (it’s “just not a good investment,” he says), he’s managed to lean into the charm, variety and nuance of the doll—along with its lucrative market power—to create a sustainable livelihood.  “I’m not really a collector of Barbies, I’m more of a dealer,” he told Fortune. “This is how I make my living.”  Buyers of his vintage Barbies include those nostalgic to own the dolls they grew up with, or weren’t allowed to buy, along with professional collectors.  “There’s the kids that grew up with parents who would never buy them a Barbie doll,” Zalkin said. Then there are specific lines geared toward collectors that Mattel introduced in the 1980s—including limited-edition dolls designed by esteemed fashion designer Bob Mackie and silkstone models, which were released in the 2000s. Those often sport lingerie and, Zalkin says, “were never meant for children.”   They are, however, “highly sought by collectors” and can fetch as much as $400 on eBay. Spotting the right collections can take work, as the rare dolls Zalkin hunts for aren’t easily found at yard sales or on social media.  This week, Zalkin viewed a Florida woman’s collection of over 150 dolls, which she decided to sell as she’s moving, and because her child has outgrown them. Zalkin brought along Marl Davidson, a friend of 38 years whom he calls “the number one dealer in the world.”  Going through the dolls, Zalkin said, “she didn’t have any super rare items,” but luckily for him, the majority of dolls were vintage, which means they were released before the 1980s.  Zalkin and Davidson spent around $4,000 to buy the collection. Once purchased, the duo then spent about two hours packing the dolls, wrapping them individually in paper or plastic (so “we don’t mess up their hair”) and making ziplock bags of the dolls’ accessories.  Next comes the following phase of the dolls’ journey: rehoming. “It will take a few months to sort through,” Zalkin said. “We bought 100 pairs of shoes, all in little baggies, that have to be sorted to see whether they’re vintage or modern, because people pay very different amounts of money depending on what they are.”  The accessories, he said, often sell for more than pieces of clothing and at times even the dolls themselves, because “those are the first things that get lost or vacuumed up.”  The answer, Zalkin said, usually depends on how much she was loved, the rarity of the edition, and whether her clothes sport Mattel’s signature hot pink Barbie tag.  “Even to this day, all the clothing is tagged,” he said. In the 1960s, he added, “Mattel sold pattern books so that women could make clothes for the Barbies, because it was cheaper to do that than buy the Mattel clothes.” The rarity of Barbie clothes and editions can be the difference between a doll worth pennies and upwards $5,000.  In the 1960s, for example, Mattel came out with a line of Barbies that was only available in Japan. Clothes from that line, Zalkin said, “are super-expensive and super rare. I’ve only had a few of those outfits and they sell in the multi-thousands range.”   Zalkin has sold individual dolls for $10,000. He recalled one octogenarian couple’s lifetime collection— over 500 “mint condition, original dolls and clothing still in the original packages”—which he sold for $250,000, mostly to private collectors. Vintage Barbies, and specifically the earliest versions of the doll, tend to be the most valuable. An original 1959 Barbie, in perfect condition, is worth between $5,000 to $10,000, Zalkin said.  “You’ll have some people collecting for investment or they want mint perfect items, and they’re going to pay the top premium for it,” he said. “Other collectors just want the doll, get it at one-tenth of the price, and they’ll redo the makeup, redo the hair and have the doll they want.” To be sure, the line of work is not without challenges. One of the biggest, Zalkin said, is finding collections, or inventory, to buy. He finds the majority of his business through word of mouth, with websites like Facebook Marketplace and Craiglist only accounting for a small fraction of his sales. He also often buys back collections from people he’s made sales with over the decades he’s been in the trade, who reach out to him after life events, like death or divorce, prompt them to part ways with their collections.  Greta Gerwig’s highly-anticipated Barbie movie, released last year, has lured more collectors to enter the market. Dolls that were featured in the movie, specifically ‘Pregnant Midge’ and ‘Growing up Skipper’ (which has a twistable arm that makes her grow taller and her chest expand) doubled in price.  “Right when the movie came out, there was a huge uptick in Barbie sales,” he said, adding that the prices still haven’t returned to pre-movie levels.  According to estimates by Barbie Wiki, a fandom website, there are over 100,000 Barbie collectors over the world.  “Primarily older women are the main market, either new collectors, because of the new movie, or older women whose brothers blew up their dolls with GI Joe, or had parents who sold them in a yard sale,” Zalkin said. “Believe it or not, the gay men’s community also buys a lot of Barbie dolls.”  For better or worse, Barbie is an undoubtable cultural icon. She’s been the centerpiece of  museum exhibitions and was the subject of a documentary on Hulu. Gerwig’s movie brought close to $1.3 billion at the worldwide box office, becoming one of the few female-dominated movies among the top-grossing films of all time, NPR reported.  The doll was also a game changer for both toymakers and young kids alike. According to a history by Encyclopedia Britannica, baby dolls were the norm in the early 1950s, and often encouraged young girls to envision themselves as nurturers, mothers or caregivers. Barbie, however, was marketed as a woman of many careers—like hospital volunteer, astronaut, surgeon, and CEO—with outfits to match. When kids played with her, they could imagine themselves in careers that don’t have enough female representation. Still, the dollmaker faced pushback for setting unrealistic body standards. Researchers in Finland concluded that if a real woman had the proportions of the doll, she wouldn’t have enough body fat to menstruate.  Between 2012 and 2018, Mattel faced several quarters of nosediving sales and criticism continued as other companies manufactured dolls that better reflected the diversity of Americans in size, color and physical ability.  In the mid-2010s, after Mattel released more diverse dolls, sales turned up. According to Mattel’s website, Barbie is now “the most diverse doll line,” available in 35 skin tones, 97 hairstyles, and 9 body types.” The brand has since released dolls with disabilities, such as Down syndrome, prosthetic legs and wheelchairs.  It’s been decades since Zalkin first dove into the world of Barbie as a seller, but he has no plans of turning away. He’s recently started his own auction site, partly to avoid eBay’s rising seller fees, and counts over 150 toy shows under his belt, which he runs with his wife, Laura. “When we’re at a buying show, we’ll be sitting behind tables as people come to sell their stuff,” he said. “Naturally, if they have Barbie dolls, they’ll walk over to my wife, who says, ‘my husband does Barbies. I do all the cast iron trucks.’”   © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, adding to opposition for the carmaker ahead of its annual general meeting next week. “We remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,” Norges Bank Investment Management – the official name of the fund – said in a statement Saturday.  The vote at next week’s AGM will be the second time Musk’s pay package has been put before shareholders. A judge voided an initial vote that approved the package in 2018. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have recommended investors reject the proposal. NBIM also voted against the pay package in 2018, though about three-quarters of investors backed it at the time. A Delaware judge voided the deal earlier this year, saying investors weren’t fully informed of key details. The decision is “consistent with our vote on the same award in 2018,” the Norwegian fund said, adding it will “continue to seek constructive dialog with Tesla on this and other topics.”  The outcome of the shareholder vote is only advisory, though a loss would be a major embarrassment to Tesla’s board and to its top executive. Musk has also threatened to build products outside of Tesla if he can’t increase his equity holdings in the company, something the pay deal would allow him to do. While NBIM said it would vote in favor of a management proposal to move the company’s corporate home to Texas from Delaware, it plans to back a shareholder proposal calling on Tesla to adopt new policies related to collective bargaining and freedom of association. The latter proposal, a response to an almost seven-month long strike by Swedish Tesla technicians, is being supported by several of the Nordic region’s biggest asset owners. Tesla has urged shareholders to vote against it, saying “the company is already committed to protecting its employees’ rights.” NBIM owned a 0.98% holding worth $7.72 billion in Tesla as of the end of 2023, according to its website. It issues its voting intentions five days before the AGMs of the companies it invests in.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The 91-year-old was charged Friday with five crimes including rape, indecent assault on a female, sexual assault and forcible confinement, Peel Regional Police said. He was released with conditions and will appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton, Ontario, at a later date, the police statement said. Peel Regional Police Constable Tyler Bell said there is more than one accuser but declined to say how many. “Obviously, this is a high-profile case. Our special victims unit is bound to protect the victims and in doing so that’s why were are being vague,” Bell said. “There is more than one victim but we won’t confirm that number yet.” Police allege the sexual assaults occurred from the 1980s to as recent as 2023. Bell said they are appealing for people to come forward if they have information or have been victims. Stronach didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. He has hired prominent Canadian defense lawyer Brian Greenspan. “Mr. Stronach categorically denies the allegations of impropriety which have been brought against him,” Greenspan said in an e-mail. “He looks forward to the opportunity to fully respond to the charges and to maintain his legacy both as a philanthropist and as an icon of the Canadian business community.” Stronach, born in Austria, became one of Canada’s wealthiest people by creating Magna in his garage in 1957 and building it into one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto parts. He also founded The Stronach Group, a company specializing in horse racing. He made a brief foray into Austrian politics more than a decade ago and has been named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors. A Magna spokesperson said Stronach has had no affiliation with the company since relinquishing control in 2010. “We have recently been made aware of the charges filed against Frank Stronach,” Dave Niemiec said in an email Friday evening. “Magna has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media.” Niemiec said the company would not comment further on the ongoing legal matter. In 2018, Stronach sued his daughter, two grandchildren and former business associate Alon Ossip for over $500 million in Ontario Superior Court alleging they mismanaged the family’s assets which he wanted to take back control of. Belinda Stronach, a former Canadian Member of Parliament, countersued her father, saying in a statement of defense that he lost vast sums of money on pet projects. The case was later settled. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

10,"Michael Casey, The Associated Press",Fury road: Cities are seizing illegal mopeds and scooters amid backlash against delivery drivers,https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/delivery-drivers-mopeds-scooters-police-seizure-doordash-grubhub-uber-eats/,"Cities are issuing warning letters, seizing illegally registered or driven vehicles, and launching special street patrols to enforce speed limits against delivery drivers.",2024-06-08T15:40:32Z,"A soaring demand for food delivered fast has spawned small armies of couriers — and increasing alarm — in big cities where scooters, motorcycles and mopeds zip in and out of traffic and hop onto pedestrian-filled sidewalks as their drivers race to drop off salads and sandwiches. Officials in Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., have started cracking down on delivery companies by issuing warning letters, seizing illegally registered or driven vehicles, and launching special street patrols to enforce speed limits. The pushback is not limited to the U.S.: There have also been a series of crackdowns in London and other British cities. For their part, the delivery companies have pledged to work with city officials to ensure that all of their drivers operate both legally and safely. In a letter this week to food delivery companies DoorDash, Grubhub and Uber, Boston officials cited an “alarming increase in unlawful and dangerous operation of motorcycles, mopeds and motorized scooters” that they said put the drivers, other motorists and pedestrians “in imminent danger.” The letter alleged that some drivers were operating unregistered vehicles and breaking traffic laws, and warned of an imminent crackdown on the vehicles. It also demanded that the companies explain how they can ensure their drivers are operating safely. The Massachusetts State Police said they identified dozens of mopeds and scooters that were improperly registered or being operated by unlicensed drivers. Fourteen illegal mopeds and scooters were seized Wednesday in one Boston neighborhood alone. In New York City, authorities have seized 13,000 scooters and mopeds so far this year; on Wednesday, they crushed more than 200 illegal mopeds and other delivery vehicles. Authorities in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, launched a program Wednesday called Operation Ride Right to ensure drivers of two-wheeled vehicles are complying with the law. Since it began, authorities have made five arrests and impounded 17 mopeds. “They have terrorized many of our pedestrians, particularly our senior and older adults,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Wednesday at an event in which motorized two-wheeled delivery vehicles were destroyed. “Riders who think the rules don’t apply to them, they’re going to see an aggressive enforcement policy that’s in place.” When food delivery services had their major resurgence during the COVID-19 pandemic, most drivers used cars to deliver their fare. That led to increased traffic congestion, prompting a shift to motorcycles and other two-wheeled modes of transportation. The drivers, many of them immigrants from Latin American countries but also from West Africa and South Asia, say they are just trying to earn a living and are providing a service that gets customers their food fast. “We’re not all bad,” said Luis López, a delivery driver from the Dominican Republic who spoke to The Associated Press on Friday from his motorcycle in an area of multiple fast-food restaurants near the Boston Public Library. “We come to work, to earn a living, pay the rent and send something to our families.” López, who came to the U.S. about three years ago, acknowledged that some drivers are unlicensed or driving unregistered vehicles, and he’s seen them running red lights and onto sidewalks, menacing pedestrians. Some people are so reckless that they’re also putting other delivery drivers at risk, he said. He said he was among a group of 10 delivery drivers outside a Chick-fil-A on Thursday night when a police officer approached them with a flyer describing how to register their scooters and mopeds. The whole group agreed to do just that. “We have to respect the law,” he said, speaking in Spanish. “We are going to respect the law so that they let us work here.” Drivers of motorized two-wheeled vehicles are coming under much more scrutiny than was faced years ago by other gig workers in cars, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, because they can more easily violate traffic laws, said Hilary Robinson, an associate professor of law and sociology at Northeastern University. The switch to the vehicles “is really an attempt to make low-wage, high-risk labor available so that all of us can have cheap goods and services,” Robinson said. “It’s perhaps one of the reasons why people are starting to realize that there really is no such thing as a free lunch.” William Medina, a delivery worker in New York who is also an organizing leader with the Los Deliveristas Unidos Campaign, blames the delivery companies. “This is a problem that started because the companies force you to complete the deliveries from far distances,” he said in a telephone interview Friday. Medina started out delivering food on a bicycle, switched to an electric bike, and now is using a moped to make the longer trips. “If you have to complete the delivery 6 miles, 7 miles, you have to complete it,” he said. Among those advocating for tougher enforcement in Boston is City Councilor Edward Flynn, who said on Facebook that it “can no longer be the Wild West on the streets of Boston.” “Everyone using city roads needs to abide by the rules of the road. If you’re able to go 25 mph like a car — you should be licensed, registered, and carry liability insurance in the event of an accident and injury,” he wrote. Some Boston residents are supportive of tougher action against the scooters. “I get frustrated when they don’t follow the traffic laws,” said Anne Kirby, a 25-year-old student having lunch in a Boston neighborhood within a few hundred feet of several scooters. “I feel like I almost get hit every day when they go through the crosswalk when it’s not their turn to go.” But Jaia Samuel, a 25-year-old hospital worker from Boston, was more conflicted. She said she agreed that delivery scooters can be dangerous, but she also acknowledged that she relies heavily on delivery services for her food. “I do think it’s unsafe to an extent, the weaving in between cars and the not stopping for red lights,” she said. “But I feel like everybody should be able to make a living, so who am I to say anything? It would be unfortunate for me. I would be taking a hit with the crackdown on them. I order a lot of Uber Eats, DoorDash.” Three major food delivery services have pledged to work with officials and neighborhood advocates to address the problem. “The overwhelming majority of Dashers do the right thing and like all drivers must follow the rules of the road. If they don’t, then they face consequences — just like anyone else,” DoorDash said in a statement Wednesday. Grubhub said its employees already agree to obey all local traffic laws. “While enforcement of the law is best handled by the police, we take safety seriously and will take action to address any reports of unsafe driving,” the company said in a statement Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

11,"Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press",This couple came to the U.S. as refugees and started a restaurant. It’s now a finalist for the culinary world’s top prize,https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/restaurant-success-refugee-immigrant-entrepreneurs-chefs-james-beard-award-finalists/,"Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, who fled Burundi about a decade ago and now own Baobab Fare in Detroit.",2024-06-09T14:45:20Z,"An East African eatery in Detroit, longtime family owned Seattle pho shops and a Palestinian chef using ancient cooking techniques in Washington, D.C., are among the dozens of finalists for this year’s prestigious James Beard Awards. The culinary world’s equivalent of the Oscars will recognize restaurants and chefs in 22 categories at a ceremony set for Monday in Chicago. The nominees cover a diverse range of cuisine and chef experience, a recent shift following turbulent, pandemic-era years for the James Beard Foundation. The most-anticipated categories include awards for outstanding restaurateur, chef and restaurant. Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, who fled Burundi about a decade ago and now own Baobab Fare in Detroit, are among five finalists in the outstanding restaurateur category. The couple faced a difficult road as refugees opening a business in the U.S. Their restaurant’s menu features kuku, pan-fried chicken in a tangy mustard-onion sauce that’s served with fried plantains, stewed yellow beans and coconut rice. “We inspire a lot of refugees — refugees who are coming to this country without hope and one day thinking that they can win this kind of title,” Mamba said. “It’s a big deal for us, because we want to show people that this world can be equal.” The James Beard Foundation has bestowed awards since 1991, except in 2020 and 2021 when the organization scrapped them as the restaurant industry was reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. The foundation was also facing criticism over a lack of racial diversity and allegations about some nominees’ behavior. Foundation officials vowed to improve ethical standards and be more “reflective of the industry.” Restaurants apply for the awards. Judges, who mostly remain anonymous, try the cuisine before voting. Nominees are reviewed for the food as well as for a behavioral “code of ethics,” including how employees are treated. “We are looking at the whole plate,” said Tanya Holland, chair of the awards committee. For restaurants, just being a finalist can bring wide recognition and boost business. Restaurant awards have become less common in recent years, giving the James Beard Awards even more weight, said Paul Freedman, a Yale University professor whose expertise includes food history. “It really calls attention to restaurants that might not be all that well known outside their region,” he said. A Seattle family credited with bringing the first pho shop to the city in the 1980s is also a finalist for outstanding restaurateur with a trio of pho restaurants and their chicken and rice shop called The Boat. Yenvy Pham, whose parents opened their first restaurant after immigrating from Vietnam, calls a bowl of their pho, with its beefy bone broth and anise and clove aromatics, a “sure thing.” They make the soup fresh every day over 24 hours. “It’s wild,” she said. “It’s a great honor.” The other restaurateur finalists are Chris Viaud with three restaurants in New Hampshire, Hollis Wells Silverman with the Eastern Point Collective that runs several Washington, D.C., restaurants, and Erika and Kelly Whitaker for restaurants in Boulder, Colorado. Some finalists are already lauded, including Michael Rafidi, whose Washington, D.C., restaurant Albi was awarded a coveted Michelin Star in 2022. He is among five finalists for outstanding chef. Albi, which is Arabic for “my heart,” pays homage to Rafidi’s Palestinian roots by using Old World food preparation techniques. Everything is cooked over charcoal, including grape leaves stuffed with lamb and sfeeha, a meat pie. “There’s a mission for me to continue to spread light and cook Palestinian food,” he said. Another finalist for outstanding chef is David Uygur, who runs a tiny Italian restaurant in Dallas. Lucia features fresh pasta made in house and a popular cured meat board. The menu changes seasonally. Uygur, whose father is Turkish, became interested in Italian food because of love. His high school sweetheart, now wife, loved Italian cuisine. He wanted his restaurant, with just nine tables, to feel intimate. “I wanted the restaurant to feel like someone was coming to eat our house,” he said. “I wanted our guests in our home.” Other outstanding chef finalists include Sarah Minnick for Lovely’s Fifty Fifty in Portland, Oregon, Dean Neff of Seabird in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Renee Touponce for The Port of Call in Mystic, Connecticut. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

12,Jason Ma,"'Bond King' Bill Gross is about to make a killing on his stamp collection, but he thinks the market is due for a correction and is getting out",https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/bond-king-bill-gross-record-stamp-collection-auction-market-correction/,"The Robert A. Siegel auction house said ""this collection promises to set a new high-water mark for stamp collecting when it crosses the auction block.""",2024-06-09T21:53:31Z,"Legendary bond investor Bill Gross amassed a hoard of rare U.S. stamps that’s reputed to be the most complete collection ever—and he’s about to sell them off. On Friday and Saturday, the Robert A. Siegel auction house will put the stamps up for sale individually with estimates for the total haul at $15 million to $20 million, which would set a record for U.S. stamps. In a video teasing the auction, Siegel said “this collection promises to set a new high-water mark for stamp collecting when it crosses the auction block.” The star of the collection is a “Z Grill” stamp from 1868 that has a face value of one cent and is expected to fetch $4 million to $5 million, which also would also mark a new record for a U.S. stamp. But according to the Financial Times, Gross believes a correction is headed for the stamp market and is getting out. Whereas the stamp market used to have a “fundamental base of kids” to support it, “that doesn’t exist any more,” the cofounder of bond giant PIMCO told the FT. Gross has already sold $50 million in stamps in recent years, including a collection of U.K. postage that set a record, too, the report said. Meanwhile, he is still opining on financial markets in interviews, newsletters, and social media. Last month, he said the bond market would suffer more if Donald Trump returns to the White House than if Joe Biden is reelected.  “Trump is the more bearish of the candidates simply because his programs advocate continued tax cuts and more expensive things,” Gross told the FT, later adding that “Trump’s election would be more disruptive.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

13,"Sidhartha Shukla, Bloomberg",Surging cryptocurrency makes Binance's billionaire co-founder even wealthier while locked up in prison,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/09/cryptocurrency-bnb-token-rally-binance-changpeng-zhao-cz-prison-sentence/,"BNB token, a cryptocurrency linked to Binance, has more than doubled in price since the start of the year.",2024-06-09T15:17:37Z,"The BNB token, a cryptocurrency linked to Binance and its incarcerated co-founder Changpeng Zhao, surged to a record high in the first week of his four-month jail sentence in the US.  Its rally underscores Zhao’s status as the richest person ever to do time in a US federal lock up. Zhao reported to a prison in California on Tuesday to begin a four-month sentence for failing to properly safeguard the world’s largest crypto exchange against money laundering.   The price of BNB climbed to a peak of $717.48 on Thursday, lifting its market capitalization to $109 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. The token has more than doubled in price since the start of the year.  The trajectory of BNB also reflects the fortunes of Binance itself. The total value of assets on the exchange has swollen from around $80 billion in early January to $125 billion today, cementing its dominance even after a precarious period last year that culminated in the company paying an historic $4.3 billion fine to settle a case with US authorities.  Holders of BNB get trading-fee discounts on Binance and the token is also used to settle fees on BNB Smart Chain, a blockchain popular with crypto apps, including games and exchanges. BNB’s recent rally was foreshadowed in derivative market trading patterns from late May, with spot demand starting to pick up in June and buying consistently outpacing selling between June 2-5, according to Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert.  BNB trades on more than a dozen centralized exchanges, she said, “which differs from other exchange tokens that are almost exclusively traded on their affiliated platforms.” Binance still accounts for 85% of BNB volume globally, she added.  Binance had been accused of anti-money laundering and sanctions breaches that included failing to prevent Hamas, Al Qaeda and other militant groups from accessing the exchange. Zhao also agreed to pay a $50 million personal fine to settle the charges.   That is a drop in the bucket of Zhao’s net worth, which is estimated to stand at $38.5 billion — though the exact composition of the fortune is unknown. Zhao said in a 2021 interview with the Associated Press that the majority of his net worth was denominated in BNB, adding that he is a “decent sized shareholder in Binance.”  The man known as “CZ” is currently ranked as the 40th richest person in the world and has seen his net worth grow by $4.1 billion in 2024, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  While Zhao has never disclosed exactly how much BNB he owns, a 2017 whitepaper from BNB’s initial coin offering or ICO shows that 80 million tokens, today worth about $56 billion, were allocated to the founding team. The money raised through that ICO was used to launch the Binance exchange. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

14,"Craig Torres, Alex Tanzi, Bloomberg",It really might be different this time as the Fed puzzles over why high rates aren’t hitting the economy harder,https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/economic-outlook-fed-interest-rate-cut-fomc-meeting-financial-conditions-jerome-powell/,"While US interest rates at 23-year highs are causing pockets of pain, there’s nothing like the systemic problems that so often wrecked expansions in the past.",2024-06-09T16:21:10Z,"More than two years into the most aggressive Federal Reserve monetary tightening in four decades, the big surprise is that the world hasn’t fallen over. While US interest rates at 23-year highs are causing pockets of pain, there’s nothing like the systemic problems that so often wrecked expansions in the past. The Fed has held the policy rate at 5.25% to 5.5% for about a year and is expected to leave it unchanged at their two-day policy meeting this week. With Friday capping a run of steady economic data, investors have rolled back their expectations for rate cuts again, with only one — or maybe two — now expected by the end of the year.  Financial markets continue to digest what Chair Jerome Powell calls “restrictive” policy very well. The three US regional-bank failures of spring 2023 are most notable for how little they affected the economy and how quickly regulators were able to halt any contagion. Credit spreads remain tight, even among riskier bonds, and volatility is low.  In other words, something different is afoot this time, and it is catching the attention of the Federal Open Market Committee — the Fed panel that sets interest rates — and they are likely to take up the topic of easy financial conditions again this week. Here’s a look at a trio of unusual features that help explain why policy may have less bite: Privatization of Risk When tech stocks started falling in 2000, and subprime-mortgage related assets tumbled in 2007, it was visible to all. As fears of losses spread, fire-sales affected more and more assets, causing wider contagion — ultimately walloping the economy. What’s different today is that an increasing share of financing has come from private, not public, markets. Part of that is because of tighter regulation of publicly listed financial institutions. Pension funds, endowments, family offices, ultra-wealthy individuals and others are now more directly involved in lending through non-bank institutions than in the past. Nonbank lenders have been particularly active with mid-size firms, but they’re also involved with large corporations. There’s an oft-cited estimate of private credit totaling $1.7 trillion, but the lack of transparency means there’s no precise official tally. Because this lending is outside the visibility of public markets, problems that do develop have less chance of causing contagion. Missed interest-payments aren’t the subject of public news headlines, startling investors into herd-like behavior. Pension funds and insurance companies investing in private-credit funds are unlikely to ask for their money back tomorrow, reducing the risk of sudden stops in funding. The Caveat: Just because nothing in this area has produced a major blow-up yet doesn’t mean it won’t happen. A recent incident where a company shifted assets away from the reach of its lenders — part of a move to raise fresh financing — was an eye-opener for many on Wall Street. The IMF dedicated an entire chapter to private credit in their April financial stability report, and their assessment was mixed. The market’s size and growth mean “it may become macro-critical and amplify negative shocks,” the fund said. Pressure to do deals may lead to “lower underwriting standards.” Fabio Natalucci, a deputy director at the fund who oversees the report, said in an interview the private credit “eco-system is opaque and there are cross-border implications” now if the market goes through a convulsion. He worries about “layers of leverage” in the chain of investors, the funds and the companies they own. Government Debt Powers Growth The 1990s expansion ended in a crash after companies overextended, besotted with dreams of dot-com riches. In the 2000s, it was households that leveraged themselves, borrowing against expected gains in home equity. This time around, it’s the federal balance sheet that has played an unusually large role in the expansion. Government spending and investment contributed its highest share to GDP growth in 2023 in more than a decade, and of course it’s been financed with debt — which stood at 99% of GDP in fiscal year 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The chart below shows how dramatic the role reversal has been between households and the government: Government debt is referred to as a risk-free asset, because it’s safer than a household or company, since federal authorities have the power to tax. That means leveraging up the federal balance sheet for growth is inherently less dangerous than a surge in borrowing by the private sector. The Caveat:  Even governments can get into trouble, as the UK found out in 2022 when investors balked at plans for large, unfunded tax cuts. Rising interest rates are inflating US borrowing requirements, and warnings are cropping up that the US is on an unsustainable fiscal path. “There is almost surely a limit to how much debt outstanding there can be without the market driving yields up,” said Seth Carpenter, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley. Still, “if there is a tipping point, it is hard to believe we are at it right now.” The Fed Is Balancing Risks While the Fed has jacked up interest rates and is shrinking its bond portfolio, Powell and his colleagues have been particularly alert to downside risks. The central bank swooped in with emergency funding when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023, even as it was battling inflation. Powell and his lieutenants also have effectively taken further rate hikes off the table in the face of a still-strong economy and an inflation rate that remains above policymakers’ target. There’s even a stated bias to cut borrowing costs, in a nod toward trying to avoid acting too late and driving the economy into a recession. Fed communication is helping to limit volatility, and contributes to an easing in financial conditions generally. It appears strategic and intentional on the Fed’s part, suggesting Powell and his team are attuned to the potent threat of the so-called financial accelerator, where a rise in unemployment or a drop in earnings recoils into markets and amplifies negative shocks, risking a rapid descent into recession.  The Fed is trying to keep its “tight” monetary policy several notches below boil. This has given rise to a paradox. Fed officials say their policy is restrictive, but financial conditions are still easy. The Caveat: Fed policymakers cannot micro-manage all aspects of the financial system and the economy. There are real pockets of pain, and risks are concentrated in areas with less visibility. High interest rates for a long period do start to bite. “Behind the scenes, there is a lot more stress,” said Jason Callan, head of structured asset investing at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “The real linchpin is the labor market.” Much of the lending to low-income households is done by fintech firms beyond the oversight of regulators. The resiliency of the shadow banking system and consumers in a downturn without paycheck protection and stimulus checks remains to be seen. “The more inequality, the more financial instability,” Karen Petrou, co-founder of Federal Financial Analytics, a financial-sector analysis firm, said in a recent speech. “It’s more and more likely that even small amounts of macroeconomic or financial-system stress can quickly turn toxic.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

15,"Gautam Naik, Bloomberg","An extremely high-risk, high-reward corner of the bond market is seeing volume soar to record levels",https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/catastrophe-bond-market-record-volume-sales-hurricane-season-hedge-funds/,May alone witnessed the greatest volume of catastrophe bonds ever sold in a single month.,2024-06-09T15:47:32Z,"Issuance of catastrophe bonds just hit a record high, as the market braces for a rough hurricane season with the potential to do substantial damage. Sales of so-called cat bonds are 38% higher this year through May than over the same five-month period in 2023, which was already a record, according to Artemis, a compiler of data on insurance-linked securities. What’s more, the $4 billion issued in May alone represents the greatest volume of catastrophe bonds ever sold in a single month, Artemis said. The development looks set to reshape a market that last year supported the world’s best-performing hedge-fund strategy. Cat bonds, which allow insurers to transfer risk to the capital markets, can leave an investor with huge losses if catastrophe hits, and huge gains if it doesn’t. In 2023, cat bonds soared 20%, marking the best annual return in their almost three-decade history. Now, some veteran catastrophe-bond investors are looking for ways to cut their exposure as forecasts point to a particularly active hurricane season. Tenax Capital, an asset manager specialized in cat bonds, says greater scrutiny is needed when various forecasting agencies predict a more active hurricane season than usual, which is then reflected in daily portfolio decisions. Bonds in the firing line are those that are the most junior in an extreme weather event, said Toby Pughe, an analyst at London-based Tenax. The fund manager is now “even more strict in what we buy,” and is limiting investments to cat bonds that are triggered by statistically rare, large events, he said. Extreme weather events are among a number of parameters driving cat-bond issuance. Others include inflation and population density. All of these parameters have risen in recent years, leading insurers and reinsurers to rely more heavily on capital markets to cover potential losses.  Issuance of the bonds, including non-property and private transactions, reached an all-time high of more than $16 billion in 2023. The current value of outstanding cat bonds stands at $49 billion, Artemis estimates. Crucially, last year saw relatively few weather events that ended up triggering cat-bond payment clauses, leaving investors uniquely well off.  This year, the risks appear to be higher.  Thanks to near-record ocean temperatures and a shift to La Niña conditions, the US is expected to witness an extremely active hurricane season. Scientists at Colorado State University predict 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes, which is significantly higher than the historical average. They also warn of a higher probability that at least one major hurricane will make landfall this year. No one can accurately predict the size or path of a Caribbean tempest. But a series of accumulating risks — climate change, increased property exposure and inflation — has raised the financial impact of any storm season, and especially a more active one. “The US avoided a truly catastrophic hurricane season last year, but if forecasters are correct, we may not be so lucky in 2024,” said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, a unit of Moody’s. “With few signs of a slowdown in building in high-risk coastal areas, a major storm would have significant consequences.”  The outlook for Florida, where it’s become increasingly difficult to gain access to insurance, is now prompting cat-bond investors to treat some corners of the market with caution. “It wouldn’t surprise me if some investors say they’re not going to do Florida wind-storm cat bonds this year,” said James Eck, senior credit officer at Moody’s. Given the growing risk associated with holding the securities, investors are now demanding higher returns from issuers. Artemis notes that spreads on cat bonds soared 23% between March and the end of May. Meanwhile, insurers and reinsurers are continuing to farm out large chunks of their natural-disaster tail risk to the capital markets. Notable issuers include Citizens Property Insurance Corp., Florida’s property insurer of last resort, which recently finalized a $1.1 billion cat bond ahead of the hurricane period. The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association recently sponsored a $1.4 billion cat bond, its largest ever. Countries exposed to extreme weather risk also are tapping the cat-bond market. In April, the World Bank issued three cat bonds that provide $420 million of insurance coverage against storms and earthquakes for Mexico. A week later, the bank priced a catastrophe bond for $150 million for Jamaica against named storm events. The deals are part of the World Bank’s goal to increase the amount it has outstanding in cat bonds to $5 billion over the next few years. To be sure, a more active hurricane season doesn’t always mean more cat-bond losses.  “It all comes down to where a hurricane makes landfall,” said Charles Graham, insurance analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. A storm in a sparsely populated rural area could cause little damage, “but if something goes right through Miami, it’s going to be a different story,” he said. History shows “that larger losses don’t necessarily need to be precipitated by an active season,” according to a recent report by Man AHL, a unit of Man Group Plc, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager. That said, climate change is increasingly becoming a wild card for cat bond investors. Moody’s notes that 17 of the 19 costliest US hurricanes occurred in the past 20 years, even after adjusting for inflation. Added to this is a sharp rise in the frequency of billion-dollar events.  Costly storms threaten to “destabilize” the insurance market as some insurers flee high-risk areas like Florida and California, Moody’s said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

16,Jason Ma,IMF officialdelivers stark warning on AI's potential to turn an ordinary downturn into an severe economic crisis,https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/ai-risks-recession-economic-crisis-job-losses-financial-markets-supply-chains-imf/,"""I believe there is a real need to have parallel effort to make sure that we're also AI-proofing the global economy.""",2024-06-09T20:22:02Z,"The true disruptive effects of artificial intelligence on the economy and financial markets may not become apparent until there’s a downturn, which could spiral into a full-blown crisis unless the risks of AI are addressed, the IMF’s second-in-command warned recently. During a speech at an AI summit in Switzerland on May 30, IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said discussion about AI’s risks has largely focused on privacy, security, and misinformation. But much less talked about is the risk of AI amplifying the next recession. In a world of widespread AI adoption, the technology could convert an otherwise ordinary downturn into a much deeper economic crisis by disrupting labor markets, financial markets, and supply chains, she said. In normal economic times, companies historically have tended to invest in automation but still hold on to workers because they have the profits to do so. But when companies cut costs in a downturn, workers are laid off and replaced by automation, she explained. Gopinath pointed to IMF research that shows that in advanced economies, 30% of jobs are at high risk of AI substitution, compared with 20% in emerging markets, and 18% in low-income countries. “So we have a much broader scale of potential job losses that we could have,” she warned. “And again, the risks of long-term unemployment are quite severe.” The financial industry has long embraced automation and earlier forms of AI, such as algorithmic trading, and the sector is adopting newer AI technologies quickly today.  Gopinath noted that some AI trading is being replaced with more complex models that can learn on their own, and forecasts suggest that robo-advisors will control more than $2 trillion in assets by 2028, up from less than $1.5 trillion in 2023. While AI can improve market efficiency and inclusion, the risks of AI also are more likely to show up in a downturn, she added. That’s because new AI models would perform poorly in novel events that are different from what they were trained on. “And one thing we know is that no two recessions tend to be the same,” Gopinath said. In such a scenario, AI could spur a rapid, simultaneous move to safe assets, leading to falling prices on risk assets, she explained. The AI models would then detect the price declines, view that as affirmation of their earlier moves, then double down with more asset sales. And given the black-box nature of AI, such behavior could be difficult to control. “You could have fire sales and hurting behavior, which lead to even larger collapses in asset prices,” Gopinath said. As businesses adopt AI, they could let it play a larger role in deciding how much inventory to hold and how much to produce.  In normal economic times, that could boost efficiency and productivity. But AI models that were trained on “stale data” could produce major errors and lead to a cascade of supply-chain breakdowns, she said. After laying out the grim scenarios, Gopinath also provided recommendations to mitigate AI’s risks without curtailing the positive side of AI. One way is to ensure tax policies don’t inefficiently favor automation over workers, though she was careful to note she isn’t proposing a special tax on AI. Another way is to help workers with education and new skills as well as strengthening the social safety net with more generous jobless benefits. AI can also be part of the solution, such as in upskilling, targeting assistance better, and flagging early warnings in financial markets, she added. “I believe there is a real need to have parallel effort to make sure that we’re also AI-proofing the global economy,” Gopinath said. Her warning comes a year after she said we may not have much time to determine how to protect people from AI. “We need governments, we need institutions, and we need policymakers to move quickly on all fronts, in terms of regulation, but also in terms of preparing for probably substantial disruptions in labor markets,” she told the Financial Times. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

17,"Dana Hull, Jef Feeley, Bloomberg",Tesla investors may vote to give Elon Musk his $56 billion payday,https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/tesla-investors-vote-elon-musk-56-billion-payday-delaware-texas/,"The carmaker is banking on the Delaware Supreme Court, which will hear any appeal of McCormick’s ruling, taking a favorable view of investors re-ratifying the deal.",2024-06-10T11:44:31Z,"Even if Tesla Inc. shareholders vote later this week to ratify Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package, it’s unlikely to reverse a judge’s decision to nullify the 2018 compensation deal. That’s because the June 13 vote has more symbolic weight than legal power. Shareholder approval may help Tesla with an appeal or a rehearing in a new case, but it cannot overturn Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick’s January ruling, some legal scholars say.  “People think this is like a direct democracy — that if they vote yes to re-ratify Elon’s pay plan that it will fix what Chancellor McCormick did,” said Christina Sautter, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “But this is unprecedented.” Tesla called the vote as part of an unusual legal strategy. It’s seeking a redo to correct flaws in the process when shareholders approved Musk’s pay six years ago. In her ruling, McCormick pointed to director conflicts of interest and the company’s failure to properly disclose terms of his executive compensation plan. The carmaker is banking on the Delaware Supreme Court, which will hear any appeal of McCormick’s ruling, taking a favorable view of investors re-ratifying the deal. However, Tesla alluded in its proxy to the fact that it can’t guarantee a successful outcome. We “cannot predict with certainty how a vote to ratify Musk’s compensation would be treated under Delaware law in these novel circumstances,” the company wrote. Win or lose, Musk and Tesla cannot file an appeal until McCormick decides the legal fees in the case and issues a final judgment.  The more clear-cut and immediate impact of the vote on Musk’s pay is that it could strengthen or weaken the billionaire’s influence on the company. As of June 7, Tesla’s shares have fallen 29% this year amid growing competition for electric vehicles and slowing sales, and the vote is widely seen as a referendum on his leadership. Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services, two prominent proxy advisers, recommended that shareholders reject the pay package. ISS called it “outsized from the start” and said it has failed to meet some of the board’s stated objectives.  The award is seen as a way to maintain Musk’s focus on Tesla. Since 2018, he has sold Tesla shares to purchase X, formerly known as Twitter, and started xAI, so he now oversees six companies. He’s threatened to create more AI products outside of the carmaker if he can’t build his equity position in Tesla back up to 25%, from about 13% now. “What we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,” Board Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders last week. “Nor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.” Denholm has been courting large institutional investors in the days before the vote. Tesla has also dangled an exclusive factory tour with Musk as a potential prize for shareholders who can prove they’ve cast a ballot. Zohar Goshen, a Columbia Law School professor who specializes in corporate law issues, said launching a redo of the approval process for Musk’s pay is a proper way to rectify the flaws McCormick identified while still keeping the billionaire tied to Tesla. “The court’s finding that Tesla failed to properly approve the compensation package in 2018 doesn’t mean that Musk isn’t entitled to any compensation for the last six years of service,” Goshen wrote in an op-ed on Bloomberg Law. In 2018, 73% of Tesla shareholders who cast votes approved of Musk’s compensation plan. A “Vote Tesla” website the company created argues that shareholder democracy is at stake, saying: “We don’t believe one judge’s opinion should be able to overturn the decisions of millions of our stockholders.” Besides Musk’s compensation, shareholders will also vote on Tesla’s proposal to move its state of jurisdiction to Texas from Delaware. Tesla is already headquartered in Austin, and the company is arguing that it’s time to “make our business home our legal home.” Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware professor who founded the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, said that Texas courts may take a more favorable view on Musk’s compensation plan, but this vote is unlikely to sway Delaware judges. “I don’t agree at all with Tesla’s position that all the problems with the process of setting Mr. Musk’s pay can be wiped out with some kind of redo,” said Elson, who has filed a friend-of-the court brief in Musk’s pay case. “The only way the new vote matters is if Tesla directors decide to start the process over in a new state.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

18,Niamh Rowe,Nexus Laboratories raises $25 million from Pantera and Lightspeed to expand ‘zero-knowledge’ privacy tools,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/10/nexus-laboratories-raises-25-million-from-pantera-and-lightsped-to-expand-zero-knowledge-privacy-tools/,Nexus believes that the future of the internet will rely on proving the authenticity of datasets.,2024-06-10T12:00:00Z,"Nexus Laboratories is a virtual machine—software that emulates a physical computer—that wants to bolster trust in the internet. To do so, Nexus is betting on a species of cryptography called “zero-knowledge proofs,” or zk-proofs, which allow one party to prove to another that a piece of data is true, without conveying the underlying data. A simple analogy: a driver’s-license scanner that reveals someone is 21 without disclosing their name or address. Nexus believes zk-proofs are powerful and wants to make them accessible to any developer. Nexus took a step towards that goal on Monday, announcing it has raised $25 million in a Series A funding round. The round was co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Pantera Capital. Faction Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, and Blockchain Builders Fund also participated, bringing the company’s total funding to $27.2 million. Nexus envisions “a new future for the Internet where the integrity of computations and data are protected by proofs,” Daniel Marin, the company’s founder and CEO, said in a statement. Whether it’s artificial intelligence, cloud computing, or blockchains, pretty much any data set can be verified with zk-proofs. For now, however, Nexus is focused on rollups, the term for a Layer 2 blockchain built atop a main, layer 1 network, like Ethereum. Rollups are designed to help the underlying network scale by batching transactions together, and sending them to the main blockchain in a single transaction. “We expect that every decentralized network will see mission critical applications of zk-proofs,” said Lauren Stephanian, general partner with Pantera Capital. “We believe there will be thousands of rollups powered by zk-proofs in the very near future, all which will require proof generation.”  So, why should we care about verified computation? Marin told Fortune that in a world that’s increasingly on-chain and powered by AI, the use cases are far-reaching. This might mean proof of personhood, verifying tax software, or even authenticating crucial yet confidential data in the defense industry. “Anything that requires a lot of security, you need proof for it,” he says.  What, hypothetically, could be the largest dataset capable of being verified in the future? The Ethereum blockchain, he replied. This would mean proving all computation, from block zero to present, and compressing it into a single proof of maybe 100 bytes. “So, you could summarize all blockchain history into a single proof,” he explains, one that would get updated with every new block. But, he admits, we’re a long way off from that just yet. Investor Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner with Dragonfly, said in a statement that the firm first met Marin when he was a computer science and cryptography student at Stanford. “My firm led the seed investment in Nexus when Daniel graduated because we were impressed with his expertise and vision for how to improve performance and lower barriers to the use of zero-knowledge proofs,” Qureshi said.  Earlier this month, the company announced Nexus 1.0, the first major release of its zk-proof virtual machine. The software uses cryptography to “compact proof aggregation,” plus “optimize and parallelize verifiable computation” across a network of machines.  With the funding, Nexus intends to expand its product offerings, support early users, and maintain its engagement with the scientific community. The company is also eyeing collaboration with the financing. It’s launching both an open-source developer community, and the first phases of a new volunteer computing network, that it hopes will be able to break the record for the largest computation ever performed. It’s tricky to wrap one’s head around the possibility of what verifiability and truth mean in the computation, Marin admits, “but there’s a lot of possibilities here,” he insists. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

20,Ryan Hogg,Richard Branson unveils succession plan to give Virgin Atlantic to his kids,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/10/73-year-old-british-billionaire-sir-richard-branson-succession-virgin-atlantic-kids/,"Branson's daughter Holly is Virgin Atlantic's chief purpose and vision officer, while his son Sam is an informal advisor.",2024-06-10T12:59:04Z,"Sir Richard Branson may be well past retirement age at 73 years old, but the risk-loving entrepreneur shows no sign of slowing down. Even still, the Virgin Group CEO appears to be getting his affairs in order to ensure his crown jewel, Virgin Atlantic, stays in the family long after he’s gone. In an interview with the Times of London, 73-year-old Branson indicated he is one of several aging CEOs undergoing succession planning as part of the multitrillion-dollar wealth transfer set to occur over the next 30 years. As part of that transfer, Branson wants to hand the keys of his airline to his 42-year-old daughter Holly and his 39-year-old son Sam. “I plan to keep it in the family and they plan to keep it in the family,” Branson told The Times. Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by the Virgin Group, Branson’s parent organization, which controls its transport and media ventures. Delta Airlines owns the remaining shares. Holly is Virgin Group’s chief purpose and vision officer, while Sam is an informal advisor to his dad’s organization. Shai Weiss, a long-time Virgin Group employee, took over as Virgin Atlantic’s CEO in 2019. Over the years the question of who will take the reins of Branson’s multibillion-dollar corporate empire has slowly crept into his interview talking points. “We have serious discussions as a family about how the company can transform hopefully thousands of people’s lives in the years to come and hopefully in the centuries to come,” he told the BBC in 2023. Virgin Atlantic, which boasts a 41-jet fleet, brought in record revenues of £3.1 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2023, driving the airline to £352 million ($447 million) in profits.  The airline has overcome a few bumps before landing in a more comfortable financial spot, including needing a bailout in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as casting a new eye over his legacy, Branson has become more circumspect about his wealth as he edges closer to retirement.  The billionaire recently questioned the use of wealth as a barometer of success. Speaking to CNBC Make It in May, the septuagenarian said “Maybe in America, ‘billionaire’ is a sign of success, but that rankles me,” adding it would be sad if people were living life for the paycheck. “Paying the bills at the end of the year is important, but what entrepreneurs are doing all over the world today—and the only reason they’re succeeding—is that they’re making a difference in other people’s lives,” Branson said. “And that’s all that really matters.” However, Branson will surely have noticed a sharp decline to his net worth in recent years, particularly if it means the size of the pot he leaves for his offspring is shrinking. According to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, Branson’s net worth last year fell back to levels last seen in 2000, dipping to £2.4 billion ($3 billion). Some of Branson’s companies, including Virgin Galactic, have plummeted in value, while companies backed by Branson that went public via a SPAC have also declined in worth. In all, his net worth has tumbled by more than half since 2021. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

21,"Zen Soo, The Associated Press",China exports in May grew at the fastest rate in more than a year despite U.S. trade tensions,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/07/china-exports-may-grew-fastest-rate-year-us-trade-tensions-imports-fell-short/,"Exports jumped 7.6% in May from the same month last year to $302.35 billion, rising at the fastest pace since April 2023. Imports rose by 1.8% to $219.73 billion, missing estimates of about 4% growth.",2024-06-07T08:31:16Z,"China’s exports in May grew at their fastest pace in more than a year despite trade tensions, though imports fell short of analyst expectations, according to customs data released Friday. Exports jumped 7.6% in May from the same month last year to $302.35 billion, rising at the fastest pace since April 2023. Imports rose by 1.8% to $219.73 billion, missing estimates of about 4% growth. The uptick in exports is also partly due to a lower base in the same period last year, when exports declined 7.5%. In comparison, exports grew by 1.5% in April compared to the same period last year while April imports rose by 8.4%. The strong exports caused China’s trade surplus to widen to $82.62 billion, up from April’s $72.35 billion. The growth in exports comes as China faces escalated trade tensions with the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. is ramping up tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars while Europe is considering levying similar tariffs. “Foreign tariffs are unlikely to immediately threaten exports; if anything, they may boost exports at the margin as firms speed up shipments to front-run the duties.” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics in a note. Huang also said that exports would be supported by a weaker real effective exchange rate. “Import volumes were little changed last month, but they will probably rise soon, with increased government spending supporting the import-intensive construction sector,” she said. Factory activity in China slowed more than expected in May, according to an official survey released last week. The manufacturing purchasing managers index from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing fell to 49.5 from 50.4 in April on a scale up to 100 where 50 marks the break between expansion and contraction. China has struggled to bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic, as it grapples with weaker demand globally after the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks raised interest rates to counter inflation. A slump in China’s property sector also is weighing on growth. China has set a target of around 5% for economic growth this year, an ambition that will require more policy support, economists say. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

22,"Abdulrahman Zeyad, The Associated Press",People in Iraq are so angry at the U.S. over Gaza that they're attacking KFC stores and other American brands,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/kfc-attacks-iraq/,"The recent attacks — apparently orchestrated by supporters of Iran-backed, anti-American militias in Iraq — reflect surging anger against the United States, Israel’s top ally, over the war in Gaza.",2024-06-07T08:28:22Z,"A dozen masked men jump out of two SUVs and a white pickup and storm a KFC in Baghdad, smashing everything in sight before fleeing the scene. A few days earlier, similar violence played out at Lee’s Famous Recipe Chicken and Chili House — all American brands popular in the Iraqi capital. Though no one was seriously hurt, the recent attacks — apparently orchestrated by supporters of Iran-backed, anti-American militias in Iraq — reflect surging anger against the United States, Israel’s top ally, over the war in Gaza. Iraqi governments have for years walked a delicate line between Washington and Tehran, but the eight-month war in Gaza has critically upped the stakes. The conflict erupted after the militant Hamas group stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking 250 hostage. Israel’s subsequent offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians in the territory, according to the Health Ministry there. Days after the war broke out, a coalition of Iran-backed militias dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq launched dozens of attacks on bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and eastern Syria. Those attacks stopped in February — but only after a series of retaliatory U.S. strikes following a drone hit on a base in Jordan that killed three American soldiers. The attacks on U.S.-linked businesses and brands in Iraq in late May and earlier this week represent a change in tactics intended to maximize anti-U.S. sentiment over Washington’s support for Israel. The KFC attack unfolded like a robbery — except the attackers weren’t after the money. Security camera footage shows the masked men bursting into the fast food restaurant as horrified workers and customers escape through a back exit. The men then proceed to smash windows and LED screens, break chairs, tables, kitchen appliances — and whatever else they could find. Minutes later, security forces arrive at the scene and fire warning shots as perpetrators run back into their cars and speed away. In other incidents, a sound bomb was hurled outside the Caterpillar company store, rattling the neighborhood and leaving a small pothole in the street. Some of the displays of anti-U.S. sentiment have been less volatile. Protesters carrying Palestinian and Iraqi flags last week marched up to the PepsiCo offices in Baghdad, chanting “No to agents” and “No to Israel.” Another protest took place outside the offices of Procter & Gamble. Iraqi forces armed with assault rifles and backed by armored vehicles with mounted machine guns now guard the targeted premises and franchises. Two officials from Iran-backed militias in Iraq confirmed to The Associated Press that the attackers were their supporters, and that their goal is to promote a boycott of American brands and deter their presence in the country. It’s also an attempt to bolster the militias’ image, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with their groups’ regulations. Abu Ali al-Askari, spokesperson for the powerful Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, on Monday urged supporters to get rid of Israel’s “espionage affiliates covered in civilian garb” — a reference to businesses and organizations perceived as linked to the U.S. and Israel. Essa Ahmad, who organized over 30 protests in support of Gaza, said during a recent Baghdad rally that he and other youth activists want Iraqis to boycott products “that support Israel,” though he says they don’t condone violence. Firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr — a rival of the Iran-backed factions who, though retired from politics, is still widely popular among many Iraqi Shiites — has called for Iraq to expel the U.S. ambassador. Political analyst Ihsan al-Shammari sees the targeting of U.S. and Western brands as playing into the decades-old rivalry between Tehran and Washington. “These attacks have political goals,” he said. They send a message “that any investment or presence of Western companies in Iraq cannot survive.” Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House in London, says Iraq has been a “playground” for both Washington and Tehran, leaving Baghdad’s governments with little sovereignty and agency. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who came to power with the backing of a pro-Iran coalition, has tried to appease his anti-U.S. allies without stoking tensions with Washington or jeopardizing foreign investments in Iraq. Iraq and the U.S. in recent months began formal talks to draw down some 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Iraq under an agreement with Baghdad, mainly to counter the militant Islamic State group. “The prime minister of Iraq … has pushed this idea that Iraq is out of war and is focusing on reinitiating the relationship with the U.S. and looking at the relationship with Iran and pushing for Iraq’s sovereignty,” Mansour told the AP. “Of course, the war on Gaza has impacted this.” The Interior Ministry said it arrested some suspects in the rioting and was searching for others. But the two militia figures claimed the government doesn’t dare go after the rioters despite being aware of who they are, fearing an escalation. They warned of more attacks on U.S. interests, should the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq stall further. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Alina Romanowski condemned the targeting of American and international franchises in a post on the social media platform X, saying they could impact foreign investment in Iraq’s economy. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the attacks on “what are essentially franchises of U.S. companies harm Iraqi workers, Iraqi patrons, sometimes Iraqi capital that is being employed there.” “So they are attacks eventually against the Iraqi people,” Miller said. “We think the Iraqi government ought to take appropriate measures to respond to those attacks and hold people accountable.” Iraq’s security spokesperson Maj. Gen. Tahseen al-Khafaji told the AP that the rioters will be pursued — as will anyone who threatens the country’s security and economic well-being. “We are making significant efforts to safeguard investments and the progress achieved by the current government,” al-Khafaji said. “It is essential to protect these accomplishments and create a safe environment for investors.” Still, al-Askari warned security officials not to stand in the way of efforts to “take out” American interests in Iraq. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

23,"Lea Skene, Melina Walling, The Associated Press",Michigan tornado and Ohio and Maryland storms kill toddler and injure at least 13,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/michigan-tornado-ohio-maryland-storms-kill-toddler-injure-13/,It has been a grim spring for tornadoes in the U.S. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes for that month on record in the country.,2024-06-07T08:22:52Z,"A tornado that ripped through suburban Detroit earlier this week downed trees that smashed through the roof of Abby Sata’s family home, sending water gushing below. Though they now have a giant crane taking trees off the house, they were lucky no one was hurt. The tornado that damaged Sata’s home in Livonia, Michigan, tore through several neighborhoods and felled a tree that killed a toddler on Wednesday. It developed so quickly that there was no advance notice from the National Weather Service or others that would have normally led to the activation of warning sirens. Sata, 21, said she got a storm warning on her phone but no indication that a tornado was lurking. “I was in shock,” she said. “It would have been very helpful. Even three seconds before the tornado would have given me a heads-up.” The twister in Livonia “spun up almost as quickly as it started to dissipate,” said Jaclyn Anderson, a meteorologist with the Detroit office of the National Weather Service. The tornado, which was of a type known for being weak and brief, traveled a path of about 5 miles (8 kilometers). More powerful tornadoes generated from intense storms can stay on the ground for 30, 40 or even 100 miles and are much easier to anticipate and issue warnings for, she said. While tornado-forecasting equipment has improved “tenfold” over the past few decades, relying on a combination of weather radar and local observations, Anderson said short-lived tornadoes can still be “quite challenging when it comes to getting warnings out.” Forecasters create tornado outlooks every day, factoring in different weather elements, said Victor Gensini, an associate professor at Northern Illinois University who studies tornadoes and extreme weather. But sometimes those conditions happen on a small scale — for instance, a sudden breeze coming off a lake. It has been a grim spring for tornadoes in the U.S. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes for that month on record in the country. In suburban Maryland, a line of storms produced unusually strong tornadoes that felled trees, damaged buildings and downed power lines Wednesday night. But while Gensini did say that the national numbers are a little above average at the moment, it’s too early to make definitive statements about the tornado year as a whole. He said the U.S. can get as many as 1,500 tornadoes a year, and this time of year is statistically the most likely for tornado activity in the U.S.; many of them just aren’t in high-profile places or aren’t captured in clear images. “The tornadoes that have occurred this year have been very visible,” he said. Gensini, who also studies how climate change is affecting tornado activity, said that the science of attributing twister-spawning storms to climate change is still in its infancy, and it can be hard to connect the dots to one individual tornado. But looking at broader-scale trends, his team has found an increasing likelihood of tornadoes developing in regions farther south and east in the U.S. than in the past. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of several other states on Wednesday night, including Ohio, New Jersey and Delaware. In Ohio, a suspected tornado ripped away a gas station canopy and heavily damaged a restaurant and a discount store early Thursday in the eastern village of Frazeysburg. Eight people suffered minor injuries, mostly from flying debris, said Jeff Jadwin, the emergency management director in Muskingum County. While tornadoes are not unheard of in Maryland, they are relatively rare — especially outbreaks of the volume seen Wednesday night. At least five people were injured and the weather service issued 22 tornado warnings Wednesday, the fourth-most issued in a single day by the office that covers much of Maryland, the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and the eastern West Virginia panhandle, according to Kevin Rodriguez, lead meteorologist at the weather service office in Sterling, Virginia. “It was a very busy night,” said National Weather Service Hydrologist Jeremy Geiger. “It’s one of those things, all the right ingredients that come together at the right time. So that’s always the question.” Geiger said it wasn’t a super high-energy storm system, but the wind shear and other factors gave it a boost and created the rotation that allows tornadoes to form. He said the system was especially challenging because forecasters were issuing flash flood warnings and tornado warnings simultaneously, with some residents being advised to seek high ground and others sheltering in the basement. In Gaithersburg, Maryland, George Mhaano told WJLA-TV that a crane might be needed to lift a tree off his home, so he would probably stay at a hotel. When the tornado hit, Mhanno said he heard loud thuds and banging on the window, so he hid in a bathtub. Later, firefighters came knocking and told him to get out, which he did. “Thank God, I wasn’t hurt. And thank God, everyone at my house was at church,” Mhaano told WJLA-TV. “This is just material. It can be replaced or fixed. No one got hurt, so that’s all that matters.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Over the course of the rambling, 50-minute call, Gill expounded on his faith in GameStop’s corporate strategy and its new CEO, Ryan Cohen, and confirmed that screenshots posted to his Reddit account earlier this week displaying a brokerage account with over 5 million GameStop call options were indeed his. “[GameStop] becomes a bet on the veterans, you know—in particular, of course, Ryan Cohen,” Gill said. “I think we’ve seen enough from him to think he’s got a good head on his shoulders.” Gill was instrumental in GameStop’s initial surge in January 2021, when his Reddit posts and livestreams helped generate enough interest from memestock traders to push the ailing video-game retailer’s stock price up well over 1,000%. After disappearing for three years, Gill’s Twitter account began posting cryptic images and movie stills earlier this month, igniting another rally that more than doubled GameStop’s share price at its peak. When Gill announced that he would be appearing on a livestream this morning, GameStop’s share price jumped nearly 30%—making Gill a billionaire on paper based on the value of his call options. However, the stock retreated by 25% by the time the stream began, and fell a further 12% during the stream, erasing his prior gains. Gill commented on reports that brokerage platform E*Trade was considering banning him from the platform, using his browser’s HTML function to remove the E*Trade logo from his account’s dashboard.  “I’ve seen those headlines, E*Trade,” Gill said. “I’m checking in every day. I’ll log in. I’m like, my position is still there. Are they still there? Let me check it. They’re still there.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

25,Paolo Confino,"Nvidia's stock split is largely 'cosmetic,' and mammoth gains will keep rolling in, tech investor says",https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/nvidia-stock-split-10-1-nvda-outlook-ai-chips-sales/,"Between the AI-driven stock market rally and Nvidia’s strong fundamentals, it’s unlikely the 10-for-1 stock split will harm its share price.",2024-06-07T21:27:40Z,"Shares of the hottest stock on the S&P 500 increased tenfold on Friday.  After the market’s close, Nvidia’s 10-for-one stock split, which was announced in May during the company’s most recent earnings call, went into effect. But it will do little to change the company’s $3 trillion valuation or its underlying fundamentals, which so far, have investors licking their chops.  “You and I know that a stock split is just cosmetic, at least it is for existing shareholders,” says Paul Meeks, a veteran tech investor and business school professor at military college the Citadel. “With their investor relations routine, Nvidia is well aware they have to keep on throwing a few bones out there” to investors. Few other companies have embodied the new corporate hierarchy pecking order ushered in by the proliferation of AI quite like Nvidia has. The company’s stock rose 3,174% over the last five years and 218% in just the last year. During its epic run, Nvidia’s market cap soared past the likes of Amazon and Alphabet. Before the 10-for-one split, the stock was at a stratospheric $1,209.  That price was likely too high for most investors, certainly the retail investors the split was meant to attract, according to Humayun Sheikh, CEO of startup Fetch.ai, which provides developer tools specifically for AI. “The stock split enhances Nvidia’s appeal by making shares more affordable, thus broadening its investor base,” he said.  Sheikh, too, sees the move as at least partially about investors’ perceptions, saying it was likely “influenced by optics” and could accelerate market cap gains.  Nvidia’s position as the firm that has cornered the market on providing AI developers all the chips and computing power they need isn’t changing because of the stock split. In the first quarter, Nvidia’s sales rose 262% annually to $26 billion, outperforming Wall Street’s already lofty expectations.  Nvidia’s stock rally also serves as a hint at what the AI boom could still have in store.  “Nvidia’s change in price over the last year is telling us something about the market, namely, that perhaps AI is the new general purpose technology, like the internet or electricity, which will have massive productivity implications across the economy, and therefore AI companies will benefit greatly,” said NYU business school professor Vasant Dhar.  Still, investors are considering a few scenarios in which things might go south for them after the stock split, even as they admit the odds are slim. For Meeks, the only thing that could halt Nvidia’s march to the top is an economy-wide slowdown, which he considers unlikely because he expects the U.S. will avoid a recession and that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in early 2025. In fact, he’s already thinking about Nvidia’s performance should the economy improve.  “It’d be hard for these stocks to lose their gains if all of a sudden we go from wind in our face with high rates to wind at our back with low rates,” Meeks said.  Meanwhile, Sheikh said that the retail investors the split was meant to attract are another possible, but unlikely, concern. Individually, retail investors may hold small amounts of Nvidia stock. But collectively, they can make up a significant portion of shares. So any shocks to the system or unexpected changes in their views on the company can still have a notable effect. One need look no further than GameStop to understand the outsize influence retail investors can have on the market.  Reducing the stock to one-tenth of its price could be a double-edged sword. “This approach might appeal to Robinhood-type investors or meme-stock enthusiasts,” Sheikh added. “However, if the narrative turns against Nvidia and speculative traders start selling off, it could impact the price negatively.”  But even if that unwelcome scenario were to happen, it wouldn’t change all the market trends propping up the chipmaker.  “Nvidia already had a huge run-up in price, so any tailwind from a stock split will be miniscule in comparison to the ‘fundamental’ reasons for its performance,” Dhar said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

26,John Attanasio,Fear and loathing in Los Angeles over AI. But it doesn’t have to be this way,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/fear-and-loathing-in-los-angeles-ai-hollywood-entertainment-tech/,"“Stay alive till ‘25” is a thing in Hollywood—but AI can save the film industry, not destroy it with robots.",2024-06-07T22:27:56Z,"John Attanasio is the CEO of Toonstar. I can’t recall the exact moment. It might have been during an AI event that I attended last summer where a top union exec proclaimed that she “prefers candles to electricity” in front of a cheering crowd…or it might have been last fall, post-writer’s strike resolution, when I warned that the challenges for Hollywood were not over and someone on X (formerly Twitter) thoughtfully responded with “Die AI Scum.” Or perhaps it was earlier this year when the audience at a SXSW panel with OpenAI loudly and frequently booed speakers who professed any benefit of AI. But I do know that at some point during that sequence of events, I realized the backlash to talk of AI in Hollywood was no ordinary fear of a new technology. And in this case, it’s a fear that will only prolong the troubles plaguing Hollywood if it persists. Fear of new technology, and the changes that come with it, is certainly not new. We can trace it all the way back to The Luddites smashing looms in England during the industrial revolution. But the existential crisis currently facing the entertainment industry has been in the making for decades and it has nothing to do with AI. Distribution fragmentation driven by the rise of internet video and social media platforms has disrupted the gatekeeper era and the monopoly on access to audiences of the mega-network and cable days. Add to that, there’s now a business model imbalance, courtesy of the streaming wars, which drove up the cost of production and marketing so high that basic economic rules (i.e. profits) were forgotten. The result? Ongoing legacy industry consolidation and the seemingly unending layoffs that have haunted the studios for more than a decade. Almost any writer, actor, or agent will tell you about how hard it’s become to get anything sold, let alone made. “Stay alive till ‘25” is a thing, which is apparent in the testimonials featured in this recent LinkedIn post from many skilled behind-the-camera professionals who haven’t worked in months, and are on the cusp of selling their homes to survive.  Last but not least, younger generations have new tastes and habits that have been born from legacy alternatives such as YouTube and TikTok which have significantly challenged the media industrial complex. A recent Harris Poll reported that nearly three-fourths of Gen Zers and millennials prefer original content over franchises and want more content from small, independent creators. So why not lean into this trend and give younger audiences what they want?   Hollywood should be embracing these desires, but it’s not. Instead, it’s stuck in prequel-sequel-reboot purgatory and focused on brute force big-name, big-budget blockbusters in the hopes of combating fragmenting distribution and changing business models. Cord Jefferson made an impassioned plea at the Oscars this year for studios to make 20 $10 million movies or 50 $4 million movies instead of a single $200 million movie because there are too many great storytellers out there who can’t get their projects made. And guess what, with that many great storytellers and with audiences who want their stories, it doesn’t have to be that way.  And this is absolutely where AI can enter the picture as part of the solution. AI-powered tools can help democratize production capabilities previously only available to the big studios and put this superpower in the hands of these talented independent creators who have been left behind by the legacy system. AI can help deliver cost-effective, studio-quality productions which in turn will unlock opportunities for new and diverse storytellers, create new job opportunities, and satisfy the demand from millennial, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha audiences. And these are job opportunities and original projects that are just not in the cards from legacy Hollywood. The proponents of AI in Hollywood have learned to develop thick skin around this issue. We’ll take the insults on X because believe it or not, we’re lobbying to save the industry, not destroy it with robots. And in fact, it’s not the robots we should be worried about. As in the case of all human history, in the words of historian Melvin Kranzberg, “Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral.” It’s the bad actors who use tech to do harm that we need to worry about.   It’s true that with each new technological innovation, jobs are indeed lost while new efficiencies are reaped, and new types of jobs are created. AI is no different. It will eliminate jobs. But to talk of a smart approach to using AI in Hollywood is to absorb all the fear and anger of a community of creatives that’s borne the fallout of an industry that lost its way long before AI. And if we let fear take over, we’re going to lose the chance to manage and control AI in a way that can help get our industry back on its feet. Maybe the words of Matthew McConaughey’s indelible Rust Cohle character put it best right after his own existential reckoning, “It’s just one story. The oldest. Light versus dark.” But not “light vs. dark” as in tech vs. humans, but “light vs. dark” as in humans doing good vs. humans doing harm. And maybe this is the moment when we find out what kind of humans we are.

27,Beth Greenfield,"Nicotine patches, like Zyn, are used by 400,000 teens. Here's why some experts say 'it's reasonable to be concerned'",https://fortune.com/well/article/zyn-nicotine-pouches-teens-health-risks/,"Health risks of nicotine include a moderately elevated risk of increased blood pressure, heart rate, and a narrowing of the arteries.",2024-06-08T00:11:00Z,"Hunter “Ratch” Ratchford is an Alabama college student with 42,000 followers on TikTok. That’s where he posts, pretty much exclusively, about Zyn, a brand of flavored oral nicotine pouches that come in bright round cans and flavors like cool mint, citrus, and cinnamon. Three years ago, says Ratch, one of his fraternity buddies introduced him to the product. “He said it helped him focus when he was having back-to-back classes, so I tried it,” he says, noting that it helped him too and that he liked the buzz. “I’ve been hooked ever since.” Today, he says, he goes through a can to a can and a half a day—about 25 pouches total—placing a pouch between his gum and his lip or cheek around every 15 minutes to deliver the maximum-available-in-the-U.S. 6 mg of tobacco-free nicotine (compared to a cigarette’s 10-12 mg) directly to his bloodstream through the lining of his mouth. His frequent posts—sponsored by Snus Town, an online UK-based shop that sends him 10 cans a week to sample—range from dreaming up new Zyn flavors to simply declaring his love for the little white pouches. And while Zyn’s website says its product is for adults 21 and over who currently use nicotine, Ratch, 22, says that he’d never smoked or vaped (and still hasn’t) when he started using as a teen. “Zyn is the only type of nicotine I’ve ever used,” he says. Now he’s just one of the estimated 2.1% of adults (5.2 million people) using smokeless tobacco products in the U.S., according to latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (which do not break out nicotine pouches specifically). Ratch is also not the only Zyn user to have started as a teen. According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey of 2023, an estimated 1.5% of high school and middle school students (more than half of them boys), representing 400,000 adolescents, use nicotine pouches—around the same percentage (1.6%) who smoke cigarettes, but much less than those who vape (7.7%). Those numbers have remained unchanged in recent years, noted an April press release from the FDA regarding underage sales of nicotine pouches by retailers. Still, said Brian King, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, “FDA remains concerned about any tobacco product that may be appealing to youth and we will continue to closely monitor youth use of these products.” Thanks to users of all ages, Zyn and other oral nicotine products (with other brands including Velo, On! and Rogue) comprise a market expected to bring in $2 billion of U.S. revenue this year—despite most brands, Zyn included, having none of its products authorized for sale in the U.S. by the FDA. That’s because they hit the market in 2014, before the FDA had regulations for new tobacco and nicotine products in place, and are now being required to retroactively prove they have enough public-health benefit to remain available. Those decisions are now pending. Sales, meanwhile, are skyrocketing, seeing a six-fold spike between 2019 and 2022. And Zyn maker Swedish Match’s parent company, Philip Morris International, reported a nearly 80% rise in sales during the first quarter of 2024 over the same period last year, leading to a current shortage in some markets. Many blame youth usage on the preponderance of Zyn content on social media—where fans, or “Zynfluencers,” can be found trying new flavors for the first time or building sculptures from the hundreds of empty cans they’ve collected, using slang terms like “lip pillow” or “upper decky” because of where the pouches are placed in the mouth. It’s all fueled some fears that Zyn could be the next Juul in terms of youth appeal and the implications for public health—something Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) seized on recently, as he called on regulators to investigate Zyn because of its appeal to teens. That prompted pushback from some prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson—who had already gone viral in a Zyn-themed video posted to Instagram by prankster-influencers the Nelk Boys. In response to Schumer, he declared, “Zyn is not a sin.” A spokesperson for Philip Morris International provided the following statement to Fortune: “For the nearly 30 million Americans who smoke, Swedish Match is committed to developing products such as ZYN that are scientifically substantiated as a better alternative to continued smoking. Swedish Match goes beyond legal requirements to ensure our marketing is directed toward legal age nicotine users above the age of 21. We do not use social media influencers, refuse requests for such partnerships, age-gate our digital channels, and only use adult-oriented flavors. We’ve also joined We Card’s Advisory Council, a nonprofit serving retailers of age-restricted products, to work with them to educate and train retail frontline employees on the need to card for nicotine pouches, and ensure pouches are included in 21+ signage across the vast majority of brick and mortar shops. Manufacturers, regulators, retailers and social media platforms must work together to ensure these products are only used by people 21+, and we believe we’re doing our part to achieve that objective.” Regardless, it’s important for parents to be aware of Zyn and its risks, says Rees, adding, “It’s reasonable to be concerned anytime a child is using an addictive substance or product.” Here’s what else parents need to know. “Addiction in itself is considered a health problem,” says Rees, “and nicotine use disorder has implications for young people’s social and emotional development.” In part, he says, “It narrows the behavioral repertoire, so rather than choosing activities that might be beneficial or that might enhance engagement with other people and the world in positive ways, they tend to make much narrower choices that substance use disorder imposes.” Instead of hanging out with friends, for example, teens who are addicted “will hang out alone and use nicotine.” Other health risks of nicotine include a moderately elevated risk of increased blood pressure, heart rate, flow of blood to the heart, and a narrowing of the arteries, according to the American Heart Association. But the risk of cardiovascular disease, Rees stresses, is much less than with smoking. Most research points to cigarette smoke, not nicotine, as the cause of cancer, although some research suggests that nicotine may lead to a type of DNA damage that could elevate the risk of cancer.  Further, a recent small study of pouch users found self-reported side effects including mouth lesions, upset stomach, and sore throat.  On the positive side, there is “some evidence” to support it can help with focus, but “could have a deterioration in focus if you are in withdrawal,” notes Lynn Kozlowski, a longtime tobacco researcher and professor emeritus at the University of Buffalo’s School of Public Health and Health Professions. What most concerns Kozlowski is a recent study from Truth Initiative, an educational nonprofit that discourages tobacco and nicotine use. It found that most young people aged 15 to 24 who use oral nicotine pouches also smoke cigarettes (73%) and that nearly half (49%) also vape. Those findings, he believes, are why he feels parents needn’t get too distracted by Zyn. “Smoking is the much more important thing to be discouraging,” he says. “What I am concerned about is if you’ve got clientele among the youth who are largely experimenting with smoking and pouches you don’t want any messaging to make people more afraid of pouches than cigarettes.”  He pointed to a recent survey in which most smokers wrongly believe that vaping is equally or more harmful than cigarettes. “Oh my god, is that wrong,” he says. “The major cancer causing ingredients are things that come in a combustive product … Pouches are very much in the toxicological ballpark as nicotine lozenges and gum—they don’t get into your lungs. And most of what kills people is getting smoke in the lungs.” By no means is a nicotine patch a “health food,” Kozlowski adds. But if you’ve got a kid who is using a pouch, “look hard and fast to see if they’re also smoking. If there’s just a pouch and no smoking, that’s progress.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

28,Brad Lander,NYC comptroller: Food delivery apps are blaming minimum pay for inflation. It's baloney,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/nyc-comptroller-food-delivery-apps-minimum-pay-inflation-baloney-labor-politics-tech/,"Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub together average about 2.6 million deliveries a week in New York, both before and after the rate increase.",2024-06-07T13:17:19Z,"Brad Lander is the New York City Comptroller. When New Yorkers order late-night Chinese food or a salad for lunch on their delivery apps, the meal appears just a few minutes later. But it isn’t magic, technology, or a billion-dollar app company that brings it. It’s a human being. Unfortunately, despite riding through rain, snow, heat, and NYC traffic, these delivery workers, or deliveristas, are often treated as barely human by the companies that rely on them. Some restaurants deny them the use of the bathroom during long shifts. The apps’ payment algorithms pressure them to deliver meals on opposite ends of Manhattan in mere minutes—so the fatality rate has become one of the highest for any job here.  And until recently, delivery workers earned less than the minimum wage—sometimes as low as $6 per hour. So last year, New York City became the first place in the country to do something about it. I was proud to be the City Council sponsor of the minimum pay bill, which raised the minimum pay floor for deliveristas to $17.96 an hour. No one gets rich at that rate, just above New York’s minimum wage; but at least these hard workers can be assured a bare minimum. Unfortunately, Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub are doing everything in their power to undermine even that. They threw up losing lawsuits and lobbied City Hall relentlessly. Next, they made it more confusing for customers to tip. That’s no surprise. They did the same back in 2018 when we passed a law—which I also sponsored in the City Council—guaranteeing minimum pay for Uber and Lyft drivers. The companies assailed the law through lobbying, public relations campaigns, and lawsuits. They sent push notifications to drivers and customers to spread falsehoods—including the threat that they would shut down. Just like they are doing now in Minneapolis, where the City Council recently passed a similar bill. But the law works. Six years later, Uber and Lyft are going strong in NYC. As of March 2024, New Yorkers and tourists took 686,475 Uber and Lyft trips per day—an all-time high since the pandemic. We estimate that app companies are making more than a million dollars a day here. The difference for drivers has been huge. An analysis found: “Drivers in New York have made more per hour and for each trip on average, people haven’t been significantly discouraged from riding with Uber or Lyft, and even the companies have most likely done better.” Similarly, there’s no evidence that the minimum wage for delivery workers is negatively affecting customers. Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub together average about 2.6 million deliveries a week, both before and after the rate increase. So for their next argument, the apps are blaming these marginal wage increases for inflation. You might have thought it was supply chain disruption, pandemic stimulus, or greedflation. But no, according to some, it’s your deliverista or Uber driver’s fault for demanding to be treated like a human being. It’s a classic argument by some out-of-touch billionaires to blame the minimum wage for inflation. But it’s baloney.  As New York City comptroller, I analyze the city’s economic landscape, and here’s what the data says: a higher minimum wage for our lowest-paid workers raises many boats. That’s what happened when New York phased the minimum wage up to $15 an hour between 2013 and 2019. Employment in sectors with a high percentage of minimum wage workers—like fast food—grew by 31% in New York City, much faster than the 20% in the average of 12 cities across the nation that did not raise their minimum wage at that time. Minimum wage household incomes grew by 50%, and the poverty rate among those households declined by 7%. As employment and incomes rose, so did the opening of new restaurants and hotels. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 gave hundreds of thousands of low-wage New Yorkers some economic security. Our 2018 law did the same for Uber drivers. And our new law is doing the same for deliveristas who were a vital lifeline during the pandemic and continue to provide an essential service. It’s no surprise that the app companies would peddle ridiculous agreements blaming their own low-wage workers for inflation. They are out to extract every penny they can from the delivery workers whose labor they rely on to pad their bottom line. That’s the gig business model. And they’re coming for more and more of us. But the data is clear: Enabling low-wage workers to earn enough to get by is good for the economy. Don’t buy the divide-and-conquer nonsense that argues otherwise.     The workers who put food on our tables should be able to put food on theirs.

29,Chris Morris,'Full House' home is up for sale for $6.5 million,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/full-house-home-for-sale-6-5-million-price/,It's the third time it's been on the market in 10 years.,2024-06-07T15:22:04Z,"Been dreaming of owning the Tanner house from Full House since Michelle was a toddler? You got it, dude—if you’ve got $6.5 million to spend. The iconic Victorian that was shown in exterior shots of the ABC show (and its Netflix sequel), located at 1709 Broderick Street in San Francisco, went on the market this week. It was last sold in 2020 for $5.35 million. The house measures about 3,700 square feet on the inside and comes with four bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms, a gas fireplace, a two-car garage, and an English garden. There’s a walk-in pantry in the chef’s kitchen, which is equipped with a wine fridge and Viking appliances. And the lower floor houses a wet bar. Throughout that English garden are concrete stones that feature the handprints and signatures of the Full House cast. Whoever buys the house will have the option to buy those as well, though the price was not mentioned. The home was built in 1900 originally and renovated most recently by architect Richard Landry, AIA, and the Landry Design Group. It was previously owned by Full House creator Jeff Franklin. “It’s great to have the house in our Full House family and be able to preserve it for the fans,” he told the Hollywood Reporter at the time. “Seriously, I love owning this house.” Full House ran on ABC from 1987 through 1995. The sequel, Fuller House, aired five seasons on Netflix. While the home’s exterior is iconic, the show was largely filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles, about 375 miles away. That’s little relief for neighbors, who have long dealt with tourists and fans posing in front of the home and sometimes blasting the sitcom’s theme song. Even Franklin, when he owned it, estimated that some 250 fans showed up daily to take pictures in front of the house. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

30,Eleanor Pringle,"Docusign CEO says while it’s true Americans work harder than Europeans, maybe Americans aren’t happier",https://fortune.com/2024/06/08/allan-thygesen-docusign-ceo-return-to-work-flexibility/,"Allan Thygesen says ""these are conscious choices that societies have made about the trade-off between work and leisure time.""",2024-06-08T09:00:00Z,"In a tech hub like San Francisco, it’s increasingly rare to find a job that will still let you work from home the majority of the week. But at $12 billion company Docusign, that’s still the case—in fact, nobody’s required to come into the office on a Friday. Allan Thygesen, the CEO of the agreement management platform, spoke to Fortune from the company’s London office as part of a global tour. The company saw exponential growth during the pandemic—booming by 60% when the corporate world went remote, and contracts had to be signed virtually. But when the globe returned to “normal,” Thygesen, a father of four born and raised in Denmark, wanted to retain some of the pandemic’s benefits, namely, a more flexible work model. So the company shed a significant amount of its office portfolio—half of its floors in San Francisco and Seattle—and asked its near-7,000 employees to come in two days a week instead: Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesdays and Thursdays.  No one is asked to come in on Fridays, though the offices are open. “I would say we’re very light-handed when it comes to enforcement,” he added.  “I don’t think we’ll be introducing anything draconian, I think relative even to the San Fransisco Bay Area and the Seattle area—which are both very tech-heavy and the last bastion of fully flexible work rules—we’re on the very flexible, very light requirement.” Thygesen’s laid-back approach differs from that of Mark Zuckerberg at Meta who, despite saying in 2020 that half his workforce would be remote by 2030, is now enforcing a three-day-a-week in-office policy or risk discipline.  Amazon pushed a similar mandate, which prompted something of a rebellion within its ranks, while Google’s plan to integrate office attendance with performance reviews has been subject to the ire of its union. “Any time you change these types of rules, people hate it because, of course, employees want maximum flexibility. It’s good for their personal lives,” he said.  “So there is a balance there between the needs of the company and what employees think is good for them. I do think people have come to understand that being fully remote is good in the moment, but it may not be great for your long-term career development, particularly early in your career.” Thygesen said he would sometimes go into the office at the end of the week, but he joked that it was a “lonely” experience.  However, the tech boss’s most “intense” meeting of the week—a product strategy review—is invariably conducted online with every contributor chiming in virtually. “These are very intense, very good meetings and there’s not a particular reason we all need to be in the same place,” Thygesen said. Thygesen’s meetings have become all the more intense this year after Docusign launched its new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) which will use AI to create, integrate and analyze agreements and documents more seamlessly. Nicholai Tangen, the CEO of Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, has noted that Americans work harder than their counterparts across the Atlantic. There’s a difference in the “general level of ambition,” Tangen told the Financial Times. “We [Europeans] are not very ambitious. I should be careful about talking about work-life balance, but the Americans just work harder.” Docusign’s Thygesen—an alumni of Stanford and the University of Copenhagen who now oversees teams working out of offices in India, Australia, America, France, Germany, and Japan, to name a few—has seen firsthand how different regions operate. He agrees that Tangen’s view is “objectively true,” but qualified: “There’s more to work than how many hours you do. I feel like my European teams work very smartly, they’re very efficient, work tends to be a bit more organized.” Thygesen and Tangen are correct, according to the data.  According to the European Union, in 2022 the average workweek of people between the ages of 22 and 65 was 37.5 hours.  The longest working weeks recorded were in Greece—41 hours a week—and Poland—40.4 hours.  By contrast, the Netherlands had the shortest working week of 33.2 hours, followed by Germany at 35.3 hours. Meanwhile, data from the International Labour Organization, last updated in January, showed the average hours workers clocked in the U.S. was 38 hours a week.  However, of those employees, 13% worked 49 hours or more per week, outstripping most European nations. Countries like the U.K. also have a statutory requirement entitling staff to 28 paid days of leave a year—if you’re a full-time employee.  In the U.S., it is not a legal requirement for staff to be given any paid time off; however, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average employee who is in their first year of service takes eight PTO days. Thygesen was also quick to point out that neither nation had made the wrong approach, but they simply had different priorities.  He explained: “These are conscious choices that societies have made about the trade-off between work and leisure time—maybe Americans aren’t necessarily happier.  “They’re certainly wealthier, and that gap has probably widened more over the last decade, but life is a holistic sum of all those things, so having spent time on both sides I see the merits of both.” Thygesen has a point here, too. The World Happiness Report 2024, released in March, found that four of the top five happiest countries on earth were European, and 14 of the top 20 were also from the continent.  Meanwhile, the U.S. fell to its lowest point since the report began in 2012, ranking 23. Headquartered in San Francisco, Docusign staffers could well form part of a community of tech employees bashing the city for increasing levels of crime and homelessness.  But criticism from the likes of Elon Musk may have skewed the reality that Thygesen, his family and his employees live in.  The Tesla CEO said last year the city was in a “doom spiral” having previously labeled downtown San Francisco a “disaster” and likened it to “a derelict zombie apocalypse.” Three of Thygesen’s four children live in the Bay Area, with the former Google president adding a milder evaluation than Musk: “San Francisco has always had pockets that were kind of rough and had a homeless problem—I do think that area is meaningfully larger now and unfortunately the people there are in worse shape.  “It’s not a good situation, it’s not good for the city, it’s not good for the people who live there, it’s not good for the people who are living on the streets.” But while San Fransisco has become the “poster child” for the problem, it’s a problem along the West Coast.  Thygesen said: “Our office is nowhere near these zones [in San Francisco], so I don’t think anybody has any concerns about coming in or using public or private transport. “We actually are closer to the problematic areas in Seattle and there it has been a bit of an issue because there have been minor safety issues and just the perception of it being uncomfortable is worse there. It’s endemic to a number of cities.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

31,"Bernard Condon, The Associated Press",They accrued debt to buy back their own stock. It led them to bankruptcy,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/zombie-companies-bankruptcy-stock-buybacks/,"Fallout from potential bankruptcy would be huge, as the companies in AP’s analysis employ at least 130 million people in a dozen countries.",2024-06-07T17:52:26Z,"An Associated Press analysis found the number of publicly-traded “zombie” companies — those so laden with debt they’re struggling to pay even the interest on their loans — has soared to nearly 7,000 around the world, including 2,000 in the United States. And many of them soon could be facing their day of reckoning, with due dates looming on hundreds of billions of dollars of loans they may not be able to pay back. “They’re going to get crushed,” Valens Securities Managing Director Robert Spivey said of the weakest zombies. Here are the key takeaways from the AP’s analysis: Zombies are commonly defined as companies that have failed to make enough money from operations in the past three years to pay even the interest on their loans. Their numbers have swelled because low interest rates for years allowed companies to pile up plenty of cheap debt, only to be whiplashed by stubborn inflation that has pushed borrowing costs to decade highs. AP’s analysis found their ranks in raw numbers have jumped over the past decade by a third or more in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the U.S., including companies that run Carnival Cruise Line, JetBlue Airways, Wayfair, Peloton, Italy’s Telecom Italia and British soccer giant Manchester United. Many zombies lack deep cash reserves, and the interest they pay on many of their loans is variable, not fixed, so higher rates are hurting them right now. As the number of zombies has grown, so too has the potential damage if they are forced to file for bankruptcy or close their doors permanently. Companies in AP’s analysis employ at least 130 million people in a dozen countries. Already, the number of U.S. companies going bankrupt has hit a 14-year high, a surge expected in a recession, not an expansion. Corporate bankruptcies have also recently hit highs of a nearly a decade or more in Canada, the U.K., France and Spain. For the first few months of this year, hundreds of zombies refinanced their loans as lenders opened their wallets in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would start cutting in March. That new money helped stocks of more than 1,000 zombies in AP’s analysis rise 20% or more in the past six months. But many did not or could not refinance, and time is running out. Through the summer and into September, when many investors now expect the first and only Fed cut this year, zombies will have to pay off $1.1 trillion of loans, according to AP’s analysis, two-thirds of the total due by the end of the year. Some experts say zombies may be able to avoid layoffs, selloff of business units or collapse if central banks cut interest rates soon, though scattered defaults and bankruptcies could still drag on the economy. For its part, Wall Street isn’t panicking. Investors have been buying stock of some zombies and their “junk bonds,” loans rating agencies deem most at risk of default. While that may help zombies raise cash in the short term, investors pouring money into these securities and pushing up their prices could eventually face heavy losses. “If rates stay at this level in the near future, we’re going to see more bankruptcies,” said George Cipolloni, a fund manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “At some point the money comes due and they’re not going to have it. It’s game over.” The dangers of companies piling on debt has been warned about by credit rating agencies and economists for years as interest rates fell but got a big push when central banks around the world cut benchmark rates to near zero in the 2009 financial crisis and then again in the 2020-21 pandemic. It was a giant, unprecedented experiment designed to spark a borrowing binge that would help avert a worldwide depression. It also created what some economists called a credit bubble that spread far beyond zombies, with low rates that also enticed heavy borrowing by governments, consumers and bigger, healthier companies. What set many zombies apart was that their debt was not used to expand, hire or invest in technology, but on such things as buying back their own stock. These so-called repurchases allow companies to “retire” shares, or take them off the market, a way to make up for new shares created for top executives to boost their pay packages. But too many stock buybacks can drain cash from a business. That was the case in the zombie failure of Bed Bath & Beyond. The retail chain that once operated 1,500 stores struggled for years, but its heavy borrowing and decision to spend $7 billion in a decade on buybacks played a key role in its downfall. Pay for just three top executives topped $140 million, according to executive data firm Equilar, even as its stock sunk from $80 to zero. Tens of thousands of workers in all 50 states lost their jobs as the chain spiraled to its bankruptcy filing last year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

A group of bondholders under a creditor committee entered into non-disclosure agreements with the government this week, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the talks are confidential.  The agreements will allow the government to share non-public information to facilitate discussions, one of the people said. Another person said bondholders and Ukraine are in restricted discussions as part of a consultation period to start a negotiation process. “Restricted” in the context of restructuring negotiations usually refers to talks that are covered by non-disclosure requirements as well as temporary trading limitations because the topics under discussion may be market-sensitive. The creditor group was first formed in April, but payments on Ukraine’s outstanding international bonds have been halted for more than two years since Russia attacked, upon an agreement with the bondholders. The moratorium the two sides agreed upon then is set to expire in August, raising the stakes for them to reach a deal quickly. Representatives for the bondholder committee declined to comment. A spokesperson from Ukraine’s finance ministry also declined to comment. The IMF is not a direct party to the talks with bondholders, but its spokeswoman Julie Kozack said yesterday in Washington that they were “on track.” The group representing bondholders includes Amundi, BlackRock and Amia Capital. JT Partners Inc acts as its financial adviser and Weil, Gotschal & Manges LLP is legal adviser to bondholders, while the country is represented by Rothschild and White & Case as financial and legal advisers, respectively. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that talks between Ukraine and bondholders are on track, adding that the economic outlook for the remainder of the year remains highly uncertain as the war continues. Under its $15.6 billion IMF program, Ukraine had said it aimed to complete the debt treatment with private creditors no later than mid-2024. The country’s dollar bonds due in 2035 were trading at 27.63 cents on the dollar, while the bonds due in 2026 were the best performers in emerging markets by percentage gained as of 4 p.m. in London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ukraine also has so-called GDP warrants maturing in 2041 whose payments are linked to economic growth, and which were trading at 51.70 cents on the dollar. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

33,Chloe Berger,Mark Cuban explains why he makes sure employees get rich whenever he sells a business,https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/mark-cuban-explains-why-he-makes-sure-employees-get-rich-whenever-he-sells-a-business/,“In every business I've sold I've paid out bonuses to every employee that was there more than a year.”,2024-06-07T19:02:00Z,"Like any true shark, Mark Cuban gets that everyone in the food chain has to eat. But he isn’t looking to swim alone. While he’s amassed a massive fortune as a billionaire, he also believes in sharing his wins with his employees. It’s just what you should do, investor and Shark Tank star Cuban says. No man, or shark, is an island, after all.  On Tuesday, Cuban noted that each time he’s sold a company he makes sure that he’s not the only one walking away with heavy pockets. “In every business I’ve sold I’ve paid out bonuses to every employee that was there more than a year,” he wrote.  Cuban founded MicroSolutions shortly after college, selling the consulting company in 1990 for $6 million. He shared 20% of the total sales price with the 80 employees then, he tweeted. That’s equal to around $15,000 per worker if equally divided, Cuban told CNBC Make It last year.  He then moved on to what would become Broadcast.com. The company catapulted Cuban into a young billionaire, after it went public and was bought by Yahoo in 1999. The deal proved sweet to his staff too, as Cuban tweeted that “300 out of 330 employees became millionaires.”  Bringing his employees up with him was the only thing that made sense to Cuban—they’re the ones that led to his success, after all. “It’s the right thing to do. No company is built alone,” Cuban told Fortune of his motivation in giving his employees a share of the sales.  Workers for HDNet, or what became AXS TV, raked in less when Cuban sold his majority stake in 2019. “HDNet wasn’t as big,” Cuban tweeted Tuesday, though he noted that he paid out 20% “of what I got to employees.” He added that layoffs were avoided after each sale except for at HDNet.  Cuban upheld his ethos when selling his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks last year for around $2 billion, before tax. “Mavs wasn’t a total exit,” he explained, but it resulted in a payout of more than $35 million to employees.  “As a thank you for all your hard work making the Mavs an amazing organization, each of you will be receiving a bonus from myself, and the Adelson and Dumont families,” he wrote in an email at the time, according to ESPN.com.  Bonuses were calculated by how long employees had worked for the Mavs, he added.  Anyone who has worked for a team, be it basketball or consulting group, knows it’s a collaborative effort that paves the way for success. Cuban seems to know as much, and doles out his bonuses accordingly. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

34,Bloomberg,"Africa loses 20,000 millionaires in 10 years as the wealthy flee the continent",https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/africa-loses-millionaires-currency-depreciation-ultra-rich-south-africa/,"Africa's wealth has diminished due to depreciating currencies and underperforming stock markets, according to investment consultancy Henley & Partners.",2024-06-07T18:07:25Z,"The number of millionaires living in Africa dropped by nearly 20,000 in the past decade as the continent’s ultra-rich either moved away or saw dramatic currency depreciations eat away at their wealth.   There are now just 135,200 individuals with wealth of $1 million or more, an 8% decline from 2013, according to a report by Henley & Partners. Along with the continent’s 342 centimillionaires and 21 billionaires, those individuals have total wealth of $2.5 trillion, the consultancy found.  “Currency depreciation and underperforming stock markets have chipped away at Africa’s wealth compared to global benchmarks,” Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said in the report. “With African stock markets underperforming against global peers, local property markets facing headwinds, and currencies depreciating against the dollar, African investors have seen their wealth eroded on multiple fronts.” Africa’s economies have faced multiple challenges over the past decade that have put strain on their budgets and currencies, from Covid-19 to rising interest rates to geopolitical tensions. South Africa, which has more than twice as many wealthy individuals as any other African country, has lost 20% of its millionaires in the last 10 years as the country battled logistics constraints, rolling blackouts and endemic crime and corruption.  During that time, the South African rand has fallen 43% against the greenback and the FTSE JSE All Share Index has also trailed the S&P 500.  Egypt and Nigeria, which are home to the next highest number of rich people after South Africa, have been grappling with runaway inflation, foreign-exchange shortages and multiple currency devaluations to allow their local units to trade more freely.  Despite all the challenges, Africa’s millionaire population is expected to rise by 65% in the next decade, according to the report. The gains will be driven by a surge in wealth in Mauritius, Namibia, Morocco, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda, which are all expected to experience at least 80% millionaire growth, the report said.  “Mauritius, with its stable governance and favorable tax regime, is projected to experience a remarkable 95% growth rate, positioning it as one of the world’s fastest-growing wealth markets,” the report said. “Namibia, too, is poised for impressive high-net-worth growth.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

35,Brad Haft,"From full-stack to machine learning, these are the best jobs in software engineering",https://fortune.com/education/articles/software-engineering-jobs/,There are hundreds of tech jobs to choose from—these are the 8 best ones in software engineering.,2024-06-07T18:22:37Z,"If you’re looking to make a move into software engineering, there’s good news: Demand for these roles is on the rise. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs available in the field is expected to grow by 25% by 2032.  To enter the software engineering industry or advance your career with a new job title, you’ll need to know the most common options, their pay rates and day-to-day responsibilities, and the skills needed to handle the workload.  If you’re looking to enter the tech workforce and don’t know where to start, Fortune ranked the best software engineering bootcamps.   Below are the top eight jobs for software engineers, ranging from data-heavy roles to creative-centric ones. Note: This list is alphabetical, and the salaries were sourced from Glassdoor. Pay may vary from company to company.   Average yearly salary: $157,000 For the past few years, data science has topped CompTIA’s State of the Tech Workforce report as the fastest-growing tech occupation, and for good reason. Data scientists are crucial in almost every industry, including healthcare, urban planning, and social media.  By utilizing models and algorithms to explore, analyze, and optimize data, their work involves solving problems and communicating results to stakeholders. There are two main routes to becoming a data scientist: obtaining either an undergraduate or graduate degree or attending bootcamps.  Skills: Proficiency in programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, as well as skills in machine learning, data visualization, and data mining, are essential. Additionally, soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication are important for success in this role, especially when working collaboratively in a team. If you’re interested in learning Python, either for this career path or maybe one of the ones listed below, we analyzed the 11 free and paid courses for beginners. Average yearly salary: $147,000 According to Acumen Research and Consulting, the global cloud computing market accounted for $495.3 billion in 2022 and is estimated to grow 17.8% by 2032. Also simply called “cloud engineers,” these highly skilled people are responsible for designing, developing, refining, and maintaining cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and storage services.  Cloud engineers typically have a background in computer science, information technology or a degree in a related field. Proficiency in Google Cloud, Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also a must.  If you don’t understand the cloud, try to think of services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365, Zoom, and even streaming apps like Spotify and Netflix. The cloud isn’t a physical thing but rather a network of remote storage servers that can be accessed on any device with an internet connection.  Skills: Cloud engineers’ technical skills revolve around understanding system architecture and automation while balancing soft skills like problem-solving and communication.  Average yearly salary: $162,000 According to tech staffing agency Mondo, cybersecurity engineers are among the highest-paid professionals in the cyber field. They play a crucial role in implementing and testing new security features, responding to data breaches, and overall playing digital defense against threats. Typically, people in these roles hold either a bachelor’s or master’s degree in cybersecurity or alternatively earn certifications like the CompTIA Security+ or the GIAC Security Essentials certification. Skills: Python, JavaScript, SQL, PowerShell, and Bash are among the most common programming languages for cybersecurity professionals. Some soft skills include adaptability, attention to detail, and an eye for computer forensics.  Average yearly salary: $164,000 As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to advance, there is an increasing need for people skilled in developing, training, implementing, and updating automation and AI systems. Machine learning engineers dedicate their time to gathering and preparing data, constructing and refining models, and collaborating across teams to get these models into production. Think: The team behind OpenAI’s GPT-4o.  Skills: This role involves coding languages like Python—the language of choice in machine learning—or Java and C++ while using data libraries like TensorFlow, Microsoft Azure, and PyTorch.   Average yearly salary: $140,000 A DevOps engineer is a professional who excels in both software development and operations, serving as the bridge between development and IT teams. They establish an effective workflow, enabling developers to introduce new features and build applications while ensuring that operations teams maintain the stability of released applications. This job is typically reserved for people with university-level education, postgraduate degrees, or industry certifications. Microsoft offers a free 9-module, self-paced DevOps engineer training course with an expert-level certification.  Skills: Experience with programming languages, data management, library updates, and security systems is essential for this role. Familiarity with Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is also required. Strong analytical, problem-solving, and teamwork skills are a must. Average yearly salary: $120,000 Becoming a full-stack developer involves tackling both the front-end and back-end of web development and taking responsibility for designing, building, and maintaining an application or website. This includes using tools like Figma for UX/UI design and APIs and databases for processing and storing site data.  To land a job in this field, whether as a freelancer or full-time employee, it’s essential to build a strong portfolio showcasing various projects on the client and server side.  If you’re looking to hop into this career path but don’t want to do it alone or for a high price tag, we rounded up five web development bootcamps. Skills: There are several regularly used programming languages in full-stack web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and C++, Python, and Ruby for the back end. Similar to cloud engineers, full-stack developers should also have a good understanding of streaming technologies for internet-based tasks. Lastly, continuous learning and a growth mindset are crucial aspects of this role, as they enable developers to understand and fix coding issues when they arise. Average yearly salary: $116,000 The gaming industry is projected to reach $312 billion by 2027, making it one of the hottest industries on the planet, but for video games to exist, there must also be game developers. These professionals merge sleek user interfaces with game logic, artificial intelligence, and creative visual design. They collaborate closely with game designers to translate concepts into code. These developers iterate and refine gameplay for production on a day-to-day basis. Full Sail University offers video game development programs, but learning the basics of programming independently or through regular computer science classes is entirely possible with dedication and a study routine.  Skills: Game developers should know how to code for console, computer, or mobile and also understand new trends like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and extended reality (ER). Common programming languages in the video game industry are Java, Python, HTML5, and JavaScript.  Average yearly salary: $117,000 There are more than 1 billion active iPhones and more than 3 billion active Android devices. Mobile app developers are responsible for products like Safari, Google Chrome, Instagram, TikTok, your cell phone’s calculator, and everything in between. More specifically, they conceptualize, program, debug, maintain, and update platforms ranging from video games to utility.  Skills: Apps either run on Apple’s proprietary iOS or the Android open-source operating system. The former is typically coded in Swift, and the latter is typically coded in Java.  Software engineering is a rewarding career choice for several reasons. Just think about it—software is everywhere, from smartphones and smart home appliances to computers, wearables, chatbots, satellites, and content management systems. It’s omnipresent, and someone has to design, test, and develop it.  Other reasons to dive into a software engineering job include: Whatever your reason for selecting a software engineering job, it’s important to prioritize roles that resonate with your career goals and passions. Whether you have transferable skills, a strong affinity for numbers, a natural inclination for coding, or a passion for video games, finding a role that aligns with your strengths is important.  Remember that the positions we mentioned are typically not entry-level, as they demand years of experience in programming and project management. If you’re aiming for such roles, consider gaining relevant experience through internships or by filling your portfolio with projects related to the field. To become a software engineer, it’s important to have strong technical skills such as programming proficiency and a deep understanding of computer systems. Additionally, a passion for problem-solving, attention to detail, and patience are essential traits for excelling in this field. While a formal degree is not always necessary for entry-level positions, showcasing your skills through a portfolio filled with relevant projects can be an effective way to demonstrate your qualifications to potential employers or clients. From our research, we found that machine learning engineers are among the top-paid professions in the software engineering field, with an average yearly salary of $164,000.   © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

36,Christiaan Hetzner,Musk says retail shareholders still back him despite $1.7 trillion oil fund saying they will vote against his pay package,https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-shareholder-meeting-retail-investors/,Continued lobbying on Elon Musk's behalf all the way down to the wire suggests the risk of a ‘no’ vote at this Thursday's annual shareholder meeting is not negligent.,2024-06-10T14:13:26Z,"If all else fails, Elon Musk can always count on his fan base turning out to back him. With little over two days left before the deadline for remote voting closes, the Tesla CEO and his otherwise media-shy chair, Robyn Denholm, have mounted a last-second campaign blitz aimed at pushing his record pay deal over the finish line. Their continued lobbying on his behalf all the way down to the wire suggests the risk of a no vote at this Thursday’s annual shareholder meeting is not negligible after news that major institutional investors such as Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund and CalPERS, the largest public pension scheme in the U.S., both plan to veto his $55 billion pay deal. “So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions,” Musk replied this weekend to Zero Hedge, a publication slanted against Tesla and EVs but pro-Musk thanks to his antiestablishment politics.  Tesla’s retail investor community, estimated to hold just over 40% of its stock, is utterly unlike any other for a publicly traded corporation.  While Apple can boast of similarly high figures, only Tesla’s is highly organized, extremely motivated, and effective at amplifying gains or cushioning falls.  This helps explain why it still trades at growth stock levels of over 50 times next year’s earnings despite sales grinding to a halt and profit margins shrinking.  Individuals such as Farzad Mesbahi, Dave Lee, and Warren Redlich are well-known to small Tesla investors.  They often host each other in a bid to reinforce the message that Musk will create generational wealth while propelling Tesla to become the world’s most valuable company. Warning to all fund managers, banks and brokers 🌐The Tesla retail army, 10,000,000 people worldwide,  will take action, when they discover in the next 3 months how you voted your proxies. Most funds and brokerage services are interchangeable.  Do this at your own risk.… pic.twitter.com/xKxo9agr0s Small shareholders only became a pillar of support after Tesla soared thanks partly to a pandemic-era cocktail of record stimulus and rolling lockdowns.  This same combustible mixture helped spark the get-rich-quick frenzy that launched the YOLO communities around crypto tokens, such as Musk’s favored Dogecoin, and meme stocks like GameStop.  But the once close-knit group of small shareholders has splintered.  A few are now openly calling out the CEO they feel has been dishonest about the direction of the company, sold his shares near the top, and repeatedly abused his sway with leading social media influencers to keep the faithful placated. This betrayal by critical Tesla fans has angered people like Yaman Tasdivar, who hosts a recurring Tesla Spaces on X that used to be called “Tesla will triple in 2022” (it fell 65% that year thanks to Musk’s Twitter deal).  Many like him feel like these apostates among Tesla’s faithful have been little more than fair-weather friends of Musk.  I'm taking names.@KoguanLeo@CalPERS @NicolaiTang1 @FredericLambert@GerberKawasaki @issgovernance @GlassLewisWho else is voting against Elon? “I’m taking names,” he wrote, starting his list with Singapore-based billionaire Leo Koguan. The latter, Tesla’s third-largest individual investor, has openly called for the board to remove Musk and pledged to vote against his pay package immediately after it was proposed. Dillon Loomis, host of the Tesla-themed YouTube show Electrified with its 111,000 subscribers, warned these traitors would not be welcome back into the fold once Musk delivers on his promise to grow Tesla into the most valuable company in the world. “You don’t get to try to sabotage one of the most important companies on the planet and then celebrate with us when the payoff for patience and trusting the man behind Tesla…arrives,” he posted last week. Even the devoted have their price, however.  Retail shareholder Redlich, best known for saying he would lay down his life for Musk, admitted that he sold a fifth of his personal holdings at $175 a share last month.  The lawyer, by training, blamed the move on the risk that Musk would resign in the event of a no vote. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

37,Niamh Rowe,"Uniswap Labs acquires Crypto: The Game—’It’s ballooned into this 24/7, crypto reality show’",https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/10/uniswap-labs-acquires-crypto-the-game-its-ballooned-into-this-24-7-crypto-reality-show/,Crypto: The Game has been likened to the Web3 version of Squid Game.,2024-06-10T15:00:00Z,"The second season of Crypto: The Game (CTG) sold out in 13 minutes. Thousands of fans scrambled for one of 800 coveted spots on the survival game built on the Base blockchain. Given this popularity among crypto’s core community and the growing interest of outsiders, decentralized exchange Uniswap Labs announced today it has acquired the game. “We’ve seen CTG generate a ton of excitement and Uniswap is focused on making on-chain experiences more human and fun,” Uniswap Labs’ chief operating officer Mary-Catherine Lader told Fortune. The purchase amount is undisclosed, but is a mixture of cash, tokens, and equity. As part of the acquisition, founders Dylan Abruscato, Tyler Cagle, and Bryan Lee will join Uniswap. Together the companies are currently working on developing season three, while also exploring new interactive consumer crypto experiences. However, the game will not simply become an advertisement for Uniswap’s wallet or exchange, the companies explained on a call. “Now we have the full force of Uniswap Labs behind us, we think that’s going to help us make season three the best one yet,” Dylan Abruscato, the game’s cofounder, told Fortune. Abruscato’s entertainment career spans beyond crypto, as his previous gigs include working as a producer for Saturday Night Live and developing once-viral mobile game HQ Trivia. CTG has drawn inspiration from TV shows that pit contestants against one another like Survivor and Squid Game. In the first two seasons of CTG, contestants bought in with 0.1 ETH (about $367), joined ten tribes of 80, participated in daily challenges, and voted one another out over 10 days, until one person won the entire pot. A Japan-based player won the grand prize pot of over $150,000 in season one, with the prize pool growing to around $250,000 by season two. Uniswap Labs sponsored a challenge in season two, joining the likes of Adidas—which created branded tracksuits for each player in the form of non-fungible tokens—and crypto firm Wormhole, among other partners. The sponsorship gave Uniswap a “behind-the-scenes look into how [CTG] cracked this code for bringing new users into crypto,” Lader said. Digital tracksuits for Adidas x CTG s2 We look forward to Season 3 🔴 pic.twitter.com/PXbe0f07zQ Following its launch at the end of January, followed shortly by a second season in April, the game has generated cultlike status within crypto, with speculators watching from the sidelines via X, Farcaster, and even a podcast created by Web3 and culture media outlet Boys’ Club. “My 68-year-old mother-in-law called me after listening to a podcast episode and asked if I thought if Ted was going to buy back in and play anonymously after she got voted out,” Abruscato said. Abruscato described the fandom as a mixture of crypto Twitter enthusiasts, venture capitalists, founders, and notable crypto influencers such as 3LAU, Packy McCormick, Jesse Pollak, and Bored Elon. But, more crucially, about 10%–15% are “normies,” in other words, those who have never before engaged with crypto, suggesting the game can be an opportunity to onboard new users to decentralized finance. While CTG can’t calculate the precise number of onlookers who watched the game last season, Abruscato says there were 50,000 unique visitors on the site during a 10-day period. “It’s ballooned into this 24/7 crypto reality show where there are villain arcs, drama, and fan favorites, and it’s kind of become this spectacle in the crypto community,” said Abruscato. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

38,Ryan Hogg,BP managers told to disclose office romances from the last 3 years or face the sack,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/11/bp-managers-given-ultimatum-disclose-all-office-romances-from-the-last-3-years-or-face-the-sack/,"BP updated is rules months after sacking its CEO Bernard Looney for ""not being fully transparent"" about past relationships.",2024-06-11T10:02:44Z,"After ousting BP CEO Bernard Looney for failing to disclose personal relationships at work, the $100 billion oil giant isn’t taking another chance on its lovestruck managers. In an email circulated to staff last week, BP told employees they were now required to disclose all “familial and intimate relationships at work” or face following Looney out the door, Reuters first reported. To avoid an embarrassing repeat of the Looney situation, BP has also updated its code of conduct, which “prohibits employees from directly or indirectly managing relatives or those with whom they’re in an intimate relationship.”  Previously, employees were only required to disclose relationships if there was a chance it created a conflict of interest. Now, however, BP’s top 4,500 managers have been given three months to report all intimate relationships they have engaged in in the past three years, The Guardian reported. That length of time might reopen some old wounds for BP employees. A representative for BP told Fortune that starting June 1, staff would be forced to disclose personal relationships “whether or not they feel they represent a conflict of interest. “As a policy that forms part of BP’s code of conduct, noncompliance with the policy could result in disciplinary action,” the spokesperson added. Some seven months after ending Looney’s three-year tenure at the top of BP, the group continues to deal with the aftereffects of his messy departure.  Looney abruptly stepped down as BP boss in September last year after the company said he “was not fully transparent” about his past relationships with colleagues. He allegedly failed to disclose several past relationships with BP employees prior to an investigation into his conduct.   Staff allege Looney’s behavior was well-known and discussed privately for years. The former boss was also accused of promoting women with whom he had intimate relationships before he became CEO, the Financial Times reported. Looney was formally sacked in December and forfeited as much as $40.6 million in pay following his dismissal, including some of his salary, bonus, and pension allowance, after the BP board determined his actions amounted to “serious misconduct.” While BP’s move to tighten its conduct rules is invariably tied to Looney’s behavior, it does appear to reinforce a trend of more hawkishness from employers toward workplace romances. Last year, U.K. broadcaster ITV drew up strict new conduct rules that reportedly required staff to disclose all sexual relationships and even friendships they had with colleagues. Like BP, the broadcaster had its own historical motivations to launch the policy review. Former This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield was forced to resign after admitting to having an affair with one of his colleagues while working at the company. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

40,"Wyatte Grantham-Philips, The Associated Press",U.S. gas prices are falling as summer approaches and could continue dropping if hurricanes don’t hit: ‘Prices move on fear’,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/us-gas-prices-falling-summer-continue-dropping-hurricanes/,"The national average for gas prices on Monday stood around $3.44, according to AAA.",2024-06-11T09:38:08Z,"Gas prices are once again on the decline across the U.S., bringing some relief to drivers now paying a little less to fill up their tanks. The national average for gas prices on Monday stood around $3.44, according to AAA. That’s down about 9 cents from a week ago — marking the largest one-week drop recorded by the motor club so far in 2024. Monday’s average was also more than 19 cents less than it was a month ago and over 14 cents below the level seen this time last year. Why the recent fall in prices at the pump? Industry analysts point to a blend of lackluster demand and strong supply — as well as relatively mild oil prices worldwide. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know. There are a few factors contributing to today’s falling gas prices. For starters, fewer people may be hitting the road. “Demand is just kind of shallow,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said, pointing to trends seen last year and potential lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Traditionally — pre-pandemic — after Memorial Day, demand would start to pick up in the summertime. And we just don’t see it anymore.” Last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed that U.S. gasoline demand slipped to about 8.94 billion barrels a day. That might still sound like a lot — but before the pandemic, consumption was closer to the 10 billion barrel-a-day range at this time of year, Gross noted. Beyond pandemic-specific impacts, experts note that high gas prices seen following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and persistent inflation may have led many Americans to modify their driving habits. Other contributing factors could be the increased number of fuel-efficient cars, as well as electric vehicles, on the road today, Gross said. Some of this is still seasonal. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that gas prices typically ease in early summer because of refinery capacity. At this time of year, he said, many factors boosting prices in late winter and early spring — particularly refinery maintenance — are no longer present. “Once refinery maintenance is done, output or utilization of the nation’s refineries goes up — and that contributes to rising supply,” De Haan said. And that stronger supply, paired with weaker consumption, has lead to a “bit more noticeable” decline in prices this year. He added that U.S. refinery utilization is at some of its highest levels since the pandemic. Separately, the Biden administration announced last month that it would be releasing 1 million gasoline barrels, or about 42 million gallons, from a Northeast reserve with an aim of lowering prices at the pump this summer. But De Haan noted that such action has little impact nationally — 42 million gallons equals less that three hours of U.S. daily gas consumption. “Really, what we’re seeing right now with (declining) gasoline prices … has been driven primarily by seasonal and predictable economics,” he said. Experts also point to cooling oil costs. Prices at the pump are highly dependent on crude oil, which is the main ingredient in gasoline. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has stayed in the mid $70s a barrel over recent weeks — closing at under $78 a barrel Monday. That’s “not a bad place for it to be,” Gross said, noting that the cost of crude typically needs to go above $80 to put more pressure on pump prices. Oil prices can be volatile and hard to predict because they’re subject to many global forces. That includes production cuts from OPEC and allied oil producing countries, which have previously contributed to rising energy prices. OPEC+ recently announced plans to extend three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day — but the alliance also put a timetable on restoring some production, “which is likely why the price of oil had somewhat of a bearish reaction,” De Haan said. The future is never promised. But, if there are no major unexpected interruptions, both Gross and De Haan say that prices could keep working their way down. At this time of year, experts keep a particular eye out for hurricane risks — which can cause significant damage and lead refineries to power down. “Prices move on fear,” Gross said. In the U.S., he added, concern particularly rises once a hurricane enters the Gulf of Mexico — and even if it doesn’t eventually make landfall, refineries may pull back on operations out of caution. Impacts can also range by region. But barring the unexpected, analysts like De Haan expect the national average to stay in the range of $3.35 to $3.70 per gallon. Gas prices typically drop even more in the fall, and it’s possible that we could see the national average below $3 in late October or early November, he said. While gas prices nationwide are collectively falling, some states, of course, always have cheaper averages than others, due to factors ranging from nearby refinery supply to local fuel requirements. As of Monday, per AAA data, Mississippi had the lowest average gas price at about $2.94 per gallon — followed by $2.95 Oklahoma and just under $2.97 in Arkansas. Meanwhile, California, Hawaii and Washington had the highest average prices on Monday — at about $4.93, $4.75 and $4.41 per gallon, respectively. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

41,"Lea Skene, The Associated Press",Baltimore shipping channel closed after Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse finally fully reopens,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/baltimore-shipping-channel-closed-francis-scott-key-bridge-collapse-reopens/,"It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.",2024-06-11T08:45:13Z,"The main shipping channel into Baltimore’s port has fully reopened to its original depth and width following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which blocked most maritime traffic into the harbor. Officials announced the full reopening in a news release Monday evening. It comes after a massive cleanup effort as crews removed an estimated 50,000 tons of steel and concrete from the Patapsco River. The channel was blocked by wreckage of the fallen bridge, which collapsed after a container ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns, sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. All of the victims were Latino immigrants working an overnight shift to fill potholes on the bridge. The Port of Baltimore, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, was effectively closed for several weeks while the wreckage was removed. Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. On May 20, the wayward cargo ship Dali was refloated and guided back to port. The vessel had been stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow. After the Dali was moved, crews opened a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide, which means two-way traffic can resume, officials said. They said other additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width. Thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse, prompting local and state officials to prioritize reopening the port and restoring its traffic to normal capacity in hopes of easing the economic ripple effects. The announcement Monday means the commerce that depends on the busy port can begin ramping back up. Officials said a total of 56 federal, state and local agencies participated in the salvage operations, including about 500 specialists from around the world who operated a fleet of 18 barges, 22 tugboats, 13 floating cranes, 10 excavators and four survey boats. “I cannot overstate how proud I am of our team,” said Col. Estee Pinchasin, Baltimore district commander for the Army Corps of Engineers. “It was incredible seeing so many people from different parts of our government, from around our country and all over the world, come together in the Unified Command and accomplish so much in this amount of time.” In a statement Monday, Pinchasin also acknowledged the loss of the victims’ families. “Not a day went by that we didn’t think about all of them, and that kept us going,” she said. The Dali lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka in the early hours of March 26. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found it experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the collapse. Officials have said they hope to rebuild the bridge by 2028. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

42,"Scott McFettridge, The Associated Press",Dairy farmers look to poultry industry that had to kill 100 million birds for guidance,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/dairy-farmers-poultry-industry-kill-100-million-birds-guidance-bird-flu-epidemic/,"Dairy farmers could try to implement similar safeguards, but the vast differences between the animals and the industries limit what lessons can be learned and applied.",2024-06-11T08:38:06Z,"As the U.S. dairy industry confronts a bird flu outbreak, with cases reported at dozens of farms and the disease spreading to people, the egg industry could serve as an example of how to slow the disease but also shows how difficult it can be to eradicate the virus. There have been earlier bird flu outbreaks in the U.S., but the current one started in February 2022 and has forced the slaughter of nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys. Hot spots still occur, but their frequency has dropped in part because of biosecurity efforts at farms and a coordinated approach between companies and agricultural officials, experts say. Dairy farmers could try to implement similar safeguards, but the vast differences between the animals and the industries limit what lessons can be learned and applied. It’s commonly called bird flu because the disease is largely spread by wild birds that can survive infections. Many mammals have caught the illness too, including sea lions and skunks. Animals can be infected by eating an infected bird or by being exposed to environments where the virus is present. That said, there are big differences in how cows and chickens have fared after getting infected. Bird flu is typically fatal to chickens and turkeys within days of an infection, leading to immediate mass killings of birds. That’s not true for cows. Dairies in several states have reported having to kill infected animals because symptoms continued to linger and their milk production didn’t recover, but that’s not the norm, said Russ Daly, an extension veterinarian at South Dakota State University. He said it appears that bird flu isn’t usually fatal to cows but that an infected animal can be more vulnerable to other ailments typically founds in dairies, such as bacterial pneumonia and udder infections. Egg operators have become clean freaks. To prevent disease from spreading, egg producers require workers to shower and change into clean clothes before they enter a barn and shower again when they leave. They also frequently wash trucks and spray tires with solutions to kill off virus remnants. Many egg operations even use lasers and install special fencing to discourage wild birds from stopping by for a visit. “Gone is the day of the scarecrow,” said Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board. Without these efforts, the current outbreak would be much worse, said Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agriculture business professor. Still, maintaining such vigilance is difficult, even if the cost of allowing disease into an operation is so high, she said. Chickens raised for meat, known as broilers, also have been infected with bird flu but such cases are less common. In part, that’s because broiler chickens are killed when they’re only 6 to 8 weeks old, so they have less time to get infected. Yes and no. Dairies can certainly reduce the spread of disease by limiting access to barns, so people and equipment don’t bring in the virus from elsewhere. Workers could also wear eye protection, aprons and gloves to try to protect themselves, but there’s no way around it: Big animals are messy. “The parlor is a warm, humid place with lots of liquid flying around, whether it’s urine, feces, water because they’re spraying off areas. Cows might kick off a milk machine so you get milk splatter,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Laboratory. Dairies also don’t have time or staff to disinfect milking equipment between animals, so equipment could become contaminated. Pasteurization kills bacteria and viruses in milk, making it safe for people to drink. Poulsen said the dairy industry could follow a path laid by the poultry and pork industries and establish more formal, better funded research organizations so it could respond more quickly to problems like bird flu — or avoid them altogether. The dairy industry also could tamp down disease spread by limiting the movement of lactating cows between states, Poulsen said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will soon begin testing a vaccine that could be given to calves, offering the animals protection and also reducing the chance of worker illnesses. The egg industry also is hopeful researchers can develop vaccines for poultry that could be quick, inexpensive and effective. Workers can’t give shots to the millions of hens that might need a vaccine, but industry officials hope a vaccine could be distributed in the water the birds drink, in the pellets they eat or even before birds hatch from their eggs. Efforts to develop vaccines have become even more important now that the disease has spread to dairy cows and even a few people, Thompson said. “Part or what is being developed right now is, what way can we vaccinate them that is cost-effective and disease resistant?” Thompson said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The recall covers certain model year 2022 Dodge Durango, Ram 2500 and Ram 3500 vehicles. According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, these cars may experience a malfunction in their anti-lock braking control module — which could cause stability control, a key safety feature, to fail and increase the risk of crash as a result. As a remedy, dealers will update the anti-lock braking control module software for free. Notification letters to dealers and owners are set to be mailed out July 26, the NHTSA notes. It’s unclear if the update will be available for all impact owners before then. Stellantis advises customers with questions or concerns to contact their dealers or Chrysler’s recall assistance center. In a statement, a Stellantis spokesperson noted a “routine review of customer feedback” led to a company investigation that discovered the software problem impacting certain vehicles. To date, Chrysler is unware of any related injuries or accidents — but “urges customers to follow the instructions on their recall notices,” the spokesperson added. Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler expects a total of 211,581 vehicles — produced in select periods ranging between April 2021 and December 2022 — have this defect in the U.S. That includes 524 Ram 3500s, 157,890 Ram 2500s and 53,167 Dodge Durangos, per the NHTSA report. Some “similar vehicles” not included in this recall were produced before or after suspected periods impacted and/or have different anti-lock braking control module software, the report notes. Drivers can confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHSTA site and/or Chrysler’s recall lookup. Beyond the U.S., an estimated 17,462 vehicles will be subject to recall in Canada, in addition to 2,313 in Mexico another 5,023 in certain markets outside North America, Stellantis’ spokesperson said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

44,"Matthew Perrone, The Associated Press",Alzheimer’s drug from Eli Lilly that can slow brain-robbing disease backed by FDA advisers,https://fortune.com/well/2024/06/11/alzheimers-drug-eli-lilly-brain-robbing-disease-backed-fda-advisers/,"If the agency agrees with the panel's recommendation, the drug, donanemab, would only be the second Alzheimer’s drug cleared in the U.S.",2024-06-11T09:17:52Z,"A closely watched Alzheimer’s drug from Eli Lilly won the backing of federal health advisers on Monday, setting the stage for the treatment’s expected approval for people with mild dementia caused by the brain-robbing disease. Food and Drug Administration advisers voted unanimously that the drug’s ability to slow the disease outweighs its risks, including side effects like brain swelling and bleeding that will have to be monitored. “I thought the evidence was very strong in the trial showing the effectiveness of the drug,” said panel member Dean Follmann, a National Institutes of Health statistician. The FDA will make the final decision on approval later this year. If the agency agrees with the panel’s recommendation, the drug, donanemab, would only be the second Alzheimer’s drug cleared in the U.S. that’s been shown to convincingly slow cognitive decline and memory problems due to Alzheimer’s. The FDA approved a similar infused drug, Leqembi, from Japanese drugmaker Eisai last year. The slowdown seen with both drugs amounts to several months and experts disagree on whether patients or their loved ones will be able to detect the difference. But Lilly’s approach to studying its once-a-month treatment prompted questions from FDA reviewers. Patients in the company’s study were grouped based on their levels of a brain protein, called tau, that predicts severity of cognitive problems. That led FDA to question whether patients might need to be screened via brain scans for tau before getting the drug. But most panelists thought there was enough evidence of the drug’s benefit to prescribe it broadly, without screening for the protein. “Imposing a requirement for tau imaging is not necessary and would raise serious practical and access concerns to the treatment,” said Dr. Thomas Montine of Stanford University, who chaired the panel and summarized its opinion. At a high level, Lilly’s results mirrored those of Leqembi, with both medications showing a modest slowing of cognitive problems in patients with early-stage Alzheimer’s. The Indianapolis-based company conducted a 1,700-patient study showing patients who received monthly IV infusions of its drug declined about 35% more slowly than those who got a sham treatment. The FDA had been widely expected to approve the drug in March. But instead the agency said it would ask its panel of neurology experts to publicly review the company’s data, an unexpected delay that surprised analysts and investors. Several unusual approaches in how Lilly tested its drug led to the meeting. One change was measuring patients’ tau, and excluding patients with very low or no levels of the protein. But panelists said there was enough data from other measures to feel confident that nearly all patients could benefit from the drug, regardless of their levels. In another key difference, Lilly studied taking patients off its drug when they reached very low levels of amyloid, a sticky brain plaque that’s a contributor to Alzheimer’s. Lilly scientists suggested stopping treatment is a key advantage for its drug, which could reduce side effects and costs. But FDA staff said Lilly provided little data supporting the optimal time to stop or how quickly patients might need to restart treatment. Despite those questions, many panelists thought the possibility of stopping doses held promise. “It’s a huge cost savings for the society, we’re talking about expensive treatment, expensive surveillance,” said Dr. Tanya Simuni of Northwestern University. She and other experts said patients would need to be tracked and tested to see how they fare and whether they need to resume treatment. The main safety issue with donanemab was brain swelling and bleeding, a problem common to all amyloid-targeting drugs. Most cases identified in Lilly’s trial were mild. Three deaths in the donanemab study were linked to the drug, according to the FDA, all involving brain swelling or bleeding. One of the deaths was caused by a stroke, a life-threatening complication that occurs more frequently among Alzheimer’s patients. FDA’s panel agreed that those the risks could be addressed by warning labels and education for doctors as well as medical scans to identify patients at greater risk of stroke. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

45,Eleanor Pringle,Musk says he'll lock iPhones in an electromagnetic cage at his businesses after Apple announces OpenAI partnership,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/elon-musk-iphones-banned-tesla-x-after-openai-apple-partnership/,Sam Altman's OpenAI and Tim Cook's Apple announced a partnership of ChatGPT in OS services. Elon Musk said he will ban iPhones at his businesses.,2024-06-11T10:32:47Z,"A little over 12 hours ago, Apple announced that OpenAI’s ChatGPT would be integrated into its technology, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk wasted no time battening down the hatches against the rival technology. Formerly the world’s richest man, Musk is developing his own artificial intelligence models at EV maker Tesla and startup xAI. xAI has already released a large language model named Grok. But not only is ChatGPT a competitor to Musk’s own offerings, the entrepreneur also has an acrimonious history with the Sam Altman–led company. Musk was one of the earliest backers of the AI company and served as one of its first cochairs (alongside Altman) when it launched. The relationship soured when Musk left in 2018. A war of words and rival products ensued, culminating in Musk launching an ongoing lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI. It’s therefore little surprise to witness Musk’s fury upon hearing Apple’s announcement yesterday that it is “integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise—as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities—without needing to jump between tools.” Musk aired his concerns about the partnership on his social media platform, X, formerly known as Twitter. “If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,” he wrote. “That is an unacceptable security violation. “And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage.” A Faraday cage is used to block some electromagnetic fields.  If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation. Apple outlined a raft of privacy measures related to AI at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference in California. While CEO Tim Cook said the company’s new AI strategy and features, named Apple Intelligence, is the “next big step” for his company, the organization also laid out what it believes is a “new frontier” for privacy in artificial intelligence. The cloud intelligence system, named Private Cloud Compute (PCC), was created to “make sure that personal user data sent to PCC isn’t accessible to anyone other than the user—not even to Apple.” Apple’s 10-page, near-4,000-word announcement of PCC also promises “more to come” from the company on user privacy and forms only part of its AI security strategy. Alongside the reveal of the PCC system—which Apple said independent experts can inspect to verify privacy—the company, with an approximately $3 trillion market cap, specifically addressed concerns relating to OpenAI. It said: “Privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT—their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won’t store requests. ChatGPT’s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.” An announcement by OpenAI mirrored the pledges: “Privacy protections are built in when accessing ChatGPT within Siri and Writing Tools—requests are not stored by OpenAI, and users’ IP addresses are obscured.” Musk is seemingly unconvinced, particularly because Apple is using an outside source instead of building its own.  He wrote on X: “It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security and privacy. Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.” Apple and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river. On a roll with his criticism of the partnership, Musk continued to post a meme showing Apple and OpenAI sharing the data gathered from iPhones, before adding: “Here’s the problem with ‘agreeing’ to share your data: Nobody actually reads the terms and conditions.” Musk fans are used to the billionaire teasing them about what he might be working on next—and for years, they have theorized about whether a Musk entity will release a smartphone. The partnership between Apple—which the SpaceX owner has found himself in a bunfight with before—and OpenAI has reignited these rumors and were stoked by Musk himself. One user on X said they wanted a Grok phone, to which Musk replied: “If Apple actually integrates woke nanny AI spyware into their OS, we might need to do that!” When another user suggested X might link up with an Android-phone maker for a product, Musk added: “It is not out of the question.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

46,"Ewa Krukowska, Petra Sorge, Anna Shiryaevskaya, Kamil Kowalcze, Bloomberg",Europe plotting to keep last remaining Russia-Ukraine gas pipeline flowing with Azerbaijan’s help,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/11/europe-plotting-to-keep-last-remaining-russia-ukraine-gas-pipeline-flowing-with-azerbaijans-help/,European officials are speaking with energy companies in Azerbaijan about whether they could inject gas into the last remaining Russia-Ukraine pipeline to keep it flowing.,2024-06-11T10:06:32Z,"European officials are in talks to keep gas flowing through a key Russia-Ukraine pipeline, as they race to prevent Moscow’s war further damaging the continent’s energy supplies. Europe has tried to wean itself off Russian gas but several eastern European states continue to receive it through a pipeline that crosses Ukraine. The agreement that covers this transit arrangement expires at the end of this year. And with war raging, most market watchers expect the gas to finally come to a halt. But European government and company officials are talking to counterparts in Ukraine about how to keep the gas flowing next year, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named as the talks are private. One option that’s been discussed is for European companies to buy and inject gas from Azerbaijan into Russian pipelines heading to Europe, according to some of the people. Such an arrangement would allow Europe to avoid the embarrassment of buying Russian gas at a time when it’s trying to crimp Moscow’s revenues.  European benchmark gas prices fell as much as 2.2% on Tuesday after Bloomberg reported the talks.  The idea is gaining momentum as it becomes clear that Ukraine would be in favor. Transit revenue amounted to about $1 billion in 2021 — providing crucial funding for the war-ravaged economy. There are also concerns that disused pipelines could become military targets, or fall into disrepair that’s costly to reverse. “There are two factors we should always remember,” Oleksiy Chernyshov, chief executive of Ukraine’s state-run Naftogaz, told Bloomberg News. “One is that Ukraine has incredible infrastructure of transit and storage gas, which should be used, and Ukraine is predisposed to use this infrastructure because it brings a lot of advantages.” He ruled out any plan that involved working with Russia’s Gazprom PJSC, and said bringing gas from Azerbaijan “might have some future.” Azerbaijan’s state-run energy company Socar didn’t respond to requests for comment. The energy ministry in Baku, which has repeatedly sought to increase exports to Europe, couldn’t immediately comment. The Russian government and Gazprom didn’t respond to requests for comment.  A plan to use Azeri gas could in theory benefit Russia if it was set up as a swap that allowed Moscow to send its gas elsewhere. Russia has struggled to find enough new customers for the fuel as its infrastructure is set up to supply Europe, and China is driving a hard bargain. The idea of swaps is not alien to oil and gas markets and is used when it’s not possible to physically deliver fuel from one location to another. Azerbaijan is already using its pipeline to Europe at full capacity. Talks are in early phase and people familiar with the matter expect decisions only toward the end of this year, when the expiry deadline  — and the start of the European winter — add pressure. Many details still need to be hashed out, and it’s not clear a deal will get done. Developments on the battlefield may also be a factor. Uniper SE, the gas giant that was nationalized by Germany as the energy crisis ruined its business model, has been involved in discussions, according to some of the people. A spokesman for Uniper declined to comment. A German economy ministry spokeswoman said the government was in talks within the European Union. Slovakia is one of the key countries that could benefit from such a deal, and Prime Minister Robert Fico spoke of the possibility last month following a trip to Azerbaijan, without providing details.  “Now, it depends on negotiations between companies such as Russian Gazprom, Azerbaijani, Ukrainian companies, and others to agree on economic and pricing conditions,” he told reporters in May. “If they do, Slovakia could import gas from Azerbaijan, with part of it staying in Slovakia and part passing through to other countries.” A government spokesman declined to comment further. The energy ministry of Austria, another country set to benefit, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Russia still ships around 15 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe a year via Ukraine, mainly to Slovakia and Austria, where Russia is still a dominant supplier. In Austria, Russian gas has covered more than 80% of Austrian consumption for five straight months. Europe also imports Russian LNG by ship, and despite frequent debates about whether it should, it has never sanctioned Russian gas. The European Commission, the executive arm, believes the bloc can withstand the end of Russian transit via Ukraine without any major security risk. Its plan is to rely on alternative suppliers and pursue its ambitious climate strategy, including more renewables and energy savings.  Some member states are less sanguine and fear a replay of the energy crisis. That aligns them with the interests of Ukraine.  “I’m doing everything to find a solution that the Ukrainian gas transportation system will continue to be operational because it’s a big asset and someone should be a customer,” Chernyshov said. “Otherwise it’s loss generating.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

47,Jane Thier,"Productivity theater is the biggest time suck among workers, study finds—'we’re in a system that, unintentionally, is set up to steal our attention'",https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/work-productivity-hours-wasted-state-of-teams-atlassian/,"Responding to incessant Slack pings is wasting 25 billion hours of work a year, a new Atlassian study finds.",2024-06-12T14:00:00Z,"“We don’t want to pontificate or solve the wrong problems; we want to get to the heart of what’s holding teams back,” Annie Dean, outspoken distributed work advocate and leader of software firm Atlassian’s Team Anywhere, recently told Fortune. Right now, the holdup seems to be that actual work isn’t getting done; rather, presenteeism, or just appearing to be working so your boss doesn’t think you’re slacking, has become a growing issue. For a new report, “The State of Teams,” Atlassian surveyed 5,000 knowledge workers across the U.S., Australia, India, Germany, and France—as well as 100 Fortune 500 executives. Dean and her team wanted to understand the pressing issue, amid stalled productivity: Why are teams wasting time, and where is that time going?  Every year, Atlassian found, within the Fortune 500, 25 billion work hours are lost to ineffective collaboration, and the culprits in that productivity drain are the same ones behind Americans’ generally declining attention spans—too many screens, updates, and distractions perfectly designed to waste time. “When I say, ‘why are teams wasting time?’ I’m not saying it’s intentional,” Dean said. “I’m saying we’re in a system that, unintentionally, is set up to steal our attention, drag our efforts to wrong places, and make it harder to get work done. We want to free workers and leaders from that reality.” Workers and leaders feel the same way. Nearly all (93%) of Fortune 500 executives told the researchers they believe their teams could do their same work in half the time it currently takes them to do it. That comes out to 25 billion hours, across industries, of wasted effort each year, or four hours out of an eight-hour workday. And managers estimate that fewer than 1 in 4 of their teams are doing mission-critical work.  Indeed, 65% of knowledge worker respondents told Atlassian they feel it’s more important for them to react to notifications than to make progress on actual tasks. A similar share said they feel they’re constantly pulled in different directions.  Even worse: 50% of workers said they’ve found themselves doing duplicative work—the same tasks as another team somewhere else in the company—which they often don’t realize until it’s too late. “That really speaks to where we place our efforts, as organizations, and how much notifications waste our time,” Dean said. As for how to solve these problems—as with many workplace issues—it often comes down to commitments on the team level. “It’s really about driving attention towards what matters most, either from a high-level goal perspective, or even as a team,” she said. “We want teams to have permission to focus on what matters most.” To managers’ credit, they’re not intending to stymie progress; odds are, most of them would be disappointed to learn that their workers prioritize responding instantly to Slack or Teams pings over actually doing the job. Nonetheless, as with all workflow details, the onus is on the boss to make priorities clear. “Everyone’s working from different locations, are disrupted by tech, and have incredible numbers of notifications and an impossible amount of meetings,” Dean said. “We need to create more space for people to get thoughtful and strategic about what matters. I think we’re living in a system that doesn’t feel healthy or sustainable right now. It’s obvious that there’s a better way.” The better way, ideally, is clarity and agreement on what matters. “That’s what so much of this is about,” Dean said.  Then there’s the matter of productivity theater, which appears to be the biggest time suck altogether. “Often, when we react to notifications all day long, and just show up to whatever our calendars say is important, it means we’re stuck driving our attention towards things that may not be the highest value.” The best-performing teams, Atlassian found, are those who regularly gut-check on whether they’re working on the right tasks, use their time to make real progress, and make the bulk of their institutional knowledge easy to find and parse. One of the most important changes managers and leaders can make is to be clear on what matters up and down the pipeline—and then reorienting operations and resources around making progress toward those goals. Or, as Dean put it, don’t let Slack or calendar blocks dictate what’s most important to workers.  Rather, execs should maintain a “spirit of experimentation.” Luckily, artificial intelligence, in all its forms, is “the cool kid in town,” Dean said, which makes it a handy on-ramp for new tools that could speed business along—leaving the bulk of time for people to do what they do best. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

48,Christiaan Hetzner,GameStop pockets record $2.1 billion from snap share sale that tanked the stock,https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/gamestop-roaring-kitty-keith-gill-share-sale-stock/,Roaring Kitty’s favorite meme stock walked off with a record $2.1 billion in gross cash.,2024-06-12T14:50:18Z,"GameStop hit the jackpot. Roaring Kitty’s favorite meme stock walked off with a record $2.1 billion in gross cash—even adjusted for inflation, exceeding the amount it raised in two separate share sales in 2021 combined.  And GameStop has 38-year-old social media trader Keith Gill to thank for it.   In anticipation of a looming short squeeze triggered by last week’s definitive return of Roaring Kitty, a soaring stock price gifted the company a perfect opportunity to unload 75 million shares at an average price of $28.50 each on a market all too desperate to get their hands on more.  While it may have ruined Gill’s bid to become the first person to become a billionaire on paper during a livestream, it’s a life preserver for the struggling brick-and-mortar games retailer. Due to the terms of the offering, the loss-making company enjoys widespread discretion to do what it sees fit with the company’s windfall gain—no strings attached.  It was a second major victory for chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen after a court dismissed an unrelated lawsuit hanging over the activist investor’s head. “GameStop intends to use the net proceeds…for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday, a common boilerplate phrase that grants management broad scope. Cohen can thank his lucky stars that Roaring Kitty, alias Keith Gill, reemerged out of the blue three years after the latter celebrated an epic victory over Wall Street hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which got burned speculating on a drop in the price of GameStop shares. Communicating at first entirely through memes, Gill signaled he was back to finish the job on May 13. On June 2, he uploaded to Reddit, where he posts under the account DeepFuckingValue, a screenshot of his E*Trade account showing he had quietly amassed a long position in stocks and options worth over $181 million.  While this may have reduced GameStop to little more than the financial equivalent of a ball of yarn, Cohen seized on Roaring Kitty’s return from retirement to make hay.  Together with a stock sale in May that saw 45 million new shares issued—only days after the cryptic memes were first posted—GameStop padded its accounts with $3 billion in cash.  To put this massive haul into context, its net cash only amounted to roughly $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, and the size of its balance sheet totaled just $2.6 billion. In other words, the company quadrupled its cash pile while more than doubling its assets in the span of just four weeks. Citron is no longer short $GME. It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders. Despite Wedbush setting an $11 target today, we respect the… One of the short-sellers burned by Gill three years ago in 2021 is hedge fund manager Andrew Left. He confirmed just last week he was back to placing bearish bets on the stock, but news that GameStop lined its pockets prompted him to now think twice and watch events unfold from the sidelines. “Citron is no longer short GME,” his firm wrote. “It’s not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders.” Needless to say, the cash infusion is a massive boon for a company that operates over 4,000 stores worldwide but is experiencing a technological shift. GameStop specializes in selling physical copies of video games, but more publishers are considering eliminating the format in favor of licensing them as downloads from the cloud.  Sony and Microsoft, the respective manufacturers of the PlayStation and Xbox, already offer cheaper next-gen consoles that lack optical media drives entirely. France’s Ubisoft, the games publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed and FarCry franchises, says people will need to accept that in the future, they won’t own their games, just like they don’t own their movies anymore now that there’s streaming.  “Gamers are used to—a little bit like DVD—having and owning their games,” Ubisoft exec Phillipe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz earlier this year. “That’s the consumer shift that needs to happen.” If companies like Ubisoft eventually only sell their wares through the cloud, what purpose will GameStop stores still serve?  Fortunately for Cohen, many hard-core gamers still viscerally oppose this trend. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

49,Fortune Editors,BNY’s CEO says staffers need to be in the office ‘more than you want’ and managers? ‘Even more.’,https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/bnys-ceo-says-staffers-need-to-be-in-the-office-more-than-you-want-and-managers-even-more/,"Clients and the company's next generation of staffers are best served by employees and managers working on site, says BNY's CEO.",2024-06-12T14:40:08Z,"On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, co-host Alan Murray sits down with Robin Vince, CEO of BNY, formerly the Bank of New York Mellon, which is the oldest company on the Fortune 500 list. Murray met Vince in his office, where they sat surrounded by memorabilia from the bank’s founder, Alexander Hamilton. Their conversation ranges from why BNY was founded to what the bank does today. They also discussed the ongoing threat of cyber attacks and why Vince believes it’s essential that employees and managers spend more working hours than not in the office. Co-host Michal Lev-Ram joins Murray for the pre-interview chat. Murray and Vince met just before the bank’s 240th anniversary when it announced a major change in branding, going from BNY Mellon to BNY. The change, Vince said in a memo to employees, will “clearly communicate our value proposition across the full breadth of our business platforms — as one BNY.” As part of the rebranding, “BNY Mellon Investment Management and BNY Mellon Wealth Management will be updated to BNY Investments and BNY Wealth, better representing the array of services these businesses provide beyond pure asset management, and Pershing will become BNY Pershing. The company’s legal parent name will remain The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.” Listen to the episode or read the transcript below.  Alan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change. Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I’m Alan Murray, and Michael Lev-Ram, I have a question for you. Michal Lev-Ram: Yes. Murray: The question is what is the oldest company on the Fortune 500 list? Lev-Ram: Oh, my gosh. I have the answer in front of me. So, can I cheat? It makes IBM look really, really young and it makes Fortune look very, very young. Spring chicken. Murray: Two hundred and forty years old. It’s BNY, the bank. Robin Vince is the CEO. We did an interview in his office surrounded by memorabilia from Alexander Hamilton, who actually created the bank. I’m really sorry you weren’t there Michael. It was a fascinating dive into a really important financialinstitution that most people don’t know much about. Lev-Ram: I’m so sorry I wasn’t there. I’m sure it was a fascinating conversation, and I’m especially sorry hearing that I missed out on seeing all sorts of artifacts. But what did you talk about? What’s thecompany got going on today? Murray: Well, it’s it’s interesting. It kind of runs a lot of the plumbing of the global financial system, massive amounts of money, something like $50 trillion in assets. There was a big computer screen on thewall where you could see how many Treasury securities they had traded that day and again, it was measured in the trillions. So a lot of things that you don’t see on a regular basis but are handled by the bank behind the scenes. Lev-Ram: Well, I am looking forward to hearing this conversation. And again, I’m sorry I missed it. I’m sure it was fantastic. And just a note to listeners, this interview was recorded before BNY Mellon changedits name to BNY. [Interview begins.] Murray: Robin Vince Bank of New York Mellon. Thank you so much for being on Leadership Next. Robin Vince: Thanks for having me. It’s great to have you here also in the building. Murray: Well, it’s good to be here. This is an historic place. Bank of New York Mellon has been around for, what, 240 years? Vince: That’s right. We turn 240 this year, in fact. Murray: Oldest financial institution in the United States, started by Alexander Hamilton. I’m not sure everyone knows that. And started probably just a few blocks from where we’re sitting right now, right Vince: That’s right. The vision was born in downtown New York City, down in what is essentially now the Wall Street area. Murray: So in spite of that and by the way, we’re surrounded by documents of your history that sort of highlights some of the key points of that 240 years, including Alexander Hamilton’s ledger right overthere. Vince: That’s right. Murray: So it’s an impressive display. Vince: That was his account. We have President Washington’s account for those two years when this was, in fact, the capital of the United States. We have warrant number one, which is particularly fun. They call it the origin story of the $35 trillion worth of national debt today. Murray: Yeah. So the remarkable thing is that in spite of that incredibly long history that sort of begins with the creation of the republic, Bank of New York Mellon is not that well known by most people. Soexplain what it does and what it is. Vince: Well, we’ve been part of the fabric of the United States and actually the world financial system for a lot of our time. And we started, as you pointed out, right with the birth of the republic. And the first thing really that we did for the republic in those early days, right after the British left New York, (it’s a little bit ironic that I have some British heritage but we’ll skip past that) was we lent the first money to the new nation to help the nation get going. And so that’s why we started. We’ve been involved in helping to enable infrastructure of various kinds. New York City subways, the Erie Canal, all over the course of U.S. history. And then we went global and we’ve been in countries around the world for 50, 60, 70 years in some cases, serving clients around the world for over 100 years. Forty percent of our revenues come from outside the U.S. We now view our business as serving our clients by managing money, moving money, and keeping it safe. And we provide a whole range of financial services to clients under those headings. Murray: But it’s kind of like plumbing, right? I mean, there’s no corner Bank of New York Mellon, you know? I see J.P. Morgan. I see Citi. I don’t see Bank of New York Mellon on my corner. Vince: We’re not a retail bank, if that’s what you mean by corner. But we’re really ever-present in the financial system. We power platforms for our clients that really support the pensions of the world, thesavers of the world, the investors of the world all through the financial system. And so we have $50 trillion or thereabouts of assets under custody and administration. We touch about 20% of all investable assets in the world. So you may not see us on the corner front, but we are probably part of yourfinancial life. Murray: And so who’s your competition? Vince: Well, we have competitors all around the world and different types of competitors depending on the business that we’re in. We have large competitors in the custody business, but we have differentcompetitors in the payments business. We were the first bank in the United States to make real time payments on the new real time payment rails a few years ago. We have a very large software and services platform that supports wealth managers and registered investment advisors all across the United States. We help the U.S. Treasury and the Fed to run the U.S. Treasury system. So we really have different types of competitors in different places according to the business. Murray: So you make your money off of fees and off of interest rate spreads. Vince: Yeah, we are a fairly low-risk balance sheet that is generally focused on making sure we’re supporting our clients’ needs, and fees and net interest income are the two big cylinders in our revenueengine. Murray: Yeah. So talk about technology because we all know we’re in the midst of this remarkable technology revolution. We’ve seen that everyone’s imagination has kind of exploded with the introduction of generative AI and the possibilities. Technology is clearly—I’ve seen it walking around your offices here—at the core of what you do. Vince: Well, it is. It really helps us in everything that we do for our clients. I would describe clients as being what we’re about and really the core focus. But technology gives us this incredible leverage tobe able to help our clients. And we think now of ourselves as a platforms business, essentially a set of software and services that allow our clients to build on top of us, to do everything that they’re doing. Very exciting on the topic of AI, but technology for us is so much more. It is about networks andconnectivity to clients all around the world, and we have the ability to really give insights to our clients about what’s going on in their business and to be able to allow them to leverage the efficiency and scale that we have as a company. Murray: And when you talk about clients, you’re talking mostly about financial and other financial institutions. Vince: Well, we serve nearly all of the top 100 financial institutions in the world, but we also support something like 90% of Fortune 100 companies close to that for all of the largest asset managers inthe world. And indirectly, we support the vast number of Americans and global participants in financial markets who are savers. Sixty percent of Americans have some type of investment in the stock market. They may have it in a 401(k) or they may have it in an IRA or they may have it in their own savings account. But underlying that somewhere is probably a touchpoint to the various different businesses that we have. Murray: Yeah, so with a footprint that large, Bank of New York Mellon has to be central to the safety and soundness of our financial system. Resilience has been a big theme for companies over the course of thelast few years. We’ve seen lots of ups and downs, geopolitical threats that can translate into cyber threats. We’ve had financial uneasiness. Your job is to make sure that the financial system survives through all of that. How do you do it? Vince: Well, you said the most important word, Alan, which is resilience. We view resilience as a commercial attribute for our company, but it really is also table stakes for a large modern-day participantin capital markets. And we had plenty of lessons of that last year. When we look back to 2023, the ups and downs in some of the smaller- and medium-sized banks in the United States that occurred, some of the ups and downs and expectations for interest rates, we had geopolitical events that either startedor were continuing. So there are plenty of things going on in the world and you only get to be 240 years old if you think about what lies around the corner, really being prepared, and recognizing that resilience really matters. Murray: Yeah. So can we talk a little bit about cyber security? Because obviously that’s part of the geopolitical threat. Russia, China, Iran, all sources of cyber threats. New technology is accelerating thepossibility of those threats. I hear people talking about quantum (computing). The day quantum comes, there will be a quantum leap in cyber threats. How do you keep up with the rapid escalation of the threats? Vince: Well, cyber is incredibly important topic for any large company, any government, by the way, and for individuals as well. We talk a lot about phishing and smishing. These things are their own version of acyber online threat. And so everybody needs to pay close attention to making sure that they’re well protected. Now, for our part as a company, of course, we spend a lot of money and devote a lot of attention to making sure that we are being prepared and we’re thinking about what lies ahead and defending against the various different threats that come along. We’re also focused on helpingour clients to do those things because we have the benefit of a scale that allows our clients to be able to rely on us for some of those things. And they find a lot of comfort in the fact that we are trying to think steps ahead on the board for that. Murray: But it’s a race, right? You’ve got to keep ahead of the bad guys and there are a lot of them out there. Vince: I think that’s been true since the days of the first bank robbers that the good guys have to stay ahead of the bad guys. But you’re right. Murray: So give us just some magnitude here. In a normal day, how many cyber attacks are you dealing with? Vince: Well, we’re constantly under attack, as is any large enterprise these days, unfortunately, because we’re being probed for various different gaps. Is there a way that people can come in? And that’s whywe have a large team and a lot of resources that are devoted to making sure that we’re fending off anything that happens like that. But that’s a very standard thing for any Fortune 500 company these days. We may be the oldest Fortune 500 company, but in that we’re all in the same place of having to beprepared. [Music starts.] Murray: I’m here with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, who had the wisdom to sponsor this podcast. Thanks for joining me, Jason. Jason Girzadas: Oh, it’s a pleasure to be with you, Alan. Murray: Jason, the pace of technological change is mind boggling these days and it’s really hard for people and human organizations to keep up with it. So how should CEOs prepare their teams forthis pace of constant change? Girzadas: Well, the impact on the workforces of organizations is profound as it relates to technology. And there’s probably nothing more important for CEOs, no matter what organization they’re leading toreally be thinking about technology’s impact on our workforce. It’s really a function of how do you think about technology in concert with your workforce. We at Deloitte talk about it as the age of technology with your workforce, and really embracing this idea of the co-dependency of technology and workforce. We’re also an environment of a very tight workforce where there’s a scarcity of top talent and an increased pressure on a diversity of top talent. That’s going to be the challenge for organizations to demonstrate to top talent that they can grow and evolve the work that they do. Working with leading technology in a very aligned way. Finally, it’s what top talent really wants in an organization is to learn and grow and to be part of an organization that’s supportive of them actually embedding technology in theirwork. Murray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next. Girzadas: Thank you. [Music ends.] Murray: So let’s talk a little bit about you. How did you get here? How did you end up at the top of this this huge company? How many employees do you have, by the way? Vince: We have about 50,000. Murray: So this is a huge global operation. What was your path? Did you wake up one day and say, I want to run the biggest financial institution in the United States or did it wind more than that? Vince: Of course it was more than that. I’m very lucky with my past. I grew up in a different institution, but through my time in that… Murray: Goldman Sachs, right? Vince: That’s right. That’s right. I joined right out of school and that proved to be a really terrific set of experiences for me. And I say set of experiences because I had the good fortune to work under leaders who really moved me around the company and gave me different exposures to things. I had the opportunity to work in different places. I had the opportunity to work in many of the different parts of the company. I grew up on the trading side, had a set of experiences there, and then I had the opportunity to work in risk and in Treasury, help participate in sort of a regional view of the company. And these experiences really did help me and they created this sort of cumulative set of knowledge, tests, financial crisis, going through, I remember the Russian default, I remember Long Term Capital Management, I remember September 11th. Each one of these things were sort of their own crucibles of learning, if you will, and then working with the people in that institution prepared me very well. And one day I had the opportunity to come here. And that’s really been just a tremendous opportunity to put a lot of that and those skills to work. Murray: Those crises you’re talking about seem to come faster, more frequently, more diverse in origin and having the right culture to deal with that, when you talk about resilience, we know culture is atthe core of it. How do you think about culture and what is the culture of Bank of New York Mellon? Vince: People often ask me, What is your focus on strategy? How do you think about the importance of it? And actually my answer to that is to sort of borrow the quote from another: culture really does eatstrategy for breakfast. And I’ll add to that by saying execution eats strategy for lunch, because without people and without the right alignment and without the right sense of purpose around what we’re doing and without a sense of we’re really trying to nurture a learning environment and an environment which is really focused on being high performing, no company can succeed. And that’s one of the things that I’ve really loved about BNY Mellon. We have a culture that’s incredibly client-centric and that holds the firm also in high regard. People cherish your history. We’ve got this 240 years of having really powered financial markets and people take a lot of pride in that. And so when we’re out on campus recruiting people, when we’re talking to our people about what we do and why it matters in the world, you talked about the scale and breadth that we had, and I’ve illustrated it with some numbers, but at the very heart it’s people coming here wanting to be part of the financial system, part of improving things, helping make things work better for individuals and companies all around the world. And there’s a lot of culture in that. Murray: There’s a great culture experiment going on here in downtown Manhattan as we speak. We still haven’t completely recovered from the pandemic and the effects of that and distributed work. Your former employer just down the road, Goldman Sachs, has been saying, by God, we want you in the office every day. Right across the street from them, American Express, another financial company, is saying it doesn’t have to be every day. We could probably get by two or three days a week. Where do you fall in the great debate about office work? How often if you work at Bank of New York Mellon in the office, how often do you have to be in? Vince: So the short answer to the question is, more days than you’re not. But let’s just step back for a second and remember, what are we trying to achieve? I would like our people to be here to be able to really serve our clients. It’s hard sometimes to fully serve clients when you’re actually not in the office because you may not be out with your clients as much as you otherwise would. What else are we asking our people to do? We’re asking them to pay it forward for the next generation. We’ve hired the largestanalyst class of new incoming analysts that we’ve ever had as a company, which is double what it was the year before. And that was double what it was the year before that. We can’t have all of these new summer analysts close to 2,000 and new full time analysts close to 2,000 joining us and then not have people to learn from, not to have those hallway conversations. I want them to be able to come in here, observe and absorb the culture. And in order to do that, we need to have a lot of people here. So that’s what we’ve asked our people to do. Be here more than you aren’t. And for people who have management responsibilities, be here even more. Murray: Yeah. Robin, these days, what keeps you up at night? What worries you about your ability to keep this great institution going for another 240 years? Vince: Staying humble and staying a bit paranoid was one of the things that I learned as I was growing up is a very healthy state of mind for a CEO to have. So never being comfortable and always worrying a little bit about what might lie around the corner. Now, what are we doing about that? We are obsessively focused on our clients. We are really making sure that we’re running our company in a great way and never losing sight of the importance of culture. Now, in order to do all of those things, how do we put it out in the world? Yeah, we’re thinking around the corners. Will the Fed raise rates? Will the Fed cut rates? Will the Fed stay the same? We’re not pinning all of the company on one of those outcomes. We’re being prepared for the different eventualities. The same thing’s true on cyber. The same thing’s true for the geopolitics of the world. You’ve got to be prepared for how the world can zig and zag, and that is ultimately… Murray: I heard someone say recently that the single point forecast is dead. Anybody who runs their business based on a single point forecast of the future is ignoring the realities of our time. Vince: It’s risky and one might be right, but it’s very unlikely that you’re going to carry on being right, certainly over hundreds of years. Murray: Yeah. And what excites you most about the next 10 years? What do you see in the future of this business that really gets you going? Vince: Well, I’ll say two things that we’re really focused on as a company. One, for us, it’s that opportunity to be platforms, rentable scale, insights into markets, capabilities that our clients can then go build their businesses on. There are so many things that we take for granted today that are essentially platforms that we all use every day. That maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago, if you’re a company, you might have done for yourself. And so having those market leading positions across payments, across custody, across wealth assets, across collateral, across the U.S. Treasury market, across various forms of markets, these are all very real scale things where we are potentially the largest in many cases at what we do, and that allows clients to be able to borrow our scale and to be able to get wrapped in our technology and our capabilities so they can focus on what they really want to be doing and what makes them really great. Murray: There’s obviously an enormous amount of pressure that goes with this job that you have. What do you do to unwind? What do you do to relax? What let you breathe? Vince: I heard Jamie Dimon say something the other day which actually really resonates with me, which is he sort of has two focus areas. One is his company and the other one is his family. I’m very much likethat. It was once said, and I think this is not a bad expression, that you can have it all. You just can’t have it all at the same time. And I think that’s right for me and so I’ve really devoted myself to saying this is an incredible franchise. I want to serve our clients and serve our people as well. And at the same time, equally, maybe more importantly for me, is my family. And those are the two things that I do. There are plenty of other things that I enjoy, but those are the two things I deliberately make time for. Murray: Robin, what’s the biggest challenge that workers today are facing? Vince: Well, there’s a lot of anxiety that I recognize can exist for workers. There’s a lot that’s going on around the world. AI is, of course, an ever-present thing. I like to think about this is the responsibility of an employer to make sure that we’re really helping our employees to navigate. We made every employee in our company a shareholder about a year ago by giving them stock in BNY Mellon because they’re part of our journey. We’ve been leaning into benefits. We’ve been created new mental health benefits for all of our employees as well, because it’s that essence of culture to bring your people along on the journey. Murray: Great institution, big job. Thank you very much for taking the time to be with me on Leadership Next. Vince: Great to be with you and thank you for being with us.

50,"The Associated Press, Stephen Whyno","Canadian youth have put hockey on thin ice: As participation declines, the future on the beloved pastime is precarious",https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/canada-youth-hockey-pastime-participation-decline-nhl/,Hockey Canada reported a 35% drop in youth hockey participation compared to 13 years ago.,2024-06-11T17:14:02Z,"BRAMPTON, Ontario (AP) — All four ice rinks at Susan Fennell Sportsplex are full of action on this winter Saturday morning, the air filled with the sound of hockey skates grinding through ice and pucks clanging off the glass. The scene is as familiar as the sunrise in countless rinks across Canada. Hockey remains a beloved pastime, a source of pride and joy and something that has knitted the vast nation together for more than 150 years. Behind the scenes of the goals and celebrations is an alarming trend: Youth hockey participation in the cradle of the sport has decreased by nearly a third over the past decade and a half, a decline that began well before the pandemic from a peak of over half a million kids taking part as recently as 2010. Because of growing costs for everything from equipment and ice time to specialized coaching and travel programs, families are choosing other sports like soccer and basketball over hockey. There are concerns about the future of grassroots hockey in the country that has nourished it into the popular, vibrant sport that is seeing growth elsewhere, including the United States. “It does sadden me,” said Alex Klimsiak, who coaches two teams in Brampton as his way to giving back to the game he still plays recreationally in suburban Toronto at the age of 44. “Enrollment’s probably been declining for the last five, six years. Definitely before the pandemic you could see it. A pandemic just put a magnifying glass and escalated it.” In 2022, about two months after Canada celebrated what was then its 18th world junior hockey championship, the CEO of hockey equipment giant Bauer, Ed Kinnaly, declared: “The number of kids getting involved in hockey in Canada is spiraling downward … but nobody’s talking about that.” At the time, Hockey Canada reported 340,365 youths younger than 18 participating in the sport, a 35% drop from 523,785 just 13 years earlier. That number slightly rebounded in 2023 to 360,031, but is still some 15% below pre-pandemic levels even while soccer and tennis numbers in Canada have already recovered. “I’m concerned but I’m not panicked,” Kinnaly told The Associated Press earlier this year. “I’m concerned obviously at what the numbers say. I’m not panicked because I do believe that the sport is evolving. I do think the right people — the National Hockey League, USA Hockey, Hockey Canada, private corporations — are all starting to have the honest dialogue with each other, which is, A, we’ve got to stop talking about what’s wrong and, B, we’ve got to start investing in change for the sake of the sport.” Few things are more closely associated with Canada than hockey, a place where kids and adults alike look forward to winter and lakes and ponds freezing over so they can lace up their skates, push a net out and play some shinny. When Canada faced the U.S. in the 2010 Olympic final on home ice in Vancouver, half the country’s total population watched Sidney Crosby score the “golden goal,” etched into national lore. Millions are watching Edmonton this spring as the Oilers try to end the nation’s 31-year Stanley Cup championship drought. Yet the sport may no longer be the go-to for kids in Canada. According to the Canadian Youth Sports Report released last summer by Solutions Research Group, soccer is the top choice at 16%, followed by swimming, hockey and basketball. Raw participation numbers for the sports are not comparable given differences in registration requirements across various governing bodies. Parents cited financial issues as their top concern (58%), followed by family care and youth mental health, including bullying. There are some concerns, too, that the time needed for practices and drills even at the lower levels of competitive hockey is part of the problem. “It definitely is a big commitment,” said Priyanka Kwatra, whose 10-year-old son Shawn has developed a love for the sport and plays in suburban Toronto. “It’s a very time-consuming sort of sport.” Time-consuming in large part because of the limited availability of ice that pushes practices and games to very early in the morning or late at night. Many youth programs train nine months or more per year, on the ice three to five times a week along with off-ice workouts. When her husband, Amit, first looked at equipment for Shawn, the $1,000 price tag was a shock. Add to that limits on available ice for practices or for fun and games and basketball or soccer suddenly seem easier. “Getting someone into hockey, it’s not as simple as getting someone into soccer where you just need a soccer ball,” Amit Kwatra said. “Hockey, the amount of gear that’s required in order to kind of get the game started is a lot, and I think that is the biggest barrier for a lot of people that initiate their kids into hockey.” Other sports can also feel like a safer choice than hockey with its speed, hits and sharp skates. Gianfranco Talarico is the founder of Daredevil Hockey, which has been making cut-proof gear for more than a decade. He said his company’s feedback and surveys have shown safety and cost are the biggest things hindering a more rapid growth of the sport. “It’s so intertwined in the fabric of Canadians,” he said. “If we don’t collectively focus on making hockey a safer sport, the potential brand equity of hockey in general will start to diminish.” During All-Star Weekend in Toronto, the NHL put on a youth event in nearby York. With daughter Sharon, Priyanka and Amit watched their son on the ice, he and more than 100 other young players all in their first set of gear provided by Bauer as part of NHL/NHLPA First Shift, one of many learn-to-play efforts intended to keep hockey in Canada’s bloodlines. “It’s a low-cost entry point, and then it obviously is able to accelerate growth because it provides opportunity,” said Matt Herr, a former NHL player who is now the league’s senior director of youth hockey and industry growth. “Especially in Canada, we’re competing now where it used to be the pastime. … it was everybody’s first choice, and now there’s all these different choices and we’ve got to make sure we’re still everybody’s first choice.” Herr and others know the equipment costs are potentially becoming a barrier. The quality of sticks, helmets and pads has increased sharply thanks to technological advances, but with that comes higher pricing — and with that comes the risk of leaving out lower-income families eager to try hockey, especially with higher levels of the sport running nearly year-round. Rachael Bishop for her 2017 honors thesis at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, found a massive gap between the household incomes of families in hockey compared with other sports, an indication of the means necessary to afford it. “I do think it’s more so probably a factor of cost, and we’re seeing it become prohibitively expensive now,” Bishop told The AP. “You see the professionalization of hockey: It’s a full-year sport now: You’ve got to join summer leagues, you want to get all the best equipment. Then there’s always like power-skating lessons, summer camps, so I think a lot of it is cost more so than anything.” Klimsiak, the Brampton coach, estimated that the cost of being on a competitive team — the ones that travel to tournaments and have multiple set practice times as opposed to recreational teams — starts at $4,000, with some teams charging $10,000 or more. He said some Toronto hockey organizations are combining resources because there aren’t enough players to go around. “The cost of the game has gone up,” said Klimsiak, who has three sons playing, one on his team, which he has trouble finding goaltenders for. “Referee costs have gone up. It’s tough. It’s proportional. It’s like cost of living, so everything’s gone up and now unfortunately the parents have to pay more.” Cost is something University of Toronto professor Simon Darnell is all too aware of. The parent of a 9-year-old playing competitive hockey, the expert in sports culture and sociology calls costs one of the “exclusionary practices in hockey that go back a long time,” along with the culture of winning and the obsession over climbing up to the next team. Darnell, acknowledging the willingness to shell out money for ice and other expenses, also understands the early-morning, nearly year-round aspect of hockey is one of factors keeping some out. “It’s like if you don’t want to participate in hockey on those terms, then there isn’t as much space for you I think as there should be,” Darnell said. “It’s if you don’t want to play by those rules, then there isn’t space for you and then you go and play a different sport.” A further concern: Are there enough ice rinks to accommodate hockey as a source of fun and character-building for children? Canada’s population, now nearly 40 million, has doubled in 50 years, and the International Ice Hockey Federation reports there are still just 2,860 indoor ice rinks across the sprawling country. Renting ice can cost hundreds of dollars just for 1-2 hours. Kinnaly pointed to a 2019 Parks and Recreation Ontario plan to invest $2 billion over the next two decades on 45 new soccer fields, 30 basketball courts, 18 indoor pools and a single hockey rink as further cause for concern “The number of rinks that are in disrepair or have closed further compresses the availability of ice time,” Kinnaly said. “If there aren’t places for people to play, it’s going to continue to be a headwind, a real challenge.” Programs like First Shift and Scotiabank’s Hockey For All are among the steps being taken to stop the slide. Kinnaly said Bauer’s program has been “immensely successful” at not only getting kids into hockey but keeping them, with a retention rate around 60%, and has discussed ways of introducing new Canadians to the game like equipment being part of the welcome package upon signing up for a checking account. But there are still systemic issues, from crumbling infastruture and a lack of new rinks to inflationary pressure on pricing. The woes are not being seen at the NHL level, where revenue continues to rise and fan interest is growing. In the U.S., youth hockey participation has slowly grown to nearly 400,000 registered players, surpassing Canada in 2021. Instead, the existential crisis for the home of hockey exists at places like the Brampton rink, where the players and fans of tomorrow are developed. There are encouraging signs, such as hockey still being the preferred sports for First Nations youth and nearly 40% of First Shift participants being girls as the women’s game gets more attention — but the overall trend has presented a painful question that must be answered. “I don’t think hockey can rest on its position in a way that it used to, and there’s part of me that’s OK with that,” said Darnell, the Toronto professor. “I think it makes sense if we’re going to invest in hockey in Canada as somehow representative of Canadian culture that we actually need to think about what does Canadian culture look like and is it reflected in hockey? Because right now it’s not.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The Breakfast Club lottery club opted for a cash lump sum of $305 million after taxes, Michigan Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli told reporters outside the Food Castle convenience store in Grand Blanc Township near Flint, where the winning ticket was sold. The winning numbers drawn were: 12, 21, 42, 44, 49 and red Powerball: 1. Speaking on behalf of The Breakfast Club, member and attorney Mark Harder said the middle-aged couple has “been elated and overwhelmed, thrilled and nervous” since realizing their ticket was the winner. “They’ve gone from shock and sleepless nights to giving careful thought as to how this once-in-a-lifetime event will transform their lives,” Harder said. “The morning after the drawing, we heard through the news that the winning ticket had been sold here,” Harder said. “(The husband) looked up the ticket numbers on his phone, and he was so stunned he dropped his phone.” In a statement, the couple, whose names were not revealed Tuesday, said the prize will positively affect their family for generations to come. “Up until now, we’ve led a comfortable life and anticipated retiring someday,” according to the statement read by Harder. “Now, we’re not financially bound to any specific timetable. The world and our opportunities have opened up in some incredible ways.” Harder told reporters that the husband plans to continue working for a while longer. The couple also expect to travel more and possibly buy property in Florida when Michigan winters “get to be a bit too much.” They also plan to share the winnings with their immediate family and donate to charities, Harder added. He didn’t indicate what he would do with his own winnings. Food Castle will receive $50,000 in commission for selling the winning ticket. The store’s owners said they will share the entire amount with their employees and donate to food pantries and other charities. The winning numbers for a $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot were drawn in April in Oregon. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

52,Paolo Confino,Norway just loosened China’s stranglehold on rare minerals critical to the global economy—and it’s a huge win for Europe and the U.S.,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/norway-rare-earth-elements-mining-china-us-trade-war-energy-independence/,"China currently processes 90% of the world’s rare elements, breaking that dominance is a top priority for Europe and the U.S.",2024-06-11T21:25:12Z,"Norway just struck a gold mine. Well, a rare mineral mine.  The Norwegian mining company, Rare Earths Norway, just uncovered the largest deposit of rare earth elements in Europe. The discovery has major implications not just for the company, which is certainly poised for a windfall, but for global geopolitics.  Rare Earths Norway found the deposit in the Fen Carbonatite Complex located in the southern tip of the country, according to a press release. These rare elements, which are a family of 17 metals, are used in a host of consumer electronics like smartphones and flat-screen TVs. They’re also critical to the green-energy transition because they are key components in products like electric vehicles and wind turbines. But, as the name suggests, they are in short supply around the world. By dint of geography or luck, the vast majority of rare earth elements are found and extracted in China, giving the world’s second largest economy extraordinary influence in determining their supply and demand across the world. Currently, China accounts for 70% of the extraction of these elements from the ground and 90% of their processing, according to research from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, an independent energy research institute. Norway’s discovery would finally make Europe a player in the industry.  “It is important to state that there is absolutely no extraction of rare earth elements in Europe today,” Rare Earths Norway CEO Alf Reistad told CNBC. Rare Earths Norway’s discovery comes at a time when Europe and the U.S. have had tense trade relations with China. Many of those tensions are wrapped up in national-security issues as well. Europe is wary of China, given its allyship with Russia, which has been largely ostracized on the continent, certainly by members of the European Union. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China are engaged in what one economist called a “forever” trade war. The U.S. has accused China of intentionally oversupplying global markets with certain products, like electric vehicles. The concern is that because China has cornered the market on rare elements it could also manipulate that market by doing the opposite and purposefully withholding supply to drive up prices—something it has threatened to do, but hasn’t yet pulled the trigger on.  Norway has already made some strides in trying to chip away at Europe’s dependence on China to get access to the materials. In January, the Norwegian parliament voted 80–20 to allow offshore, deep-sea mining of rare minerals in remote waters to the north of the country. Norway, which is already a major producer of oil and natural gas, would become the first country to allow its seabed to be mined for rare minerals. Current plans would see Norway mine 108,000 square miles, an area roughly the size of Colorado. The newly discovered deposit only strengthens Europe’s hand against rivals like China.  Though the fact that these reserves were located in China was due to chance, China’s ability to make the most of them and use them as a strategic geopolitical tool—even a cudgel—was intentional. Through years of domestic industrial policy, China secured patents in the technology needed to extract the rare elements, directing huge amounts of government resources toward the project, and investing heavily in extracting ore from deposits across the globe.  Once its dominance was established, the Chinese government sought to protect it. Last year, China banned the export of technology used to extract gallium and germanium, two elements used in chip manufacturing. China’s strong market position was also favored by lax labor standards. “This dominance has been achieved through decades of state investment, export controls, cheap labor, and low environmental standards,” the Oxford Institute researchers wrote. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

53,Sasha Rogelberg,Mold colonies and liquid-flooded air purifiers: CVS sourced medication from tainted factories—and it has twice the amount of recalls on store-brand drugs than competitors,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/cvs-recalls-generic-drugs/,Mold colonies and liquid-flooded air purifiers: CVS sourced medication from tainted factories—and it has twice the amount of recalls on store-brand drugs than competitors,2024-06-11T21:26:29Z,"Pharmacy chain CVS has over 2,000 store-brand health and wellness items, and it appears to have cut corners to cheaply source some of those products at the expense of its customers, according to a new report from Bloomberg. CVS has twice the recalls on generic, over-the-counter drugs as competitor Walgreens, found the Bloomberg investigation, which analyzed data from the Food and Drug Administration. In the past decade, CVS had 133 recalls of generic-brand over-the-counter drugs compared to 70 from Walgreens and 51 from Walmart.  The prevalence of the chain’s recalls are linked with supplying drugs from tainted factories, the investigation concludes. FDA inspectors found bacteria-contaminated water in one now-defunct Florida factory producing fruit-flavored children’s medication for fever, allergies, and pain. In January, FDA investigators found standing liquid inside an air purifier, which later developed colonies of mold, at CVS’s generic Allegra allergy medication producer in India. CVS has outsourced products from factories in order to save money, per Bloomberg, including from 15 manufacturers in the last 10 years that had previous problems with producing medications. Because CVS is a “private-label distributor” of its own-brand drugs, it can skirt FDA requirements to approve or reject the medications. Instead, the onus is on the manufacturer to approve the products. According to Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, when companies are asked to choose between quality and price, they often veer toward cheap means of sourcing items. “The best way to make a low-price product is to skimp on quality and that’s what we’re seeing over and over and over again,” he told Bloomberg. A CVS spokesperson told Fortune its recalled store-brand over-the-counter products make up fewer than 1% of the FDA’s drug recalls in the past 10 years. It also completes an average of 350 daily tests to assess the quality and safety of its products, the person said. “CVS Pharmacy’s store brands are designed to maximize quality and safety, work as intended, comply with regulations, and satisfy customers,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We work with manufacturers and regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, to ensure all quality and safety standards are met or exceeded.” Beyond its recall rate, CVS, which owns the health insurer Aetna, has struggled to bring in revenue due to high medical costs in the insurance industry as patients return to hospitals for more intensive surgeries after the pandemic. In May, the company adjusted its 2024 earnings to $7 per share, compared to its previous forecast of $8.30 per share. Though CVS has recorded more recalls compared to its retail competitors, growing recalls are an industry-wide issue. Pharmaceutical recalls skyrocketed to 517 events in 2023 compared to 363 the year before, a 42.4% increase, according to Sedgwick’s State of the Nation 2024 Product Safety and Recall report. However, while 2023 had the highest number of pharmaceutical recalls in a decade, those recalls affected far fewer products than past years.  Most of those recalls are due to poor temperature control, especially for over-the-counter medications, followed by failed specifications or failure to meet certain standards, and concerns over sterility, particularly for eye drops. Of the 131 pharmaceutical recall events that took place in 2023’s fourth quarter, 62 companies were impacted. The increase in tainted generic-brand drugs led the U.S. Department of Defense to tap independent lab Valisure to test dozens of medications for dangerous chemicals in August 2023. The U.S. has increasingly relied on factories overseas, particularly in India and China, to produce generic medication, and concerns over the quality of non-brand name products have risen amid a widespread drug shortage crisis that has made it increasingly important to produce and supply effective medication. “Supply chains have become more diverse at the same time as medicines have become more complex,” Sedgwick’s report said. But U.S. authorities have not always kept a close enough eye on overseas factories to ensure they deliver safe products,  former FDA inspector Massoud Motamed warned. He told NBC News in 2019 that the FDA failed to heed his warning that two factories in India and China had systemic issues impacting the production of blood pressure medication valsartan. Later, it was revealed the drug was contaminated with a substance also found in rocket fuel production. “Growing up, we had this saying, ‘You get what you pay for,'” Motamed said. “We have that belief for everything except pharmaceuticals. If we want to drive competition and drive the price down, it comes at the cost of quality.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

54,Alena Botros,"The housing market’s pivotal spring selling season is coming to an end—not with a bang, but with a whimper",https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/housing-market-outlook-spring-selling-season-home-sales-listings/,Capital Economics says “mortgage demand and sales activity won’t recover until rates fall meaningfully below 7%.” The research firm only expects that to happen later this year.,2024-06-10T17:54:25Z,"This year’s spring selling season wasn’t a typical one, and while it seems to have been better than last year’s, there was an air of melancholy surrounding it.  As the season winds down, mortgage applications, pending home sales, existing home sales, and listings for the last few months have all generally reflected that sentiment.  It’s another reminder that buying and selling homes hasn’t been the same since the pandemic. It’s hard to sell your home if your mortgage rate is much lower than the current rate. And it’s hard to buy when the salary needed for a starter home has almost doubled and the cost of owning a home is the highest on record.  Mortgage applications for home purchases dropped 3.3% in May from the previous month, which saw a 2.3% dip, according to Capital Economics, a research firm. The second consecutive monthly fall showed March’s uptick was short-lived. Meanwhile, May applications are only 6.5% higher than they were in October last year, when they hit a 28-year low. If you remember, mortgage rates hit a more than two-decade high of just above 8% last October. They’ve come down to the 7% range, or 6.99% according to Freddie Mac’s weekly reading; daily mortgage rates are higher.  “The fall in May happened despite mortgage rates easing to 7.07% last month, from 7.17%, supporting our view that mortgage demand and sales activity won’t recover until rates fall meaningfully below 7%,” Capital Economics’ economist Thomas Ryan wrote last week, suggesting June might not be any better. “We only expect that to happen later in the year.” Refinancing activity is near all-time lows, too, because the average rate of all outstanding mortgages is about 4% since so many people either purchased during the pandemic, when mortgage rates were historically low, or refinanced.  Realtor.com’s recently released monthly housing analysis found there were more homes for sale on a typical day in May compared with the same time last year, but there’s still fewer homes for sale than what was typical from 2017 to 2019; it was a similar story in April and March. Separate data shows pending home sales plummeted 7.7% in April on a monthly basis and 7.4% on an annual basis; contract signings fell in all regions compared to the month before and a year earlier. And existing home sales dropped 1.9% in April month over month and year over year. In March, existing home sales fell 4.3% on a monthly basis and 3.7% on an annual basis. All the while, home prices continued to rise; they hit their ninth all-time high within the past year in March.  Combining the latest mortgage applications data with the weak April pending home sales number puts existing home sales in May on course to dip below an annualized rate of 4 million, well below the average from the past 10 years of around 5.2 million, Ryan wrote, and his team isn’t seeing a recovery until the end of next year, at which point it’ll be a muted one. For activity to really rise, mortgage rates have to fall, and the only hope for mortgage rates is interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.  “Home sales are stuck because interest rates have not made any major moves,” National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said, alongside a prior existing home sales release. The consumer price index, an inflation measure, for May is scheduled to be released Wednesday morning, ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. It seems as though the Fed will leave rates unchanged. So for now, it’s hard to imagine mortgage rates falling meaningfully and actually staying there, rather than momentary dips or fluctuations.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

55,Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez,Toyota’s sterling reputation just took a $15 billion hit after the car giant was found falsifying safety tests,https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/toyota-reputation-falsifying-safety-tests-crown-corolla-yaris-cars/,Shares for the world’s largest carmaker fell more than 5% last week.,2024-06-10T20:12:07Z,"Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, saw its market value plummet last week after Japan’s Transport Ministry found it had falsified and mishandled data for safety certification tests. The scandal took a $15.6 billion bite out of the company’s market cap as its shares fell by more than 5.4% last week, CNBC reported. Toyota’s Nasdaq-listed shares were up about 1% as of Monday afternoon.  Through an internal investigation prompted by a regulator mandate, Toyota found it had not performed safety tests as certification required in five cases related to vehicles including the Crown, Corolla, and the Yaris Cross. In one case involving the Lexus RX, the company had submitted falsified data to meet safety standards and submitted it for certification. Although the company maintained the vehicles affected by the scandal were safe to drive, Toyota’s chairman Akio Toyoda apologized in a press conference last week. “As the person responsible for the Toyota Group, I would like to extend my sincere apologies to our customers, car enthusiasts, and all stakeholders for this issue,” he said.  Toyota said it would suspend production of three models—the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio, and Yaris Cross—based on the findings from its investigation. The company sold more than 11 million total vehicles worldwide last year.  Toyota rivals Honda, Mazda, and Suzuki also admitted to falsifying data related to safety certification tests in what amounted to a week of setbacks for Japanese automakers. Mazda, which is Japan’s second-largest automaker, suspended production of the Roadster RF and Mazda 2, while company shares sank more than 7% last week, resulting in a $500 million hit to its market cap, CNBC reported. The safety scandal involving several Japanese automakers risks damaging the stellar reputation that companies such as Toyota and Nissan have cultivated, especially in North America, the companies’ biggest market.  Japan’s transport ministry earlier this year ordered 90 car manufacturers to reexamine how they test their vehicles after a Toyota affiliate was found to have falsified data related to safety for decades. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

56,"Haleluya Hadero, The Associated Press","More than 15,000 Amazon drivers accuse the e-commerce giant of shorting them on pay and incurring 'huge expenses'",https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/amazon-drivers-pay-arbitration-illinois-massachusetts-california/,"Thousands of Amazon Flex drivers in California, Illinois, and Massachusetts have submitted arbitration claims alleging pay violations.",2024-06-11T22:02:54Z,"Thousands of delivery drivers filed legal claims against Amazon on Tuesday, alleging the company’s classification of them as independent contractors instead of employees has led to unpaid wages and other financial losses. Two law firms spearheading the action said about 15,860 Amazon Flex drivers have submitted arbitration claims with the American Arbitration Association, where 453 similar cases are already being litigated. Amazon’s Flex program, which was founded in 2015, signs up drivers to deliver packages with their own cars and a special app. The company pitches the work as a flexible, part-time opportunity that allows people to earn extra income during the hours they choose. Most drivers earn $18-25 per hour, according to Amazon, though how much they get paid can depend on other factors, such as their location and how long it takes to complete deliveries. The arbitration claims submitted Tuesday were made by drivers in California, Illinois and Massachusetts, all of which have rules that limit the amount of control companies can exert over independent contractors. The claims, collected over a span of four years by attorneys Joseph Sellers and Steven Tindall, maintain the drivers should be classified as Amazon employees instead of independent contractors, based on current laws in the three states. That change would allow Flex drivers to collect unpaid wages because Amazon only pays them for a pre-determined number of hours regardless of how long it takes to complete deliveries, according to the lawyers. It would also allow Flex drivers to receive overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week and get reimbursements for work-related expenses, such as gas costs and vehicle wear and tear. Gas and other vehicle costs are a “huge expense to our clients,” Tindall said during an interview. He also said one client represented in the claims worked 7-day weeks making deliveries for Amazon during a holiday period and never was paid overtime. In a prepared statement, Amazon spokesperson Branden Baribeau touted the benefits of the Flex program, saying it gives “individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay.” “We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we’re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day,” Baribeau said. Tindall and Sellers say they have so far succeeded in seven of the eight arbitration claims against Amazon they took to trial. The drivers they represented in those cases were awarded an average of $9,000 in damages. Amazon’s business model for its driving workforce – made up of independent contractors and third-party businesses that allow the company to avoid unionization – faces scrutiny and challenges from different corners. A bipartisan group of more than 30 U.S. senators sent Amazon CEO Andy Jassy a letter last week asking for more information on the company’s relationship with the thousands of independent businesses that make millions of deliveries each day as part of Amazon’s Delivery Service Partners program. In March, the Wisconsin Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that declared Flex drivers to be employees – a decision that would allow them to be part of the state’s unemployment insurance system and entitled to jobless pay if they are laid off. The Teamsters union, which is seeking to organize Amazon’s drivers, also filed a complaint at the National Labor Relations Board last year challenging how the company classifies some of its drivers. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

57,Will Daniel,China has a ‘near monopoly’ on many critical minerals. JPMorgan says it could be the ‘next battleground’ with the U.S.,https://fortune.com/2024/06/10/china-near-monopoly-many-critical-minerals-jpmorgan-says-next-battleground-usa/,The U.S. is 100% reliant on imports for 12 minerals that are key to the production of semiconductors and other high-tech products.,2024-06-10T19:19:52Z,"China has a “near monopoly” on the mining of many raw materials that are critical for the production of semiconductors and other technologies, JPMorgan said Monday, highlighting the importance of key minerals in the escalating U.S.-China trade war. President Biden upped the ante in the ongoing spat with China last month when he targeted Chinese products including solar cells, EVs, batteries, steel, aluminum, medical equipment, and more with a raft of new tariffs. “The Biden administration’s latest tariff announcement on $18 billion of Chinese imports has elevated the debate on whether China’s dominance in the critical minerals supply chain will emerge as the latest battleground for U.S.-China strategic competition,” wrote JPMorgan’s executive director of strategic research, Amy Ho, and global head of research, Joyce Chang, in a note to clients. In 2022, China produced 68% of the world’s rare earth minerals, which are used for things like magnets and batteries, and 70% of its graphite, which is used in lubricants, electric motors, and even nuclear reactors. However, China’s real dominance lies in its mineral processing capabilities, according to JPMorgan. China processed 100% of the world’s graphite supply in 2022, 90% of rare earths, and 74% of cobalt (another critical mineral for batteries). “Increasing dependence on critical minerals, which are key inputs to semiconductors, EVs, military weapons etc., has raised concerns that China could use its dominance in this supply chain to retaliate against U.S. industrial policy,” Ho and Chang warned. The U.S. and China’s tit-for-tat trade war began in 2018, when then-President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and commodities, including solar panels and steel, citing the country’s intellectual property (IP) theft and unfair trade practices. Since then, tensions between the world’s two largest superpowers have only escalated, with a high-stakes battle over semiconductor IP and manufacturing taking center stage amid the AI boom.  Of the minerals that the U.S. Geological Survey has identified as critical to the U.S. economy and national security, the U.S. was 100% reliant on imports for 12 of them.  Top source: ChinaApplications: Semiconductors Top source: Germany Applications: Research and development Top source: Mexico Applications: Manufacturing of fuel, foams, refrigerants, and more Top source: Japan Applications: Integrated circuits and optical devices Top source: China Applications: Lubricants, batteries, and fuel cells Top source: South Korea Applications: Liquid crystal display screens Top source: Gabon Applications: Manufacturing of steel and batteries Top source: Brazil Applications: Manufacturing of superalloys Top source: China Applications: Electronics research and development Top source: Japan Applications: Manufacturing of alloys, ceramics, and fuel cells Top source: China Applications: Manufacturing of electronic components, capacitors, and superalloys Top source: China Applications: Manufacturing of ceramics and lasers China is the top source for five out of 12 of these critical minerals, and the second or third top source for an additional three: Fluorspar, Galium, and Scandium. But China isn’t the only nation the U.S. relies on for key minerals. Mexico, Japan, and Korea are among the other top sources.  The U.S. relies on imports for 50% or more of its supply of an additional 29 minerals beyond the dozen listed above. This includes a 90% plus net import reliance for titanium, 14 rare earths, and bismuth. With the U.S.-China trade war heating up, minerals could prove an exploitable weak point for Beijing. In a worst-case scenario where China increases export restrictions for key minerals or implements a full ban, the electronics, oil refining, defense, and EV sectors would be especially at risk, JPMorgan’s Ho and Chang noted. Still, for now, JPMorgan’s strategists don’t foresee a serious mineral turf war taking place. “There are growing concerns that China will weaponize its position, but we expect China’s response to remain proportionate and limited based on past actions,” they wrote Monday, adding that the U.S. can also look to alternative suppliers and substitutes. The pair offered a few recommendations for how the U.S. can stabilize its supply of critical minerals to protect the defense industry, support the EV transition, and prevent economic fallout from a potential commodity trade war.  First, Ho and Chang noted that creating new U.S. mining capacity isn’t an option to fix the U.S.’s reliance on mineral imports. New mining operations take years to start, come with environmental risks, and regulatory approval in the U.S. is often uncertain. It takes 16.5 years, on average, for a mining project to move from discovery to production in the U.S., according to the International Energy Agency. And securing a permit for a mine alone takes an average of seven to 10 years. Instead of new mining operations, Ho and Chang recommended the diversification of mineral sourcing, the implementation of new mineral mining technologies, and strategic stockpiling of key minerals. They estimated that technological innovation and recycling could reduce demand by 20% to 40%, while material substitution could alleviate strains on supply and reduce costs over the next few decades. In addition, strategic stockpiling by the US government and corporations could act as a buffer against sudden supply chain disruptions. “More opportunities exist to diversify critical mineral suppliers than there are for oil, and the countries that are in the process of broadening their mining and process capabilities include allies such as Canada, Australia, the EU, and Japan,” they added. “The U.S. should remain optimistic.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

58,"Cedar Attanasio, The Associated Press, Irina Ivanova",Joey Chestnut's former fans have beef with the hot-dog-swallowing star after he said he won't compete this year due to vegan dog sponsorship,https://fortune.com/2024/06/11/joey-chestnut-nathans-hot-dog-contest-no-more/,"“It would be like Michael Jordan saying to Nike, ‘I’m going to represent Adidas, too,’” said the contest organizer.",2024-06-11T21:51:58Z,"Joey “Jaws” Chestnut, the reigning champion of the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, will not participate in this year’s event after signing a deal with a rival brand. Chestnut, 40, has long been the face — not to mention the mouth — of the competition. He has vied for the dog-downing contest’s coveted Mustard Belt since 2005 and has won it almost every year since 2007, with the exception of a rare loss in 2015. In 2021, the Westfield, Indiana, resident ingested 76 franks and buns in 10 minutes, a record that still stands. But Major League Eating event organizer George Shea says Chestnut is moving away from the contest due to a contract dispute. “We love him. The fans love him,” Shea said, adding: “He made the choice.” Chestnut disputed who made the choice, saying on the social platform X, “I do not have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.” In a thread posted Tuesday night after the news broke, Chestnut said he had been training to defend his title at this year’s Independence Day event and only learned through media reports that he wouldn’t be allowed to compete. “I was gutted to learn from the media that after 19 years Im banned,” Chestnut said on X. “To my fans, I love you and appreciate you. Rest assured that you’ll see me eat again soon!! STAY HUNGRY!” Shea says Chestnut struck a deal with a competing brand — a red line for the Nathan’s-sponsored event. He wouldn’t say which brand but told the New York Times that Chestnut will be repping Impossible Foods, which makes vegan sausages. Chestnut declined to comment on the deal to the AP.  Shea said the dispute came down to exclusivity, not money. “It would be like Michael Jordan saying to Nike, ‘I’m going to represent Adidas, too,’” Shea said. In response, Impossible Foods released a statement saying, “We love Joey and support him in any contest he chooses. It’s OK to experiment with a new dog. Meat eaters shouldn’t have to be exclusive to just one wiener.” In May, the company announced an ad campaign aimed at engaging meat-eaters who want to supplement their diet with more plant-based proteins, even if they don’t want to give up meat entirely. The yearly bun fight, which dates back to 1972, sees large crowds of fans in foam hot-dog hats gather in front of the original Nathan’s Famous’ restaurant in Coney Island, Brooklyn, to cheer on the competitors as they chow down. The contestants are allowed to dunk the dogs in cups of water to soften them up, creating a stomach-churning spectacle. Those vying for second place in the past might have renewed hope to chomp their way to victory this year, including international competitors on the eating circuit. Last year’s second-place winner was Geoffrey Esper from Oxford, Massachusetts, who downed 49 dogs to Chestnut’s 62. Third place went to Australia’s James Webb with 47. This isn’t the first time the contest has parted ways with one of its biggest stars. In 2010, Japanese eating champion Takeru Kobayashi, Chestnut’s then-rival, also stopped competing in the annual bun fight due to a contract dispute with Major League Eating. Kobayashi crashed the contest in a T-shirt reading “Free Kobi” and was arrested. He was sentenced to six months’ probation. Kobayashi announced his retirement from the sport last month.

59,"Shona Ghosh, Yazhou Sun, Bloomberg",A London hospital is asking its own workers for blood after a cyberattack,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/12/london-hospital-asking-its-own-workers-for-blood-after-cyberattack-kings-college-national-security/,King’s College Hospital is calling on staff with blood type O to schedule donation.,2024-06-12T08:48:50Z,"A London hospital, facing blood supply disruptions after a cyberattack last week paralyzed operations, is asking its own clinical workers for blood. King’s College Hospital is calling on staff with the blood type O to schedule donations, according to an internal memo sent to staff and reviewed by Bloomberg News. The hospital declined to comment. National Health Service, the publicly funded health care system in England, didn’t respond to a request for comment. The letter followed a broader appeal issued by NHS England to the general public for blood donations and is only the latest fallout from a ransomware attack that has plagued several of the region’s medical centers since June 4. The hack against Synnovis, a provider that helps manage blood transfusions and testing for the hospitals, has forced some facilities to delay medical operations, postpone blood samples and resort to handwritten records. “NHS Blood and Transplant is calling for O blood type donors (both positive and negative) to book appointments in order to support the response to the ransomware cyber attack incident,” Julie Lowe, deputy chief executive of King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said in the internal memo. “Staff are also encouraged to donate blood as well.” O type blood is particularly critical. O negative blood can be given to anyone regardless of their own blood type, and O positive is the most common type. The attack has meant hospitals can’t match patients’ blood at the same frequency as usual, NHS Blood and Transplant said Monday in a statement. The memo also warns that disruptions tied to the hack were expected to continue for the rest of the week, with the trust redirecting “a small number of patients” to other hospitals. Some planned operations and outpatient appointments will likely be canceled, Lowe said. “We still do not know when Synnovis’ systems are likely to be restored, so we should expect to be dealing with this incident for the rest of this week, and beyond,” she added. The attack on Synnovis, a partnership between Synlab UK & Ireland, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, has primarily affected patients of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, King’s College Hospital and primary care in southeast London. The lab services provider has said it is working with NHS England to minimize the impact on patients.  Why Ransomware Hacks Mean Your Money or Your Network: QuickTake The fallout of the attack has rippled across to primary care providers whose practices rely on the affected hospitals for laboratory services.  Azeem Majeed, a physician in south London, said local practices and community services have historically ordered up 10,000 blood samples a day for testing. Providers are now restricted to requesting around 400 a day, he said.  Routine blood tests for patients with conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes and kidney diseases are facing delays, he said, while noting that patients with urgent issues are being prioritized.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

60,"Michael Casey, The Associated Press",Raytheon sued for age discrimination for seeking recent college grads over older workers,https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/raytheon-rtx-sued-aarp-older-worker-age-discrimination-recent-college-grads/,The lawsuit alleges RTX posted ads seeking job applicants who are recent graduates or have less than two years' experience.,2024-06-12T08:47:09Z,"A major defense contractor was sued Tuesday over allegations that it discriminated against older workers in job ads. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Boston accuses RTX Corporation of posting ads that target younger workers at the expense of their older peers in violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act, and the Virginia Human Rights Act. RTX, formerly Raytheon Technologies Corporation, is an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The lawsuit alleges it posted ads seeking job applicants who are recent graduates or have less than two years’ experience, which excluded older workers from consideration or deterred them from applying in the first place. “Americans are living and working longer than ever, yet unfair and discriminatory hiring practices are keeping older workers from jobs they’re qualified for,” the AARP Foundation’s senior vice president for litigation, William Alvarado Rivera, said in a statement. “Raytheon’s intentional discrimination against experienced job candidates, simply because of their age, is illegal and unacceptable.” In a statement, the company denied the allegations. “RTX complies with all relevant age discrimination laws and we’re committed to maintaining a diverse workforce,” RTX said. “We believe these claims are entirely without merit and we will actively defend our hiring practices.” A 2023 AARP survey found that nearly one in six adults reported they were not hired for a job they applied for within the past two years because of their age. Half of job seekers reported they were asked by an employer to produce their birthdate during the application or interview process. About half of Americans also think there’s age discrimination in the workplace, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. But there’s a split by age. The poll finds 60% of adults age 60 and over say older workers in the U.S. are always or often discriminated against, while 43% of adults younger than 45 say the same. The suit, seeking class action status, was filed by the AARP Foundation, Peter Romer-Friedman Law, and Outten & Golden, whose managing partner, Adam Klein, said it should serve as a warning to other big companies engaged in such discrimination. “Fortune 500 companies should know better than to exclude hardworking older Americans from jobs by targeting ‘recent college graduates’ in hiring posts,” Klein said in a statement, adding that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission “has long held that this type of language discourages qualified older workers from applying for jobs.” The plaintiff in the case, Mark Goldstein, 67, alleges he applied for several positions at the company since 2019. Goldstein filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging he wasn’t considered for these jobs, and the EEOC found he was denied due to his age. The EEOC also found Raytheon’s job advertisements violated the ADEA, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit is demanding that the company end practices that discriminate against Goldstein and the “tens of thousands” of potential members of the class action who “have applied, attempted to apply, or have been interested in applying” for jobs. It also demands that the company institute policies that provide “equal employment opportunities for all employees” regardless of their age, and pay damages including backpay to Goldstein and other affected workers. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

61,"Michael Liedtke, The Associated Press",Elizabeth Holmes watches from a Texas prison as appeal of her Theranos fraud conviction begins in federal court,https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/elizabeth-holmes-texas-prison-appeal-theranos-fraud-conviction-federal-court/,The hearing held in the San Francisco appeals court came nearly 2 1/2 years after a jury convicted Holmes for orchestrating a blood-testing scam that became a parable about greed and hubris in Silicon Valley.,2024-06-12T09:35:45Z,"A panel of federal judges spent two hours on Tuesday wrestling with a series of legal issues raised in an attempt to overturn a fraud conviction that sent Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes to prison after a meteoric rise to Silicon Valley stardom. The hearing held in the San Francisco appeals court came nearly 2 1/2 years after a jury convicted Holmes for orchestrating a blood-testing scam that became a parable about greed and hubris in Silicon Valley. Holmes’ instrument of deception was Theranos, a Palo Alto, California, startup that she founded shortly after dropping out of Stanford University in 2003 with her sights set on revolutionizing the health care industry. Holmes, who did not attend the hearing, is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a Bryan, Texas prison. But Holmes’ parents and her partner Billy Evans — the father of her two young children — sat in the front row of the courtroom listening intently to the oral arguments. All three federal prosecutors who presented the U.S. Justice Department’s case during the original four-month trial were sitting in the courtroom audience, including two attorneys — Jeffrey Schenk and John Bostic — who have since gone to work for private law firms. Three appeals court judges — Jacqueline Nguyen, Ryan Nelson and Mary Schroeder — gave few clues into whether they leaned toward upholding or overturning Holmes’ conviction. However, they periodically made it clear that it would take compelling evidence for them to throw out the jury’s verdict. Nelson seemed the most torn of the three judges, showing some sympathy when Holmes’ attorney Amy Saharia said the outcome of her trial deserved close scrutiny because the jury also acquitted her on four other counts of fraud and conspiracy and was unable to reach a verdict on three other counts. Before adjourning the hearing, Nguyen said a ruling would be issued in “due course” without providing a specific timeline. Appeals courts can take anywhere from a few weeks to more than a year before ruling on appeals involving criminal convictions. Holmes will remain in prison, with a currently scheduled release date of August 2032 — earlier than her full sentence because of her good behavior so far. A decade ago, Theranos had become such a hot health care commodity that it was called an exemplar of U.S. ingenuity by several prominent people, including then-Vice President Joe Biden. Holmes had emerged as a media sensation with a fortune worth $4.5 billion. The excitement stemmed from Holmes’ claim that Theranos-designed devices could scan a few drops of human blood for hundreds of potential diseases. But the devices produced unreliable results that both Holmes and her former business partner and lover at the time, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, attempted to hide. Once the glaring flaws of its technology were exposed, Theranos collapsed in a scandal that led to criminal charges being filed against both Holmes and Balwani. Prosecutors hoped to break a “fake-it-till-you-make-it” mentality that had been adopted by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs hoping to strike it rich with still-buggy products. Besides hearing from Holmes’ lawyers Tuesday, the panel of appeals judges also listened to arguments from another flank of attorneys representing Balwani, who is trying to overturn the 13-year prison sentence he received after his July 2022 conviction for fraud and conspiracy in a separate trial. Balwani, 58, contends federal prosecutors distorted evidence to bias the jury against him while weaving a different narrative than the story they presented during Holmes’ trial, which was completed shortly before Balwani’s trial began in March 2022. Unlike Holmes, Balwani was convicted on all 12 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy facing him, a factor that contributed to his lengthier prison sentence. He is currently scheduled to be released from a Southern California federal prison in November 2033. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

62,"James Tarmy, Bloomberg",The world's richest are reconsidering their spending at Art Basel,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/12/the-worlds-richest-are-reconsidering-their-spending-at-art-basel/,"The question wasn’t if dealers would sell art to attendees, but rather which collectors would actually show up, and how much they’d be willing to spend.",2024-06-12T09:18:35Z,"People don’t trek to Art Basel in Switzerland just for fun. Famed for being the highest-quality art fair in the world, the O.G. Swiss fair is a place where people tend to stay exactly as long as they need to and no longer. “It’s not a fair like New York or Miami where there’s more going on in the city,” says Malik Al-Mahrouky, a partner at Kurimanzutto gallery, standing in his booth during the opening VIP day. “Here, people come with a very specific mindset to acquire art.” (VIP days are June 11 and 12; the fair is open to the public from June 13 to 16.) And so even though the art market is down significantly—the major May New York auctions fell roughly 23% year over year by value—the question going into this edition of Art Basel wasn’t if dealers would sell art to attendees, but rather which collectors would actually show up, and how much they’d be willing to spend.  The first question was answered at 10 a.m. on Tuesday morning, when a large, civilized scrum of well-dressed, predominantly older VIPs shivered in the convention center’s chilly inner courtyard as they fortified themselves with Champagne and espresso during the annual pre-fair welcome breakfast.  The composition of the collectors, however, begged further scrutiny. “This year it’s very different,” said the New York dealer Carol Greene, standing in her gallery’s booth soon after the doors opened. “It’s predominantly European. The Americans stayed home this year, which for us, as an American gallery, actually can be good because we get a chance to develop [new] relationships.” While there were definitely some American accents echoing through the halls, Al-Mahrouky noticed the same. “There’s a lot of American advisors present, but they’re not with their clients in the way they were last year,” he said, adding that several clients are planning to swing by the fair at the end of the week, a phenomenon that in itself is somewhat unprecedented. “It seems as if there’s not an urgency to be here during the pandemonium of the first day,” he said. “I think it’s a response to the market, but I think it’s also symptomatic of fair fatigue as well.” The question of spending was harder to parse. As is the custom for virtually every art fair, dealers did their best to pre-sell much of their booths, meaning that they sent out PDFs of the work a week or two in advance in the hopes that collectors will buy the art sight-unseen.  Greene says she pre-sold a large abstract work by the in-demand artist Justin Caguiat; Al-Mahrouky pre-sold a series of works by the artist Ana Segovia.  But many dealers said pre-sales failed to live up to expectations. In comparison to years past, where collectors would either buy the work in advance, or place a work on reserve then rush to confirm the sale as the fair began, this year “people are coming to look at things in person,” says Lisson Gallery Chief Executive Officer Alex Logsdail. “They’re making real, informed decisions, and that’s happening throughout the week.”  The extended sales period, he adds, is something everyone needs to get used to. “If day one wasn’t a complete, blowout success, it doesn’t mean the market isn’t functioning. Business will get done.” (By the end of the first day Logsdail’s gallery had sold more than a dozen artworks, including an $850,000 painting by Lee Ufan.) Several other blue-chip galleries reported major sales, many of which were presumably lined up in advance and consummated at the fair. Pace sold three editions of a large multi-part sculpture by Jean Dubuffet for €800,000 ($859,000) apiece; it also sold a giant sculpture by Torkwase Dyson exhibited in the Unlimited section (a cavernous hall next to the main fair where large-size works are installed), which was bought by Brazil’s Inhotim museum for $380,000. Hauser & Wirth reported selling a $16 million work on paper by Arshile Gorky, a $3.5 million sculpture by Louise Bourgeois, and a painting made in 2022 by Henry Taylor for $1.5 million. Thaddaeus Ropac says it sold a Robert Rauschenberg work on canvas for $3.85 million, and multiple editions of a sculpture by Georg Baselitz for €2 million. These transactions all occurred at galleries on the ground floor of the convention center, where established dealers are expected to sell major artworks for high prices. Upstairs, where smaller galleries tend to sell newer work by less established artists, prices were lower.  “I would hazard a guess that the safe price point this year, at this particular fair, would be around $200,000 to $600,000,” says Kibum Kim, a partner at the LA gallery Commonwealth and Council. “A lot of people realize that they’ve been overpaying for artists whose markets have been inflated very fast; but they think, ‘You know, a couple hundred thousand dollars is a safer bet.” As the first day progressed, there was even some competition. “One or two things which I liked were gone,” says Antonio Sersale, who owns the Positano hotel Le Sirenuse. “But that’s OK,” he adds. “The best thing you can do is go to a gallery, see the work of an artist you already have, and realize that it’s sold, which is fantastic—it’s a reaffirmation.” (Sersale did manage, he says, to buy four works by the Italian artist Isabella Ducrot.)  Even if the first VIP day’s results didn’t indicate that the art market had somehow turned a corner, they did demonstrate that some collectors have no intention of holding back—regardless of whether or not the market is down. “I was not cautious coming into it thinking there’s some kind of an ambient dark cloud” hovering over the art market, says the US-based collector Kunal Patra, as he toured the fair. “From a personal perspective, I was like, ‘Hey, if I like something, and if it’s within a price point that I can afford, I’ll buy it.’ ” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

63,"David Klepper, The Associated Press","Why Russia, China and Big Tech all use fake female online profiles to get clicks",https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/fake-female-online-profiles/,The human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual.,2024-06-12T09:47:42Z,"When disinformation researcher Wen-Ping Liu looked into China’s efforts to influence Taiwan’s recent election using fake social media accounts, something unusual stood out about the most successful profiles. They were female, or at least that’s what they appeared to be. Fake profiles that claimed to be women got more engagement, more eyeballs and more influence than supposedly male accounts. “Pretending to be a female is the easiest way to get credibility,” said Liu, an investigator with Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice. Whether it’s Chinese or Russian propaganda agencies, online scammers or AI chatbots, it pays to be female — proving that while technology may grow more and more sophisticated, the human brain remains surprisingly easy to hack thanks in part to age-old gender stereotypes that have migrated from the real world to the virtual. People have long assigned human characteristics like gender to inanimate objects — ships are one example — so it makes sense that human-like traits would make fake social media profiles or chatbots more appealing. However, questions about how these technologies can reflect and reinforce gender stereotypes are getting attention as more voice assistants and AI-enabled chatbots enter the market, further blurring the lines between man (and woman) and machine. “You want to inject some emotion and warmth and a very easy way to do that is to pick a woman’s face and voice,” said Sylvie Borau, a marketing professor and online researcher in Toulouse, France, whose work has found that internet users prefer “female” bots and see them as more human than “male” versions. People tend to see women as warmer, less threatening and more agreeable than men, Borau told The Associated Press. Men, meanwhile, are often perceived to be more competent, though also more likely to be threatening or hostile. Because of this many people may be, consciously or unconsciously, more willing to engage with a fake account that poses as female. When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was searching for a new voice for the ChatGPT AI program, he approached Scarlett Johansson, who said Altman told her that users would find her voice — which served as the eponymous voice assistant in the movie “Her” — “comforting.” Johansson declined Altman’s request and threatened to sue when the company went with what she called an “eerily similar” voice. OpenAI put the new voice on hold. Feminine profile pictures, particularly ones showing women with flawless skin, lush lips and wide eyes in revealing outfits, can be another online lure for many men. Users also treat bots differently based on their perceived sex: Borau’s research has found that “female” chatbots are far more likely to receive sexual harassment and threats than “male” bots. Female social media profiles receive on average more than three times the views compared to those of males, according to an analysis of more than 40,000 profiles conducted for the AP by Cyabra, an Israeli tech firm that specializes in bot detection. Female profiles that claim to be younger get the most views, Cyabra found. “Creating a fake account and presenting it as a woman will help the account gain more reach compared to presenting it as a male,” according to Cyabra’s report. The online influence campaigns mounted by nations like China and Russia have long used faux females to spread propaganda and disinformation. These campaigns often exploit people’s views of women. Some appear as wise, nurturing grandmothers dispensing homespun wisdom, while others mimic young, conventionally attractive women eager to talk politics with older men. Last month, researchers at the firm NewsGuard found hundreds of fake accounts — some boasting AI-generated profile pictures — were used to criticize President Joe Biden. It happened after some Trump supporters began posting a personal photo with the announcement that they “will not be voting for Joe Biden.” While many of the posts were authentic, more than 700 came from fake accounts. Most of the profiles claimed to be young women living in states like Illinois or Florida; one was named PatriotGal480. But many of the accounts used nearly identical language, and had profile photos that were AI-generated or stolen from other users. And while they couldn’t say for sure who was operating the fake accounts, they found dozens with links to nations including Russia and China. X removed the accounts after NewsGuard contacted the platform. A report from the U.N. suggested there’s an even more obvious reason why so many fake accounts and chatbots are female: they were created by men. The report, entitled “ Are Robots Sexist?,” looked at gender disparities in tech industries and concluded that greater diversity in programming and AI development could lead to fewer sexist stereotypes embedded in their products. For programmers eager to make their chatbots as human as possible, this creates a dilemma, Borau said: if they select a female persona, are they encouraging sexist views about real-life women? “It’s a vicious cycle,” Borau said. “Humanizing AI might dehumanize women.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

64,"Haven Daley, Olga R. Rodriguez, The Associated Press",California winemakers and an international nonprofit are bringing over Ukrainian peers,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/california-winemakers-ukrainian-regenerative-agriculture-demining/,"“We are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm ... into this land,” said Georgiy Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine’s Black Sea region.",2024-06-13T08:04:27Z,"As the head of an association of winemakers in southern Ukraine, Georgiy Molchanov knows a lot about how to cultivate grapes; not so much how to grow them amid undetonated mines. But that was the situation he found himself in after a Russian rocket dropped the explosives on his vineyard near the port city of Mykolaiv in August 2022, six months after Russia invaded. The damage — and danger — the mines brought to his business marked one of the myriad catastrophic effects the more than 2-year-old war has had on the eastern European country. Now, thanks to the combined efforts of the international nonprofit organization Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and the Grgich Hills Estate winery in Napa Valley, Molchanov is taking the steps he needs to reclaim and heal his wounded land. First, Roots of Peace and Rotary International provided him with the expertise and supplies he needed to safely detonate the mines. Then, the groups teamed up to bring him and five other Ukrainian winemakers to Grgich Hills in Rutherford. During a weeklong stay here, they learned about regenerative organic farming, an agricultural method that prioritizes soil health and ecosystem balance. “We are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm … into this land,” said Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine’s Black Sea region. He and his fellow entrepreneurs have another goal as well: to spread the message that, despite the ongoing war, the Ukrainian people remain resilient and look forward to life in peace. “People in Ukraine are still alive,” said Svitlana Tsybak, Owner and CEO of Beykush Winery, also located in the Mykolaiv area. “Yes, war is in our soul, in our life, but we need … to live our lives so, of course, we need to work.” Tsybak said Russian troops are staked out about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from her vineyard but the war hasn’t directly affected her operations. Her winery started exporting wine to the United States six months ago. She said she wants to learn how to expand the presence of Ukrainian wine in the U.S. market. Heidi Kuhn, a California peace activist who founded Roots of Peace, has worked for decades to remove landmines from war-ravaged land that she later helps to convert into vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields. Rotary International, which has collaborated for years with Roots of Peace, helped plan the program for the Ukrainian winemakers and funded their travel to California. “There’s an estimated 110 million landmines in 60 countries, and today Ukraine tragically has over 30% of the land riddled with landmines,” said Kuhn, whose program is known as the “mines to vines” initiative. In 2000, Kuhn worked with the founder of Grgich Hills Estate, the late Croatian immigrant Miljenko “Mike” Grgich, and other vintners to raise funds to clear landmines in Vukovar in eastern Croatia. The town, located in a winemaking region on the banks of the Danube, was reduced to rubble during the 1991-95 war in the former Yugoslavia. Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich’s nephew, a native Croatian and a winemaker at Grgich Hills Estate, said he feels deeply for Ukrainians because he understands how heart-wrenching it is to live through war. He said the family winery has for decades helped Roots of Peace. “This is just the beginning of a hopeful relationship to literally restore the health of this country,” he said. “I hope that not only they see how farming can be conducted without harmful chemicals, but also that they’re inspired and that their hope is elevated.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

65,"Tehmina Haider, Michael O'Leary",Climate technology forgot the consumer is still king,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/climate-technology-consumer-king-ev-retail-environment/,We can’t blame consumers for climate change until we give them better options.,2024-06-13T11:17:21Z,"Tehmina Haider and Michael O’Leary lead L Catterton Impact, the impact investing arm of the consumer private equity firm L Catterton. Michael is also the author of Accountable: The Rise of Citizen Capitalism (HarperCollins 2020). This spring, ExxonMobil chief Darren Woods came under fire after telling Fortune Magazine that consumers—not ExxonMobil—were the ones holding back the transition to clean energy. “We have opportunities to make fuels with lower carbon in it,” he said, “but people aren’t willing to spend the money to do that.” The SEC’s new rules on climate disclosures similarly put emissions on consumers’ shoulders: though public companies must now report their emissions, they don’t have to include the emissions that come from consumers using their products. Instead, those emissions implicitly remain part of the consumer’s carbon footprint. Many in the climate community bristle at blaming consumers. After all, even the concept of a consumer’s “carbon footprint” was only popularized by a BP-funded ad campaign in the early 2000s. But Darren Woods is right in principle: It doesn’t matter what sustainable products companies create if consumers don’t buy them. We shouldn’t blame consumers for companies’ actions, but we should focus on what they actually want to buy. Within the climate movement, we’ve too often taken an “if we build it, they will come” approach to climate investing, assuming that if we can just develop the technology, then climate-conscious consumers will be eager to adopt it. Consider transportation and food, which together make up roughly half of a consumer’s total emissions in many countries. Within each, we’ve developed technologies that offer substantial reductions, but we’re now seeing just how fickle consumer adoption can be. According to the Department of Energy’s latest analysis, the cradle-to-grave emissions for today’s electric vehicles are 48% lower than comparable gas vehicles. However, electric vehicles only made up 7.6% of automotive sales in the U.S. last year, up from 5.9% the previous year but still a long way from the two-thirds share some project for 2030. Within our food system, independent assessments of alternative proteins suggest emissions savings of up to 90% compared with beef, similar in scale to the savings from adopting a vegan diet. But at just 2% market share, alternative proteins have yet to break into the mainstream. Overall, consumption accounts for 72% of greenhouse gas emissions, just above consumer’s 68% share of U.S. gross domestic product. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, we need to cut per capita emissions by 50% within the decade. But whatever emissions savings these and other climate technologies boast will only come to fruition if consumers love them enough to pull out their wallets. At the impact fund we lead, we’ve seen that despite the many studies citing how much consumers—especially younger consumers—care about shopping more sustainably, the reality is more complicated. For any category, consumers tend to have a set of criteria they care most about, like price, quality, or convenience. Eighty percent of consumers now say it’s important for brands to be sustainable, but sustainability is almost never among their most important criteria. If forced to make a trade-off between sustainability and those other factors, support for the sustainable option can collapse by 70% or more. Indeed, one way to tell the story of the stalling growth of plant-based meat is that as close as it’s gotten to mimicking meat, it still fails to outperform on consumers’ most important criteria of taste and nutrition. Many consumers marvel at these almost-meat alternatives, but not enough prefer them. The only way to drive long-term adoption of a sustainable product is by flipping the trade-off, and finding ways to make its sustainability a positive driver of the other criteria that consumers care about. Ironically, only when consumers prefer the sustainable product for reasons unrelated to sustainability will it achieve mainstream success. For example, far more consumers will say they buy a dairy alternative because it’s healthier and tastes better than because of any desire to help the environment, something organic produce has long benefited from. Electric heat pumps, which now make up a majority of new heating system sales in the U.S., save money for the average consumer. More Gen Z consumers say they shop sustainable brands because of quality or value rather than concern about the climate. As with any consumer market, segments of consumers may weigh factors differently. For decades, cars sold in Europe have had roughly 50% better fuel economy on average than those sold in the United States. That’s not because of unique European technology. That’s because of historical consumer preferences supported by tighter regulations. Similar patterns are playing out again with electric vehicles, as penetration in Europe is double that in the U.S. Though much of the conversation about climate companies focuses on the cutting edge of the technology landscape, innovation in business models can also be highly impactful. Resale, rentals, refillable products, and reusable packaging all require very little novel technology but can still outperform on consumers’ key purchasing criteria. Secondhand apparel has grown far faster than apparel at large, for example, mostly because it satisfies consumers’ desire to save money. The lesson is simple: The consumer is still king. If we hope to make significant progress towards a world with net zero emissions, we need to build products they want to buy more than the traditional alternatives. And that matters far more than on whose environmental balance sheet we decide to measure those emissions. We can’t blame consumers for climate change until we give them better options.

66,"Mark Gurman, Bloomberg",Apple isn’t paying OpenAI to use ChatGPT,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/apple-not-paying-openai-chatgpt-millions-users-iphones-devices/,"Apple believes pushing OpenAI’s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments, sources said.",2024-06-13T11:42:44Z,"When Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and his top deputies this week unveiled a landmark arrangement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone, iPad and Mac, they were mum on the financial terms. Left unanswered on Monday: which company is paying the other as part of a tight collaboration that has potentially lasting monetary benefits for both. But, according to people briefed on the matter, the partnership isn’t expected to generate meaningful revenue for either party — at least at the outset. The arrangement includes weaving ChatGPT, a digital assistant that responds in plain terms to information requests, into Apple’s Siri and new writing tools. Apple isn’t paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal terms are private. Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI’s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments, these people said. Meanwhile, Apple, thanks to OpenAI, gets the benefit of offering an advanced chatbot to consumers — potentially enticing users to spend more time on devices or even splash out on upgrades. Representatives of Apple and OpenAI declined to comment. The pact with OpenAI is part of a broader push by Apple into AI. The iPhone maker laid out the plans during a keynote address at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, showing off AI features for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. The non-ChatGPT capabilities — branded as Apple Intelligence — were designed by the company in-house.  But even if money wasn’t a major factor in the Apple-OpenAI deal, remuneration could come into play later.  Under the current structure, the partnership could become costly for OpenAI, which needs to pay Microsoft Corp. to host ChatGPT on that company’s Azure cloud-computing systems. The more people use ChatGPT, the more OpenAI’s expenses rise. And the integration into Apple devices — while optional for users and limited to the company’s recent products — threatens to add significantly to the computing budget. ChatGPT will be offered for free on Apple’s products, but OpenAI and Apple could still make money by converting free users to paid accounts. OpenAI’s subscription plans start at $20 a month — a fee that covers extra features like the ability to analyze data and generate more types of images.  Today, if a user subscribes to OpenAI on an Apple device via the ChatGPT app, the process uses Apple’s payment platform, which traditionally gives the iPhone maker a cut. Apple’s deal with OpenAI isn’t exclusive, and the iPhone maker is already discussing offering Google’s Gemini chatbot as an additional option. That agreement should be in place later this year. Apple has also held talks with Anthropic as a potential chatbot partner, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg earlier this year. The idea is to ultimately offer a range of AI services to users — similar to the way Apple has different search engine options in its Safari browser. Eventually, Apple aims to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing agreements whereby it gets a cut from AI partners that monetize results in chatbots on Apple platforms, according to the people. The company believes that AI could chip away at the billions of dollars it gets from its Google search deal because users will favor chatbots and other tools over search engines. Apple will need to craft new arrangements that make up for the shortfall. Apple’s own AI services won’t be as costly to deliver because most of them are handled on the devices themselves, rather than through cloud computing. Still, the company is ramping up its data center operations to support new online AI services that handle more advanced tasks. To make Apple Intelligence a success, the company will need to expand it to other languages and countries. That may be a challenge in China, one of Apple’s biggest overseas markets, where services like ChatGPT and Gemini are barred.  The company has yet to reach a deal with a local Chinese provider to handle chatbot features, but has been considering an arrangement with companies such as Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to the people. For now, Apple Intelligence is only available in American English, but the company is aiming to support more languages next year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Today we meet Jesper Brodin, CEO of IKEA.",2024-06-13T11:33:53Z,"CEO Agenda provides unique insights into how leaders think and lead and what keeps them busy in a world of constant change. We look into the lives, minds and agendas of CEOs at the world’s most iconic companies. Jesper Brodin is the CEO of Sweden’s most famous furniture company. Since he took over the yellow giant’s global retail operations in 2017, the company underwent a drastic transformation. INGKA Group (the official name of IKEA’s retail arm) under his tenure became a net producer of green energy; opened second-hand shops and recycling programs in most of its locations; and in some key markets, like Germany, now sells more veggie meatballs than real ones.  Behind this strategic and operational shift is a man who deeply contemplates the role he and his company play in the world. Yes, Brodin thinks about IKEA’s growth and profitability, and the company’s 20% growth in recent years attest to that commitment. But he’d feel bad if that was his only legacy, he says, when the world he grew up in is at risk of disappearing, both because the middle class is under pressure, and climate change is already wreaking havoc in many parts of the world.  69 We couldn’t think of a better candidate to open our new “CEO Agenda” series, where we explore what goes on in the lives and minds of some of the world’s most influential and admired business leaders. Today we meet with the CEO of Ingka Group, Jesper Brodin. This interview has been edited for brevity.   Fortune: What is the single most important project you are working on with your company? Jesper Brodin: The single most important one is how we can better serve people with thin wallets – by becoming more affordable. At the same time, growing our business and reducing carbon in line with the Paris Agreement. We know being a good business is good for business, and we want to inspire many more to follow. Which long-term trend are you most bullish about for society and the economy at large? Climate change. We are in the most important decade of climate action, and it’s our generation’s responsibility to solve and change the course of the present trend. We still have it in our hands, and even if we can see slight positive movement, we need to speed up and collaborate across society, businesses and governments. If you were an economic policymaker, what would be your top priority?    To ensure that we incentivize the right investments when it comes to transitioning to net-zero. “We are in the most important decade of climate action, and it’s our generation’s responsibility to solve and change the course of the present trend.”  What time do you get up, and what part of your morning routine sets you up for the day? Coffee is important….  Even after 7 hours of good sleep! What time do you work until? Do you continue sending emails during the night and/or weekends? I try to stop around 6 pm. After work, I enjoy spending time with my family and exercising. This isn’t always the case – but I try. My job never ends, and I could work until midnight and still not be done. What apps or methods do you use to be more productive? Best method: spend time with family, nature, and exercise. And laugh often! Who is on your “personal board”? My wife and my three teenage kids. Thanks to them, I get a reality check on what’s important in life. I also have a close relationship with our chair; Lars-Johan Jarnheimer, who has been and continues to be a great support in challenging times, with his simple and pragmatic approach.  What book have you read, either recently or in the past, that has inspired you? I recently read “The Hydrogen Revolution” by Marco Alvera. I enjoy a good old Steinbeck or Dostojevski, however, this was one of the most educational reads in a long time. If you could ask your idol one question, who would it be, and what would you ask? I have many idols…. I would ask my Youth Council what more we can do to spread hope and stimulate actions for a better world. I would also ask Douglas Adams if the answer to the meaning of life and everything is still 42. As a consumer, what is your favorite company and why? Assuming I cannot vote for IKEA, I will go for Volvo Cars. They make great vehicles and have committed to transforming to 100% electric by 2030, despite the challenges. That’s leadership, in my opinion. And to end on a lighter note: What was the last costume you wore? A tux, if that counts. I felt a bit dressed up since that’s not my usual attire.

On Wednesday, the European Commission said it will impose duties of up to 38.1% on Chinese-made EVs, starting next month. The response in Chinese state media was fierce. One commentary piece from Xinhua, China’s state media agency, called the decision “misguided” and a “thinly veiled excuse for protectionism.” Another published Xinhua piece noted that the EU’s “best-laid plan for [an] economic boom” is to partner with China. An opinion piece in the Global Times, a state-owned English-language media outlet, claimed that Europe had “chosen to surrender to protectionism.” Chinese officials also made their displeasure known. Officials at the commerce ministry said the EU’s tariffs were “counter to the spirit of cooperation.” Chinese EV makers largely did not publicly criticize the EU’s decision in the wake of the announcement. Chinese EV company Nio said it opposed the EU’s decision but remained committed to the European EV market. Other Chinese brands, like BYD and Chery, have announced plans to build cars in Europe, which would not be subject to the tariffs. Previously, Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD pushed back against claims that their success was the result of state support, instead crediting fierce competition at home and internal efficiency. Shares of major Chinese EV makers and startups appeared to be unaffected by the ruling. Shares in BYD rose almost 6% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday; the Chinese EV giant is subject to a lower EU tariff rate than several of its Chinese peers. Nio shares rose 2%, while SAIC Motor—subject to the highest tariffs—dropped 1.5%. Only tariffs exceeding 50% would make the European market unattractive to Chinese EV makers, research firm Rhodium claimed in a report in late April. The tariffs do not enjoy unanimous support in Europe. The German Association of the Automotive Industry said the potential damage caused may be greater than the benefits. Major German car brands are still big players in the Chinese market and could potentially be at risk of retaliatory tariffs. China accounted for about a third of sales from BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz in the first quarter of 2024. Other European goods, like luxury items, wine, and agricultural products, could also be threatened by Chinese retaliation. In January, Beijing launched an antidumping probe into French brandy, months after the EU’s anti-subsidy probe into EVs, which analysts described as a possible “first bullet” in a Europe-China trade war. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

69,"Matthew Daly, The Associated Press","Senate confirms 2 new energy regulators, extending Biden’s grip on renewables-backing panel beyond the end of his first term",https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/senate-2-new-energy-regulators-bidens-grip-renewables-backing-panel-first-term/,The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday.,2024-06-13T07:56:53Z,"President Joe Biden’s grip on a key federal energy commission will last beyond his first term, giving a boost to the Democrat’s push for renewable energy regardless of the election results in November. The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said confirmation of the three nominees would allow FERC to “keep its quorum and continue its mission of providing Americans with affordable, reliable, safe energy.” The five-member commission oversees natural gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, including transmission of electricity across state lines. The panel approved a long-awaited rule last month making it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid — a key part of Biden’s goal to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050. The rule is aimed at boosting the nation’s aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses. Earlier this week, the agency approved a request by the nearly $8 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin sending natural gas across rugged mountainsides in West Virginia and Virginia, despite longstanding objections from environmental groups, landowners and some elected officials. On Wednesday, the Senate approved the nominations of Democrat David Rosner and Republican Lindsay See for three and four-year terms, respectively, on the commission. Senators also limited debate on Democrat Judy Chang’s nomination to a five-year term. A final vote on Chang’s nomination to replace Democrat Allison Clements could occur as soon as Thursday. If approved as expected, the vote would give Democrats a working majority on the commission until at least June 2026, when the term of Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips is set to expire. “A fully seated, bipartisan FERC provides more opportunity for advancing long-lasting, sensible energy infrastructure policy,” said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. “When it comes to fairly assessing all interests, five heads are better than one,” Manchin said Wednesday. “Bringing together five different people, with five different life experiences and perspectives, helps ensure that all affected interests will be heard and fairly considered and assessed” by the energy commission. Rosner, See and Chang “are very different people, from very different backgrounds,” said Manchin, who supported all three nominees. “What matters most is their willingness to work with one another, to consider and assess fairly different interests and points of view, and to put partisan passions aside in favor of the public interest.” Rosner, a former FERC staffer, has spent the past two years on Manchin’s Democratic staff on the energy committee. See, who serves as solicitor general for the state of West Virginia, argued the state’s case challenging a major U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule on power plant pollution before the Supreme Court. Chang, of Massachusetts, is a former undersecretary of energy and climate solutions for the state government. Manchin said he knows Rosner well: “I have seen firsthand his expert knowledge on energy issues, his fairness, his nonpartisan approach to every problem we’ve had, and his ability to work with both sides on these issues, and he’s done that tremendously.” Manchin, a political moderate who plays a crucial role on energy issues, called See “a very capable and experienced lawyer” who is “well-qualified to serve on the commission.” Chang, who now teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School, led energy policy under Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. “I can think of no better preparation for serving on a bipartisan commission than working for a Republican administration in a very blue state,” Manchin said. Rosner’s nomination was approved, 67-27, while See won approval, 83-12. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia opposed both nominations, saying he continued to be unhappy about federal approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a longtime Manchin priority. “I voted no on rubber-stamping the same old people to FERC,” Kaine said in a statement. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

70,"Youkyung Lee, Bloomberg",Illegal short selling trades in South Korea could now get you life in prison,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/13/illegal-short-selling-trades-life-in-prison-south-korea/,South Korea's government extended a ban on short selling to next March as it tries to root out practices like naked short selling.,2024-06-13T09:07:52Z,"South Korea is extending a ban on stock short selling through March 30 next year and planning harsher penalties for illegal trades.  “If short selling is resumed without a monitoring system in place, there is the risk that massive illegal activities may be repeated,” said Kim Soyoung, vice chair at the Financial Services Commission. “It will be allowed from March 31 after the platform is ready,” he said, adding that it’s difficult to say whether the rule change will be applied to all stocks.  The government banned the trade in November to root out naked short selling—a practice of selling shares without borrowing them first—which is illegal in the country. The restrictions were due to expire at the end of this month, but authorities have recently signaled that the deadline will be extended until a system to detect improper trades is ready.  In an earlier Thursday statement, the government said it will increase financial penalties and jail terms up to life imprisonment for illicit activities. Same terms on repayment and margin requirements will be applied for retail and institutional investors to create a level playing field, it said.     While retail investors have welcomed the short-selling ban, the move has been controversial within the financial community as the strategy is widely used by money managers in other markets. MSCI Inc. said in its annual market accessibility review that the country’s short-selling accessibility is “deteriorating.”  “It’s better late than never,” said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global Ptd. “I’m optimistic that the resumption of short selling would increase liquidity in South Korea and lower volatility.” Nonetheless, the moves showed that “regulations in South Korea, like China, could change overnight and tarnished the image of the nation,” he added.  South Korea’s equity benchmark Kospi Index closed 1% higher on Thursday, trimming gains of as much as 1.8%.   Authorities are planning penalties of up to six times the profit from illegal short selling, up from five times now, the statement said. Those whose profit from such trading misdeeds is at least 5 billion won ($3.6 million) can face up to life in prison, a change from a maximum 30-year jail term previously.  The government will also adopt a repayment period of 90 days for both retail and institutional investors, which can be extended up to twelve months. Those who engage in illegal short selling will be restricted from serving as executives at listed companies and financial firms in Korea. Stricter rules will also be applied in disclosing short positions. The changes would need parliamentary approval.   Shortly after the trade was banned, South Korea launched an investigation into global banks to scrutinize their past transactions of short selling. Investigators have so far found $156 million worth of illegal short trades by nine global investment banks, most of which were procedural rule violations.    © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

71,"Helen Chandler-Wilde, Bloomberg","Viral videos of jacket potatoes are racking up millions of views on TikTok, prompting people to travel across the world just for a taste",https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/13/viral-videos-jacket-potatoes-are-racking-up-millions-of-views-tiktok-spudman-british-uk/,Potentially sparking concerns over a potato shortage.,2024-06-13T09:24:56Z,"If your TikTok algorithm doesn’t factor in news from the UK, you might still be unaware of the jacket potato mania that’s raging throughout Britain. You’re in the minority. Over the last six months, videos of jacket potatoes with no-nonsense toppings like tuna mayonnaise or baked beans—a staple of UK home-cooking that Americans will recognize as an alternate universe version of a loaded baked potato—have racked up hundreds of millions of views. It’s even brought people from halfway around the world to the center of England to sample this culinary craze. (Americans that have become familiar with TikTok’s tuna salad stuffed jacket potatoes are not generally sold on the subject.)  Ben Newman, aka “Spudman,” has a hard time explaining the phenomenon. “I’m sure we’re good, but we are just a humble spud van,” he says.  An average Spudman TikTok video that shows him stuffing a mundane baked potato in his food truck routinely get 30 million views, sometimes more than 100 million. And the hearty food trend has showed no signs of slowing, even with the arrival of summer.  Before going viral, Newman would sell around 300 jacket potatoes a day from his van in Tamworth, Staffordshire, a business he’s had for 22 years.  In 2020 he started posting videos on TikTok to keep customers coming during the pandemic. By the middle of 2023, around 350,000 followers—a mix of Brits who liked the familiarity and international viewers intrigued by typical British fare—were watching him bake potatoes and chat with customers. After a random 2023 video of a jacket potato attracted around half a million views, his following skyrocketed to a current tally of around 3.5 million.  Those followers have sparked demand: Business has jumped around 400% since Newman began making TikTok videos, and he now sells up to 1,500 potatoes a day to customers who sometimes queue for hours. With potatoes starting at £4 ($5) for options such as cheese and beans, he’s taking in several thousand pounds a day. (Newman won’t confirm his sales figures.) So far, Newman hasn’t been hit by a shortage of potatoes, but he’s not ruling it out. “We source our potatoes locally to keep food miles down,” he says. “I’m worried the potato farmer won’t be able to keep up.” Spudman customers even have an impact on Tamworth’s shops and cafes, as they fortify themselves with cups of coffee and bottles of water before heading to the van. “The knock-on effect for the whole town has been great too,” says Newman. “Lots of local businesses come to me and say they’ve had the best January and February they’ve ever had.” Customers are driving for hours, even getting on flights. “One guy flew to Gatwick from the Philippines, hired a car, drove up to meet us and eat a potato, stayed overnight in a hotel and then flew back,” relates Newman. “One of our customers last week was from Wyoming.” But recently, the local jacket potato scene has been rocked by the arrival of the Spud Bros, who’ve launched a jacket potato van in Preston, Lancashire, a two-hour drive away. Its 1.7 million TikTok followers are treated to videos of brothers Jacob and Harley Nelson baking potatoes with traditional toppings, along with the Lancashire specialty, parched peas.  The Spud Bros appearance has led to clashes between fans of the two accounts. Spudman says he doesn’t mind the new jacket potato stars. “Imitation is the finest form of flattery,” he says. “It’s like Ronaldo/Messi,” said Harley Nelson on a podcast. “We respect each other, but we need that rivalry.” Danny Malin, host of the YouTube channel Rate My Takeaway, labels the rivalry “jacket potato wars.”  While he ever so slightly prefers Spud Bros, he says both are notable. He prefers Spudman’s homemade chicken curry and coleslaw, but likes the Spud Bros’ flavored butters. Still, customers are “not going for the potato, they’re going to meet Spudman, and to go on their feed and to put it on their TikTok,” Malin says. “It’s for their claim to fame.” Unsurprisingly, other vendors are jumping in. Lauren Jones is the operator of the Baked Potato Company by Tatie Lady. Last autumn she debuted her van in Barnsley, West Yorkshire. On opening day, the wait was two hours. After Spudman offered a day of free jacket potatoes in January, business got even more intense for Jones. “Everyone got an obsession with jacket potatoes,” she says, which led to increased demand at her own van. She now sells around 400 potatoes a day. “I think people like it, because it’s traditional,” Jones says, in an effort to explain the phenomenon. Plus, for under £5, you can get a meal that’s cheaper than fast food options — her potatoes start at £3, while the price of a fish and chips order is now routinely in the double digits. “It’s a proper British staple food and comfort food, but it’s not unhealthy either,” she says. “When I go on holiday and come home, the first thing I want is a jacket.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

72,Orianna Rosa Royle,Instagram boss Adam Mosseri reveals he argued a lot with Mark Zuckerberg in the early years,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/instagram-adam-mosseri-argued-with-meta-mark-zuckerberg/,"Instagram boss Adam Mosseri said he used to argue with Mark Zuckerberg ‘a lot’ but has now""built trust"" in their relationship.",2024-06-13T10:17:29Z,"Instagram’s chief, Adam Mosseri, has shared a glimpse of what it’s like to report to Meta’s mastermind, Mark Zuckerberg. Mosseri has enjoyed a rapid rise at the social media giant since since joining Facebook in 2008, and although the pair clearly get on now, the product designer turned head of Instagram revealed that their relationship wasn’t always smooth sailing. “We argued a lot in the early years,” Mosseri said. “I remember pushing back a lot on a number of random unimportant design specifics. “He was very results-focused and I cared about things I still care about now, but I didn’t care enough about other things. He was pushing me hard on the things I didn’t care about enough that I should have cared about.” Looking back at his “26-year-old hotheaded self,” he added that defying what’s important to your boss is “probably not good career advice.” But now, Mosseri insisted that he has learned how to better balance what he holds dear at work with whatever’s at the top of Zuckerberg’s priority list.  “Mark is very consistent,” Mosseri said on the podcast The Colin and Samir Show. “He is always going to hold a really, really high bar. He’s always going to push you really, really hard. He’s always going to have very high expectations. “You can, when you’ve worked with anybody for long enough, start to anticipate what their feedback’s going to be, what they care about.  “So as long as you make sure you embrace that in addition to embracing whatever you believe in and how you want to approach the role, you have to find that balance. “With Mark, I have that balance most of the time.” Before joining the tech world, Mosseri had the far less glamorous experience of washing dishes and waiting tables.  He graduated from New York University in 2005 and worked as a product designer and UI engineer for the now defunct company TokBox for two years before getting his big break at Facebook. In the 16 years since, he’s scaled the company’s ranks from the bottom to the top, and he credits being a jack of all trades and “reliable” for his success. “I wasn’t very good, I just had a lot of range,” Mosseri said. “I’m decent at a strangely large number of things—and I think that has really helped me.” He was made head of Instagram following the resignation of the app’s founders in 2018, six years after Zuckerberg bought it for $1 billion, and has been unofficially placed in charge of Meta’s new darling, Threads.  On his transition from product design to management, he continued: “Being more of a generalist is more advantageous. “Being an executive is a very generalist type of role, so my career really accelerated when I leaned into that and was honest about what I wasn’t good at.” Fortune reached Meta for comment. Meta’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, similarly worked his way up the ranks.  Having started out as one of Facebook’s first engineers before being plucked out for promotion after promotion, Bosworth said the difference between him and his peers wasn’t simply who could work the hardest.  In an interview on Lenny’s Podcast, Bosworth revealed that he worked 120 hours a week and didn’t sleep more than four hours consecutively a day for two years. “There are other people who do the exact same thing, maybe they worked harder, maybe they were smarter, maybe they did better,” he cautioned. “And it didn’t play out for them and it’s a big sacrifice.” Instead, like Mosseri, he credits his success with putting himself forward for projects that are important to his boss and a result ending up under the “Eye of Sauron”—otherwise known as Zuckerberg’s beady watch.  “If it’s the most important thing, you’re going to get a smaller piece. Everyone wants to be there,” Bosworth advised. “Get the piece that you can crush, kill, do a great job at, and grow from.” The Facebook veteran also recommended volunteering to help out in an area that the company isn’t paying a lot of attention to, but is still really important to the business. “As an executive, when there’s a huge dam holding up the floodwaters, you respect the heck out of that person who is holding that dam up.” Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office.

73,"Trân Nguyễn, The Associated Press","Big-box chains are funding a California ballot measure to crack down on retail theft, setting up clash with progressive lawmakers",https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/retail-theft-shoplifting-big-box-chains-california-ballot-measure-progressive-policies/,State lawmakers are trying to preserve progressive policies and stay away from putting more people behind bars.,2024-06-15T14:59:29Z,"With retail theft increasing, California Democratic leadership is clashing with a coalition of law enforcement and business groups in a fierce political fight over how to crack down on the problem. State lawmakers are trying to preserve progressive policies and stay away from putting more people behind bars. The two most likely paths under consideration this year are a ballot initiative to create harsher penalties for repeat offenders, and a legislative package aimed at making it easier to go after professional crime rings. Leaders behind the two efforts have accused one another of misleading voters and being unwilling to work toward a compromise. Both sides agree on the need to crack down, especially on large-scale thefts in which groups of people brazenly rush into stores and take goods in plain sight. At the center of the escalating political fight is Proposition 47, a progressive ballot measure passed by voters in 2014 that reduced certain theft and drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors — in part to mitigate overcrowding in jails and prisons. That includes nonviolent property crimes such as thefts under $950. It has made it harder to arrest and punish people who shoplift, law enforcement said. Researchers told lawmakers there’s no evidence linking the proposition to increased violent crime rates. A coalition of district attorneys and businesses, mostly funded by big box retailers, is pushing for an initiative to bring harsh penalties for shoplifting and drug offenses. It would make theft of any amount a felony if the person already has two theft convictions. Possession of fentanyl would also become a felony, and those with multiple drug charges would be ordered to get treatment. The ballot measure would still need to be certified by the Secretary of State before it could be placed on the ballot later this month. California’s Democratic leadership, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, wants to keep the tough-on-crime measure off the November ballot. They worry the ballot measure’s proposal would disproportionately criminalize low-income people and those with substance use issues rather than target ringleaders who hire large groups of people to steal goods for them to resell online. Instead, lawmakers are fast-tracking a legislative package of 14 bills that would go after organized online reseller schemes and auto thieves, and provide funding for drug addiction counselors. These proposals could become laws as early as this month. If voters approve the tough-on-crime ballot initiative, Democratic leaders plan to void most measures in their own legislative package, citing potential conflicts. Lawmakers were short on details about how the two paths conflict earlier this week. Later, they said they fear if both efforts succeed, law enforcement would be able to stack penalties and send more people to jails, leading to mass incarceration and overcrowded jails. About a third of the measures in the package pose possible legal conflicts with the proposals in the ballot initiative, according to lawmakers. The ballot initiative campaign accused lawmakers of holding the proposals hostage to break up the coalition. Local district attorneys who backed the ballot campaign said both efforts could work together, with the ballot measure overriding the legislative package in case of legal conflicts. Backers of the ballot initiative said they’re still open to working with Democratic leadership but will only consider any solutions that involve rolling back Proposition 47. “We still stand ready to sit down with anybody in leadership to talk about the measure, but I don’t want to compromise,” Greg Totten, a retired district attorney and a leader of the ballot initiative campaign, said during a news conference this week. Newsom and Democratic leaders have until June 27 to negotiate to get the initiative off the ballot. Meanwhile, lawmakers have plans to deliver the legislative package to Newsom’s desk by next week for signing, despite growing concerns from moderate Democrats. “When you look at the package that we put together, it’s very comprehensive and it addresses a number of details in the existing framework of the law,” Assemblymember Rick Zbur, author of a retail theft bill, told reporters. “It was never intended to be something that was stacked on to a ballot measure that removed the underpinnings of the basic law that we were trying to reform.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

74,Jason Ma,"More Americans are suddenly planning to have babies and buy new homes, even as consumer sentiment sinks",https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/economic-outlook-new-baby-expectations-fertility-home-buying-consumer-sentiment/,The share of respondents who said that they or their partner was expecting/trying to have/adopt a baby hit the highest level since February 2023.,2024-06-15T18:59:46Z,"The latest consumer sentiment gauge suggests more gloom about the economy, even as it remains strong, but another indicator may belie that weak reading.  More Americans are planning to have a baby in the next year, according to a Bank of America survey, a possible sign that there’s at least enough optimism about the future to bring another life into this world. In a research note on Wednesday, BofA said the share of respondents who said that they or their partner was expecting/trying to have/adopt a baby over the next 12 months rose to 12.4% in June from 11.5% in May. The latest reading is the highest since February 2023 and also up sharply from less than 8% in February of this year. The June bump isn’t necessarily seasonal either. The BofA survey shows that this month’s reading was higher than the one for June 2023 and June 2021 but lower than June 2022. And as expectations rise for bigger households, that could be helping to drive the desire to find a new home too. The share of respondents who said they plan to buy a home in the next 12 months was 24.0% in June, roughly flat from May’s 24.3% but a big surge from the sub-20% prints throughout the second half of 2023 and first half 2024. That’s even after mortgage rates spiked earlier this year when signs of sticky inflation dampened hopes for imminent rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment gauge fell to the lowest level in seven months, plunging to 65.6 in June from 69.1 in May and defying forecasts for an improvement to 72. To be sure, expressed intentions for having a baby are different from actual fertility rates, which have been falling for years and hit a record low in the U.S. last year of 1.62 births per woman. That’s as more Gen Zers report they only plan to have one kid while sperm counts have been in decline for decades in what some call a global “spermpocalypse.” Other developed economies have been seeing similar trends, which could weigh on their growth potential. Low fertility has alarmed governments in East Asia so much that they have rolled out more financial incentives, which have so far made little impact. The decline has also alarmed Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has famously called the world’s rapidly falling birth rate “one of the biggest risks to civilization.” “So many people, including smart people, think that there are too many people in the world and think that the population is growing out of control. It’s completely the opposite,” he said in 2021. “Please look at the numbers—if people don’t have more children, civilization is going to crumble, mark my words.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

75,Alena Botros,"The $200,000 starter home is going extinct",https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/housing-market-starter-home-going-extinct-affordability-havens/,"There are some “affordability havens” for now, though, according to Realtor.com.",2024-06-15T13:15:00Z,"More than a year ago, Ali Wolf, Zonda’s chief economist, told Fortune the $300,000 starter home was going extinct. At the time, the housing data and consultancy firm found the share of projects under $300,000 was declining all across the country, and so was affordability.  “We’re creating, inadvertently, a renter society not because of choice but because of force,” Wolf said. Rent isn’t cheap either, even though some predict renting will be cheaper than buying for years. Even so, in Wolf’s mind, $300,000 homes should have been attainable. But everything from the cost of building materials to land availability to the lack of housing to regulation made it so much harder to build affordable homes—and a lot of it stemmed from the pandemic-fueled housing boom. A Realtor.com report released Thursday seemed to confirm the fall-off in the number of affordable homes. “Over the past several years, the number of homes under $200,000 has gone from around half of all sales to less than a quarter of sales in 2023,” it said, calling the statistic, “stark proof of shrinking affordability across the country.”  Affordability is shot, that’s no secret; this is just one more indicator of that trend. Home prices skyrocketed during the pandemic: They’re 45% higher now than they were before, according to Zillow, and the typical monthly mortgage payment is 115% higher since that time. And, since there’s not enough homes to go around, prices haven’t really fallen. (There are some metropolitan areas where home prices have declined from a year earlier, but it’s less than a handful—nationally, home prices hit their ninth all-time high in the past year). In any case, the median sales price of houses sold in the country is $420,800, and the average weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.95%.  ‘Where all the $200k homes are hiding’  There are some signs that home-price appreciation is slowing, and mortgage rates are coming down, but it might not feel fast enough for anyone who wants to buy a home. Still, Realtor.com analyzed listing data from the first week of this month and compiled a list of what it called “affordability havens…where all the $200k homes are hiding.” Let me tell you, not a single one is in sunny California—or even Texas, its cheaper, and sometimes more popular, counterpart.  Median list price: $149,350Number of listings under $200,000: 239Percentage of listings under $200,000: 85% Median list price: $175,000Number of listings under $200,000: 404Percentage of listings under $200,000: 70% Median list price: $138,600Number of listings under $200,000: 214Percentage of listings under $200,000: 70% Median list price: $90,000Number of listings under $200,000: 1,586Percentage of listings under $200,000: 64% Median list price: $161,194Number of listings under $200,000: 213Percentage of listings under $200,000: 68% Median list price: $114,500Number of listings under $200,000: 98Percentage of listings under $200,000: 80% Median list price: $104,000Number of listings under $200,000: 245Percentage of listings under $200,000: 64% Median list price: $143,950Number of listings under $200,000: 133Percentage of listings under $200,000: 68% Median list price: $164,950Number of listings under $200,000: 153Percentage of listings under $200,000: 66% Median list price: $135,475Number of listings under $200,000: 512Percentage of listings under $200,000: 61% Here’s the thing, though: These starter homes might not be $200,000 forever. “These are still some of the most affordable places in the country, but they’ve seen a lot of price growth over the last year or so,” Hannah Jones, a Realtor.com senior economic analyst, said in the report.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

76,Niamh Rowe,ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood says digital wallet wars will be a ‘winner-take-most’ opportunity,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/14/ark-invests-cathie-wood-says-digital-wallet-wars-will-be-a-winner-take-most-opportunity/,"In conversation with Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong at the company’s State of Crypto Summit on Thursday, Wood argued that digital wallets could be a race where one winner takes all.",2024-06-14T06:05:19Z,"Cathie Wood, CEO of investment management firm ARK Invest, thinks the digital wallet industry is set to consolidate. Amid a decline in traditional banking services, whoever monopolizes the wallet market stands to wield significant power in the financial sector, she says. In conversation with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at the company’s State of Crypto Summit on Thursday, Wood argued that there is a new generation of consumers who want a digital wallet to be their one-stop shop for all online payments. Citing the absence of traditional banks in the digital wallet space, “this truly is a winner-take-most opportunity,” she said. Wood made repeated reference to WeChat Pay—the digital wallet from Chinese social media giant WeChat, which lets users make mobile payments and online transactions—noting it has set the “model” for how the market will evolve. WeChat Pay functions like a “bank branch in your pocket,” she said, offering all forms of financial services and commerce. Since its initial release in 2013, the app has accumulated over 1.13 billion active users. Along with Alibaba’s Alipay, the two applications account for over 90% of all mobile payments in China. Digital wallets can be loosely described as phone applications that enable peer-to-peer transactions, real-world purchases, and online payments. Major players include PayPal, its subsidiary Venmo, Zelle, and Cash App, which are all digitally native with no brick-and-mortar branches.  But the services offered by these fintech companies are fast usurping traditional banking. According to Worldpay’s Global Payments 2024 report, digital wallets accounted for half of all e-commerce transaction value last year. Citing a generation coming of age that may never see the four walls of a traditional bank, Armstrong said he wants crypto to be treated as a serious contender in the digital wallet race. Like Wood, he predicted that one’s phone will exist interchangeably with one’s wallet, and consumer demand for a single financial account “where they get paid, make purchases, and send money,” will become the norm. Despite Coinbase’s reputation as an exchange first and foremost, Armstrong noted “the real potential in innovation [in crypto], comes from these peer-to-peer transactions.” Crypto’s presence in the digital wallet space is growing. In April, PayPal announced users can make fee-free global transfers of its stablecoin PYUSD, while Cash App has let users buy and sell Bitcoin since 2018. Last week, Coinbase debuted its Smart Wallet, a self-custodial crypto wallet that replaces the laborious recovery phrases, apps, and extensions typically associated with accessing DeFi wallets that keeps some users away, with biometric data, such as Face ID and fingerprints. On top of this, the Smart Wallet can draw funds from both the user’s self-custodial wallet and their Coinbase account balance. In a competitive, saturated digital wallet market, Armstrong touted “interoperability” as DeFi’s comparative advantage. In other words, a Coinbase wallet transaction doesn’t need to be met with another Coinbase wallet, unlike, say, PayPal. The CEO likened payments to flowing water—it follows the path of least resistance. In lieu of that, he predicted that a quarter of global GDP will be on crypto rails—the term for payment platforms that support the transfer of digital assets—within a decade. Armstrong concluded with an ambitious, final goal: for Coinbase wallets to be the “primary financial account” for the next generation. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

77,"Vivek Wadhwa, Alex Salkever",Why a ‘heartland visa’ for skilled workers could be the answer to America's immigration debate,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/heartland-visa-skilled-workers-americas-immigration-debate/,It would make it easier for immigrants to obtain residency if they spend 6 years in parts of the U.S. that once enjoyed prosperity but now lag behind.,2024-06-13T15:48:31Z,"Vivek Wadhwa is an academic, entrepreneur, and author. Alex Salkever is a Silicon Valley technology executive who has advised dozens of technology companies on strategy and go-to-market. When we wrote The Immigrant Exodus 11 years ago, the imperative to keep the U.S. globally competitive was less clear. China had not yet emerged as a hostile competitor. Artificial intelligence had not accelerated to become a paradigm shift that kills jobs and upends industries. The long-term innovation price of hollowing out the U.S. industrial base was poorly understood by techies and economists alike. But even then, we knew that turning away the best and brightest immigrants would dim the economic and technological future of America. It was painfully obvious. Today, the situation has barely improved. Some limitations on permanent and long-term visas for skilled immigrants in science and technology have eased—but only a bit. The political realities that have held back skilled immigration remain unchanged. The primary local beneficiaries of eased skilled immigration in technology are the West Coast and East Coast cities that are deep blue and companies and industries that are already perceived as wealthy. Immigration reform by executive order has targeted artificial intelligence, which primarily benefits those regions, too. Even with this restrictive reality, the U.S. is more and more reliant on foreign-born workers for STEM jobs. The spurious argument that bringing in more skilled immigrants reduces the wages of existing skilled workers is trotted out repeatedly. There are also other sorts of unhealthy roadblocks, such as the congressionally imposed cap on federal support for graduate medical education through the Medicare program. This cap bottlenecks our ability to train doctors domestically after medical school and plays a major role in the massive physician shortage facing the country. A novel immigration idea could cut through the political red tape and potentially open a path to greater economic prosperity and a heartland revival. Called the “heartland visa,” this relatively new proposal would make it far easier for skilled immigrants to come and work in this country and obtain permanent residency if they spend at least six years working in the so-called “heartland”—effectively, the Rust Belt and other parts of the United States that once enjoyed industrial prosperity but now lag behind the coasts. Applicants who already have a job offer from a company in those regions would have an expedited path to obtaining both an initial work visa and a green card. This proposal echoes Canada’s wise immigration policy, which empowers regions of the country to sponsor visa applicants possessing skills specifically needed by that region’s employers. This approach aligns multiple political stars to make passage far more likely. It focuses on net new job creation in regions where there are fewer skilled jobs. The heartland visa is also designed to revitalize areas that have not had the economic tailwinds of Big Tech, where skilled immigration would likely have a larger multiplier effect. To make the effect even greater, give the highest priority to workers coming to staff startups—the type of company that adds the most jobs and drives the most economic growth. It would also allow for better regional specialization—think electric vehicle factories in South Carolina next to battery production plants or new material science startups close to steel plants. Such a policy would magnify the ongoing revitalization of many beautiful heartland cities and towns that retain the bones of classic homes and buildings and remain far less expensive than their coastal counterparts. If successful, the heartland visa would drive economic development, technology innovation, and national resilience all in one fell swoop. The U.S. remains the world’s most attractive destination for skilled immigrants. Its economy continues to outperform the rest of the world. While China has made great competitive inroads against us, the U.S.’s open culture and embrace of entrepreneurship still make us the greatest melting pot ever created. These talents have driven our economy and will continue to drive it to great heights—if we only let the best and brightest come to America.

78,Prarthana Prakash,"Here's how the U.K. election front-runners Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak differ on taxation, healthcare, housing and education",https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/13/uk-general-election-front-runners-keir-starmer-rishi-sunak-labour-conservatives-manifesto-taxation-healthcare-housing-education/,The two U.K. front-runners from the Labour and Conservative Parties will go head-to-head in less than a month from now.,2024-06-13T15:39:40Z,"It’s a big few weeks for U.K. politics as the countdown (now at 21 days) to the general election is on.  This week, the front-running parties in the election—the Labour and Conservative (or Tory) parties—launched their manifestos. Each group revealed its plans if elected into power, including on taxation, health care reform, housing, and education.  Here’s a look at the top policies from each party’s manifesto, where they stand on these key topics, and the different directions they take.    The two parties differ the most on this topic, with the Tories wanting to slash taxes, while the Labour Party wants to hike them. Conservatives: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged over £17.2 billion ($22 billion) in tax cuts as the tax burden has climbed to its highest since World War II as a share of the economy. The measure will be funded by a sizable welfare spending cut and any savings accumulated from cracking down on tax evasion.  The tax cuts include a reduction in National Insurance contributions, which could cost the Treasury about £10 billion ($12.8 billion) in lost tax income. Labour: Unlike Sunak’s plan, Labour’s Keir Starmer wants to raise about £8.5 billion ($10.9 billion) through tax increases such as VAT and windfall tax hikes, in addition to tapering down tax breaks for non-domiciled individuals. The taxes target different areas from what Sunak outlined, and Starmer made a point to delineate the two things. Starmer wants to cap corporate taxes at 25%. Relatedly, the party wants to close a loophole that allows private equity managers to pay a lower rate of capital gains tax on investment returns.    “We will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT,” Starmer said when launching his manifesto Thursday.  Conservatives: The Tories’ measures are targeted at making education more accessible, like introducing free schools for children with special needs. They also want to increase school spending in “real terms per pupil,” Sunak said. The party announced a more nuanced plan to raise the threshold at which families must pay tax for childcare benefits. The Tories said in the manifesto that they’re eyeing mandatory National Service “for all school leavers at 18, with the choice between a competitive placement in the military or civic service roles.” Labour: Starmer, too, has many measures aimed at the education system and U.K. youth. For one, he wants to recruit 6,500 new teachers to overhaul the education system, funded by tax breaks offered to private schools. Separately, the Labour Party also plans to lower the voting age threshold and support parents with free breakfasts for children at primary schools.  Conservatives: The Conservatives set out ways they’d help boost first-time homeownership. They also want to introduce a so-called triple lock plus system guaranteeing that pensioners’ state tax isn’t subject to any tax levies and that they receive tax-free allowances.   Labour: Labour has pledged to invest more pension money in U.K. companies. To support that effort, it plans to set up a National Wealth Fund with £7.3 billion ($9.3 billion) to attract private sector investment in addition to public investment.   Conservatives: The Conservatives plan to increase NHS spending above inflation to expand the recruitment of nurses and doctors. The group also plans to spend £2.4 billion ($3 billion) on training more medical professionals by the end of the next Parliament and wants to address the “sick note culture” by offering more mental health services.   While it’s unclear how they plan to achieve this, the Tories also want to introduce artificial intelligence in hospital operations and improve NHS productivity.     Labour: Starmer’s plan is to significantly cut NHS wait times—with 40,000 new appointments opening up each week. The effort, he said on Thursday, would be funded by doubling down on tax avoidance cases and “non-dom loopholes.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

79,Chloe Berger,NBA icon Jerry West believed there were 3 types of people in the world—but only one of them destined for success,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/jerry-west-success-types-of-people-career-advice-commencement-speech/,"West shared his tips to success in a 2008 commencement speech, noting that there are fighters, floaters, and flee-ers in this world.",2024-06-13T20:54:28Z,"The clock was ticking, a crowd full of eyes on him, witnessing a split second moment of triumph or defeat. “Success or failure was in his hands,” West said of his childhood imagined-self while speaking to the 2008 graduating class at West Virginia University.  “He couldn’t float; he couldn’t depend on someone else. He couldn’t flee; there was no one else to turn to,” he added, recognizing that it must have been a “strange sight” to see a young kid cheer themselves. But that’s what it took to get to the status of a sport’s legend both on and off the courts.  “I simply would not let myself fail,” West remembers of the game he played out in his mind, which would prove foundational when he became a professional athlete ad then a coach.  West passed away on Wednesday, leaving behind a legacy as a Hall of Famer, record-holder, both coach and player for the Los Angeles Lakers, and high-powered executive. You might recognize West without knowing it, as his image is widely-regarded as the inspiration for the NBA logo itself.  During his commencement speech, West noted he was once told there are three types of people in the world—fighters, flee-ers, and floaters—and urged everyone to follow his intentionally placed heavy footsteps, and strive to be fighters. The life of a fighter The former basketball figure had a difficult childhood and dove into the game, in part, as a reprieve from his troubles. Dreaming was key to his success, and pushing for said dream was foundational as he notes those imaginary games were his “way of becoming a fighter.” But that’s not everyone.  Some people are floaters, defined by West as someone who “drifts through life taking things in, going with the current, sharing in success and failure, but seldom determining his own fate.” While these breezy people can avoid pitfalls and accomplish a lot simply by placing themselves in the right spot, their wins are’t truly a feat, he says.  “In my mind, success without a sense of personal accomplishment isn’t success at all. It is merely positioning,” West added, explaining that floaters often see prowess as a financial thing. In his eyes, though, “money is a measure of buying power, but seldom is it a measure of success.” Flee-ers follow beneath the floaters, said West, explaining that these people “will jump from job to job, will run from challenge and opportunity alike.” Likely to shirk accountability and blame others, they really only hurt themselves but can deter a floater, West said. While they might bring a floater down as “misery needs company,” a fleer-er will find that a fighter is their “worst nightmare.” “A flee-er and a fighter are the opposite ends of the spectrum of self-determination,” West added, claiming that “a fighter is a person that will succeed.” They’re not all that dissimilar from floaters and flee-ers; rather, they’re propelled and differentiated by “a goal, a dream, a vision.”  Looking back on his own life, he remembered his “driveaway basketball games were all about achieving dreams,” which then expanded when got to university and recognized that while he “had a God-given gift, that gift was not going to be enough.” West’s life off the court West’s resolve to reach his objectives, and the resolve of other fighters, were upheld by three traits: character, determination, and resolve. These pillars “help you stand fast as a fighter, to step above the floater, and to surge beyond the grapes of the fleer-er.” Ultimately, they’re “the virtues that you can drive to success,” he added.     Those traits were tested when West left the court and his goals shifted, or became less clear. West said he experienced “self-doubt,” and realized he had to continue to push through with a similar no-failure outlook he had as a player.  In reality, being one of the three prototypes is not as immutable as it might seem. “The path to success is never without its bumps and challenges,” West acknowledged. “These challenges will create internal battles. These bumps will also create new and exciting opportunities.” In navigating these bumps “you will again need to draw upon your character, determination and resolve.” And with each fork in the road, “you will face a new group of floaters, flee-ers and fighters. In fact, you will again have to decide which type of person you are.” In the path to success, there’s bound to be constant obstacles: “Each day you need to get up and decide what kind of person you are because each day is an opportunity to succeed or fail,” West noted. Harkening back to his time on the court, and countless times before that on his driveway, West knew he had it in him to choose to keep believing in himself.“As my life on the court ended, I decided that I was going to be a fighter. I decided I was again going to lead. I didn’t know how, but I knew what was in me, so I knew that I could,” he said. And lead he did, guiding the Lakers to six championships, becoming a two-time NBA executive of the year, and proving himself a fighter until the very end. Basketball was once just a dream for Jerry West. Shooting hoops for hours in his driveway as a kid, the ball clutched in his hands, his fantasy would inevitably end the same way each time.  The clock was ticking, a crowd full of eyes on him, witnessing a split second moment of triumph or defeat. “Success or failure was in his hands,” West said of his childhood imagined-self while speaking to the 2008 graduating class at West Virginia University.  “He couldn’t float; he couldn’t depend on someone else.

80,Jennifer Barnes,"I’m a CEO and 12 of my employees are in ‘flextirement.’ With boomers opting not to retire, the arrangement will become more common",https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/boomers-flextirement-retirement-careers/,"Flextirement provides a cost-effective way to attract experienced employees and retain them, says Optima Office CEO Jennifer Barnes.",2024-06-13T13:02:27Z,"Jennifer Barnes is CEO of Optima Office. For as long as I’ve been a business owner, the narrative surrounding the baby-boomer generation was all about the coming retirement wave. We were promised a mass exodus from the workforce, a seismic shift that would leave companies scrambling to fill the void. At Optima Office, an outsourced accounting and HR company I founded almost six years ago, we began preparing for the shift in the workforce by focusing on high retention. We felt that listening to the needs of our employees was one way to do that. After speaking with some of our baby-boomer employees, I realized that many of them loved their work—and mentoring the younger team members—so much that they didn’t want to hang up their hat when they turned 65. That generation was led to believe that retirement was the dream that they had worked so hard to achieve, but upon reflection, the stark transition from full-time work to full-time retirement felt more like a demotion than a reward.  While at many companies the path to retirement is a rigid ladder—climb to the top of your career, hit a designated age, and then retire—this one-size-fits-all approach often leaves retirees grappling with financial anxieties, identity shifts, and a sudden loss of purpose. Some forward-thinking companies are reimagining retirement with a new approach, and I decided we would create an alternative option at Optima Office: flextirement.  Flextirement is a flexible work arrangement designed to ease the transition between full-time employment and retirement with flexible hours, reduced workloads, and phased approaches to leaving the workforce. This bridge offers a lower-stress transition by easing into retirement by working 10, 20, or 30 hours instead of 40, allows flextirees to adjust to an income shift, explore hobbies, and spend more time with loved ones, all while gradually letting go of work. For most of our flextirees, working part-time is a privilege. For others, it may be a financial necessity. According to a Bankrate survey, 56% of workers in the U.S. believe they’re behind on their retirement savings. For business owners like myself, there are many advantages. Seasoned employees, when transitioning to a flextirement role, can become invaluable mentors for younger colleagues. Plus, as we know well, as an outsourced HR company, finding and training replacements for senior employees can be expensive. Flextirement provides a cost-effective way to attract experienced employees and retain them—and their institutional knowledge. I’ve always advocated for a very flexible work environment, and Optima Office offered flextirement from day one. We need highly skilled resources such as CFOs, and I’ve found an incredible talent pool that is near retirement or coming out of retirement to work part-time. It’s important to note, however, that we don’t just give our employees nearing retirement a flexible place to work; we let people of all ages work the hours that make sense for them. In fact, there are only a dozen of our 100 employees who work more than 40 hours a week, and that is by choice.  Flextirement has had an incredibly positive impact for our team at Optima Office. These seasoned veterans, the ones with decades of experience under their belts, didn’t have to completely step away. They craved a balance—the intellectual stimulation of their careers without the full-time commitment. And for us as a company, the benefits were undeniable, reaping the value of their experience and know-how. Today, 12 of our employees are on a flextirement plan. They work anywhere from 12 to 25 hours a week, mentor junior employees, and contribute to specific projects where their expertise shines. They are able to make their own schedule and spend time with grandkids, but also give their many years of expertise to the companies who need them. Beyond technical expertise, our flextirees bring a wealth of soft skills honed over decades of experience. They understand team dynamics, the art of negotiation, and the importance of clear communication. These are invaluable lessons for our younger workforce. Our flextirees are demonstrably happier and more engaged. They have the time for their personal lives, hobbies, and families, yet they remain connected to the work they love. This, in turn, fosters a company culture that prioritizes well-being and work-life balance. And, as I mentioned, it isn’t just boomers that get this benefit; I’ve always let our team work part-time if that is what fits their lifestyle, so there is no resentment from younger employees.  To implement this, you could start by offering part-time roles to the older generation—start in areas you need them most! It could even be in positions such as assistant work or administrative. Or it could be in highly skilled areas such as the C Suite. Be open-minded when speaking with candidates. Outside of flextirement, consider how many parents want a more gradual transition back from maternity/paternity leave or want to work part-time while their children are young. As a mom of a toddler, I have learned this firsthand and have since also made it an official policy at Optima Office policies to provide additional flexibility to parents so they know they have our support to adjust their work schedule in different stages of their parenting journey. Many of our baby-boomer flextirees—now working part-time in order to take on a more active role in their grandchildren’s lives—wish they had this arrangement when they were new parents as well.  As the baby-boomer generation continues to redefine retirement, flextirement is poised to become more commonplace. Companies that embrace this model will reap the benefits of a wealth of experience, knowledge transfer, and a happier, more engaged workforce. Here at Optima Office, we’re not just weathering the storm of a changing workforce; we’re riding the wave. Flextirement isn’t a concession, it’s a nontraditional approach to retirement with advantages for companies and their employees.  As more companies embrace this innovative approach, the traditional retirement cliff might just become a gentle, flexible slope where everyone can find their own comfortable landing point.

81,"The Associated Press, Tom Krisher, Irina Ivanova","'We're starting a new book': Elon Musk runs victory lap after shareholders approve $45b pay package, move to Texas",https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-pay-tesla-vote-approved/,Shareholders approved a record CEO pay package as well as moving Tesla to Texas from Delaware.,2024-06-13T21:24:38Z,"Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved the restoration of CEO Elon Musk’s massive pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge, based on preliminary results of the company’s annual meeting. They also approved Tesla’s bid to move its corporate headquarters from Delaware to Texas, which Musk announced shortly after the February verdict. Musk took a victory lap on stage in Austin immediately after the results were announced, telling those gathered, “We’re not just opening up a new chapter—we’re starting a new book.”  “It’s going to be the best book,” he said later in the sometimes-rambling speech. “It’s going to be next-level.” Tesla previously said said in a regulatory filing that stockholders were set to approve Musk’s pay, valued around $44.9 billion, by a wide margin. The company sought the votes after a Delaware judge threw out the pay package in January. Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick determined that Tesla deceived shareholders when the all stock compensation was approved in 2018, so Musk is not entitled to the landmark package, which was worth nearly $56 billion before a stock slide this year. Shares of Tesla closed Thursday up just under 3% at $182.47. The stock is down about 25% this year. The approval of his pay almost guarantees that Musk will remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla’s future. Musk has threatened on X to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn’t get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk’s xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. According to Musk, early indications suggest that shareholders also back a move to relocate Tesla’s legal home to Texas, and out of Delaware. The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court’s oversight and possibly from McCormick’s ruling. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark pay package. Multiple institutional investors had come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla’s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don’t announce their votes or wouldn’t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California’s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk’s pay “based on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.” In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. “Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us — and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard — as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,” she wrote. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk’s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won’t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week’s shareholder vote, they wrote. In an order denying Tornetta’s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla’s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. “The defendants’ statements give me great comfort,” she wrote. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said he expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick’s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

82,Sydney Lake,Commercial real estate bargain hunters are snagging offices for ‘extreme’ discounts up to 70%,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/commercial-real-estate-office-bargain-extreme-discounts/,"“Office is clearly in the worst shape versus the other property types,” one executive says.",2024-06-13T16:12:29Z,"It’s no secret that commercial real estate has been struggling the past few years. The sector is still reeling from the pandemic, which pushed more professionals to work from home and consumers to shop and dine at home. As a result, office vacancy rates reached a 30-year high around 18% in 2023, and companies both large and small majorly shed space to adjust to new remote- and hybrid-working norms. Some even terminated their leases early. Now, commercial real estate bargain hunters are snagging space for steep discounts up to 70% off, according to several reports from commercial real estate information company CoStar. “There has certainly been a trend of commercial buildings being scooped up at extreme discounts,” David Almaraz, a real estate attorney at Grant Shenon in Los Angeles with more than 20 years of experience, tells Fortune. “In the current state, commercial real estate is in trouble. People don’t want to go into the office anymore, and the days of putting on a suit and tie and commuting 40 minutes to sit in a cubicle doesn’t appeal to the average worker anymore.” Some examples of heavily discounted commercial real estate sales include an office building in downtown San Jose, which sold for about $56 million less than what it did in 2017, according to CoStar, and a Manhattan office building that sold at a roughly 67% discount, a Bloomberg report shows. Empire Capital Holdings and Namdar Realty Group purchased the property for less than $50 million, according to Bloomberg, but Related Fund Management paid a whopping $153 million for it in 2018.  While commercial real estate as a whole is struggling, most of these steep discounts have been seen in the office sector. “Office is clearly in the worst shape versus the other property types,” Joe Iacono, CEO of commercial real estate finance firm Crescit Capital Strategies, tells Fortune. “Other asset classes are suffering from higher interest rates, expense inflation—in particular insurance and wages—and a flattening of rent growth. Office has to contend with all these factors plus significant vacancy and lack of demand.” The steep discounts offered on commercial properties is just the latest sign of a struggling sector. Another one of the most damning figures that illustrates the doom headed for commercial real estate is the total value of mortgages that will mature in 2024. By Mortgage Bankers Association projections, $929 billion of the $4.7 trillion outstanding commercial mortgages held by lenders and investors will come due this year, according to a report released in February. This will be troublesome for tenants looking to refinance at a higher interest-rate environment. While many commercial properties have lost value during the past few years, not all are being offered at the steep 60% to 70% discounts mentioned previously. Moody’s looked at various price indices that measure changes on repeat sales of the same properties over time and found that office values have come down about 20% to 30% since their 2021 peak. However, other measures imply a 30% to 40% discount, Moody’s head of commercial real estate economic analysis, Kevin Fagan, tells Fortune.  “Some office properties are seeing significant discounts to their prior valuations or sale prices, but 70% is not the norm,” Fagan says. “While sale volume is low and price discovery has been a big challenge for CRE stakeholders over the past year or two, the sales that have occurred have offered a very mixed picture.” Indeed, other measures based on market prices of public REITs indicate as much as a 60% peak-to-trough decline, he adds. It’s also important to note the intricacies of individual commercial real estate sales, especially when it comes to properties that are massively discounted. Take the example of the Manhattan office building at 1740 Broadway. There had been a “battle” between bondholders and the special servicer (who specialize in managing and resolving distressed loans) on the deal after Blacksone turned over the keys to the property, Fagan says, which resulted in delays and a need to get the property sold quickly.  “All of those issues led to a fire sale situation on the asset, versus an orderly sale that would maximize recovery value,” Fagan says. Another such example was a property in Fort Worth, Texas, where multiple reports in May indicated that the Burnett Plaza building had sold for $12.3 million, less than one-tenth of the $137.5 million paid just three years earlier.  “The reality of the situation was much different,” Fagan explains, because the media reports only addressed part of the sale. The foreclosure auction was only for the mezzanine loan on the property, which are typically just used for acquisitions or development projects. The first mortgage on the building, which is estimated at $83 million, is still in place for the building.  “So while the winning bid was $12.3 million, the buyer is also responsible for the $83 million first mortgage, bringing the acquisition to just over $95 million,” Fagan says. “This is still a steep decline from $137.5 million in just three years, but 33% is a long way from the 90%-plus [discount] that was widely reported.” Either way, it’s undeniable that many commercial property owners are having a tough time keeping their buildings occupied.  “Building owners face significant headwinds attracting and retaining tenants, especially in the office category,” Kevan Ventura, a principal in law firm Goldberg Kohn‘s real estate group, tells Fortune. “Simply put, reduced tenant demand contributes to reduced rental income and reduced value. Maintaining occupancy is critical to financial viability.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

83,"Alexandra Semenova, Jessica Menton, Bloomberg",Wall Street forecasters are struggling to keep up with the stock market's relentless surge as the S&P 500 blows past year-end targets,https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/stock-market-outlook-wall-street-forecasters-sp500-year-end-targets/,Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists have boosted their year-end target for the S&P 500 Index for a third time.,2024-06-15T16:10:42Z,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists have boosted their year-end target for the S&P 500 Index for a third time, reflecting Wall Street’s optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the US economy. The bank’s equity strategists led by David Kostin now see the US stock benchmark index finishing the year at 5,600, up from a 5,200 level they predicted in February. The new target implies a roughly 3% advance in the gauge from its Friday close.  Goldman’s upgraded target ties with that from UBS Group AG’s Jonathan Golub and BMO Capital Markets’ Brian Belski for the highest on Wall Street.  The upgrade in the target is “driven by milder-than-average negative earnings revisions and a higher fair value P/E multiple,” Kostin, the firm’s chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  The upgrade comes one month after Kostin reiterated the firm’s 5,200 target, stating there was no further room for upside in the 500-member gauge through December. The firm’s strategists first introduced their 2024 target in November, before raising it in December and again in February. The S&P 500 closed at 5,431.60 on Friday.  While the firm’s strategists maintained their earnings-per-share forecast for 2024 and 2025, they noted that robust earnings growth by the top five megacap technology stocks have offset the “typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.” Kostin also raised the S&P 500’s price-earnings multiple he deems fair to 20.4 from 19.5. Kostin gamed out several other scenarios in which stocks can run even higher than his new baseline forecast. If gains broaden out and lift the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, the main, cap-weighted benchmark could rise another 9% to 5,900 before 2024 closes out. In his most optimistic case, if mega-cap “exceptionalism” persists, the gauge could soar to 6,300 by the end of the year. Conversely, if earnings estimates prove too optimistic or recession fears resurface among investors, the S&P 500 could see a correction of about 13% and fall to 4,700. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

84,"Annie Massa, Bailey Lipschultz, Bloomberg","As 'Roaring Kitty' amasses $262 million in GameStop shares, investors are wondering who's really manipulating the market",https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/gamestop-stock-craze-keith-gill-roaring-kitty-market-manipulation-meme-stock-investing/,"This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation.",2024-06-15T15:51:52Z,"As a renewed bout of GameStop Corp. fever gripped the meme-stock faithful, fans of trading influencer Keith Gill waited for one moment: The day their hero, aka “Roaring Kitty,” aka “Deep F—-ing Value,” would become a billionaire. The notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he’s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company’s shares. With the stock little changed since the early days of its latest mania, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike. The original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core — eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation.  Does posting a meme, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty is the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than Charles Schwab Corp.’s? “The original meme stock craze was us versus them, with ‘them’ being the guys who would short-sell millennials’ favorite companies like GameStop,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “But I’m not sure who ‘them’ is anymore.”  Gill didn’t reply to a request for comment.  The populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: “How is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme?” By Thursday, Gill’s brokerage account snapshots suggested he’d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill’s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.) As Gill’s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock.  All told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead — at the expense of Gill’s retail-trading fans.  “Some of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,” said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. “At some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there’s a lot of danger.” The episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage. A spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment. What’s singular about Gill’s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes & Gray. If Gill’s snapshots are real, that hasn’t obviously been the case, he said.  “You can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he’s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,” it’s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview. To be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks.  Read More: MassMutual Gets ‘Roaring Kitty’ Market Manipulation Suit Tossed “Three years ago this was funny,” said Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William & Mary. “People have become more bothered by this than amused by it, and that to me is an indication that it is unlikely that this behavior will be allowed to continue.” When Gill scheduled a highly anticipated return to YouTube on June 6 without details of what he’d talk about, the stock shot up nearly 50%, adding $16 billion to its market value in a matter of hours.  In the livestream, which garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers, Gill vamped for about an hour against the backdrop of GameStop’s violently fluctuating share price. He seemed to sense the possibility he’d draw more scrutiny from fans, regulators and trading professionals.  “Do I have to be careful what I say here?” he asked. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) reached 977 this year by June 2, higher than the record 941 cases reported for all of last year, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, which has been tracking incidences of the disease since 1999.  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) typically causes swelling and sore throat in children known as “strep throat,” but some types of the bacteria can lead to symptoms developing rapidly, including limb pain and swelling, fever, low blood pressure, that can be followed by necrosis, breathing problems, organ failure and death. People over 50 are more prone to the disease. “Most of the deaths happen within 48 hours,” said Ken Kikuchi, a professor in infectious diseases at Tokyo Women’s Medical University. “As soon as a patient notices swelling in foot in the morning, it can expand to the knee by noon, and they can die within 48 hours.” Other countries have experienced recent outbreaks. In late 2022 at least five European nations reported to the World Health Organization an increase in cases of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease, which includes STSS. The WHO said the rise in cases followed the end of Covid restrictions. At the current rate of infections, the number of cases in Japan could reach 2,500 this year, with a “terrifying” mortality rate of 30%, Kikuchi said. Kikuchi urged people to maintain hand hygiene and to treat any open wounds. He said patients may carry GAS in their intestines, which could contaminate hands through feces.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

86,The Associated Press,"Colliding hot and cold fronts whipsaw the U.S. with extreme heat, flooding, and a chance of snow",https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/extreme-weather-climate-change-severe-heat-wave-warning-flooding-snow/,"While most of the country bakes, parts of Montana have been placed under winter storm watches with a potential for wet snow Monday night.",2024-06-15T21:53:18Z,"After days of intense flooding in Florida, that state and many others are bracing for an intense heat wave, while the Pacific Northwest will experience unseasonably cold weather and there is a potential for late-season snow in the Rocky Mountains early next week. The chaotic weather map includes the possibility of severe thunderstorms developing in between hot and cold fronts. Forecasters said the colliding fronts could lead to areas of flash flooding between eastern Nebraska and northern Wisconsin on Saturday night, as well as strong storms across parts of eastern Montana into North and South Dakota. Meanwhile a plume of tropical moisture will reach the central Gulf Coast during the next couple of days, with heavy rain expected to start Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters said the threat of heavy rains in Florida continues to dissipate, but some thunderstorms could cause local flooding given the already saturated soil. Some areas between Miami and Fort Lauderdale were left underwater in recent days as storms dumped up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) in southern parts of the state. The damaging no-name storm system coincided with the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity. Across much of the southern parts of the country, temperatures were rising Saturday. In Atlanta, where highs were forecast to near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) both weekend days, city officials opened a cooling center to provide relief. The city also postponed a “Family and Friends Field Day” due to the heat. And in the west Texas city of El Paso, Saturday highs were expected to approach 105 F (40.6 C), and the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory through Monday morning for the region. The city has opened five cooling centers that will operate daily until further notice. The National Weather Service said temperatures in Phoenix, where an excessive heat warning was in effect, were forecast to reach 113 F (45 C) on Saturday afternoon. That would be short of the record for June 15 — 115 F (46 C) — set in 2021. Though Arizona is entering its three-month monsoon season, when a shift in wind patterns typically pulls moisture in from the tropical coast of Mexico, no rain is forecast for most of the coming week. “No chances of rain across the state,” National Weather Service meteorologist Ted Whittock said, while noting that there is a 30% chance of showers in southeastern Arizona next Friday. In Tennessee, tens of thousands of revelers at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival braved a hot, sunny weekend to take in more than 150 performances at the 700-acre farm campground and concert venue that hosts the annual event. While medical crews treated various heat-related conditions, some fans constructed elaborate canopy and tent combinations for shade. Others had their sunscreen confiscated upon entry because of restrictions on full-size bottles and aerosol cans, The Tennessean reported. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and New England will likely peak in the mid- to upper 90s next week, which is “nothing to sneeze at even in the middle of the summer, let alone this early in the summer,” National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said. The high humidity will make it feel even hotter in many places, he added. Last year the U.S. had the most heat waves — abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days — since 1936. In the South and Southwest, last year was the worst on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Next week’s heat wave will ramp up Sunday in the center of the country before spreading eastward, the National Weather Service said, with some areas likely to see daily record highs. The heat wave could last into the weekend in many places. While most of the country bakes, parts of Montana have been placed under winter storm watches with a potential for wet snow Monday night. Churchill said the northwestern cold front is connected to the heat wave because one extreme is often accompanied by the other. Heavy rain and sporadic thunderstorms were expected in western Washington into Saturday evening. In Edmonds, where an outdoor art festival was underway, the National Weather Service warned in the early afternoon that a stronger thunderstorm was headed in. Hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts in the state’s Cascade Mountains and Montana’s Rocky Mountains were also likely to see heavy snow at lower elevations. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather watch for north-central Idaho and western Montana from Sunday through Tuesday. The agency warned of a hypothermia risk and said backcountry roads could become impassible due to the expected snowfall and possible downed trees and branches. As much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of heavy, wet snow was expected in the mountains around Missoula, Montana, and as much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) was predicted for higher elevations around Glacier National Park. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

87,"Matthew Miller, Julie Fine, Bloomberg",Meet the co-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks: A casino mogul trying to bring gambling to a reluctant state,https://fortune.com/2024/06/15/nba-dallas-mavericks-owner-patrick-dumont-las-vegas-sands-casino-texas-legalized-gambling/,"“The NBA is a multifaceted business. It’s a media business, a hospitality business and a culinary business. It’s all about experience.""",2024-06-15T22:27:29Z,"As Game 3 of the NBA Finals tipped off at the American Airlines Center on Wednesday, Patrick Dumont, the new co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks, sat courtside amid a pantheon of Texas athletic elite. To his right: former NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, and three-time Super Bowl champion Emmitt Smith. Nearby, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who played high school and college football in Texas, was also cheering. Dumont, the president of gambling giant Las Vegas Sands Corp. — and son-in-law of billionaire Miriam Adelson — bought a majority stake in the Mavs with his family late last year from Mark Cuban. The deal valued the franchise at $3.5 billion. Since then, he’s been a regular at the games and is warmly acclimating to his new home away from home.  “I don’t think there are many cities in America where you can show up and everyone’s just warm and embracing,” Dumont said at the team’s practice facility ahead of Game 4 against the Boston Celtics, who have dominated the series and pushed Dallas to the brink of elimination. The Mavs ended up winning, 122-84, though no NBA team has ever come back from a 0-3 playoff deficit. “There’s a lot of pride about being a Texan, and it’s just a lot of fun to be part of.”  The purchase of the Mavs punctuated the family’s effort to deepen its ties in the state, including Sands’ desire to build casino resorts that will draw dollars and jobs to Texas. But in a state that has resisted efforts for gambling for years, Dumont said he and his family are ready to play the long game. “We really want to be in the state of Texas,” the 49-year-old said, referring to LVS and casino gambling. “We think this is a great investment opportunity and we’re here for the long term. We’re going to keep talking about the virtues of what this means for the state of Texas and how it can benefit the communities that these resorts will be located in.” In the meantime, the business of basketball is flourishing and Dallas is in the midst of a professional sports renaissance. The Texas Rangers won baseball’s World Series last year. The Dallas Stars made it to the NHL’s Western Conference Finals. And the Mavs exceeded the expectations of many basketball pundits. The city was on the short list to host the World Cup Final in 2026, and will host the most matches.  The NBA is close to signing new long-term broadcasting agreements that would pay the league about $76 billion over 11 years — three times its current deal. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said before the Finals that the league will turn to expansion, possibly overseas, after it completes the new TV rights negotiations. Las Vegas and Seattle are both looked at as favorites for new NBA franchises. Mexico City is also a contender. The WNBA has seen a surge of interest after Caitlin Clark joined the league. “The NBA is a multifaceted business,” Dumont said, sitting in the team’s “Real MVP Conference Room,” where research for the upcoming NBA draft had to be covered for secrecy. “It’s a media business, a hospitality business and a culinary business. It’s all about experience. Those are the types of things we do well and think we can bring to the city of Dallas.” All that makes owning a team in one of the fastest-growing regions in the US more compelling. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is building a new campus that will house about 5,000 employees in Dallas. BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities are among investors backing an upstart Texas stock exchange. The Dallas-Fort Worth area now has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York. “The state’s growing for a reason,” he said. “There’s good schools. There’s good communities. People are working hard. A lot of companies are trying to move here now because they realize that not every state is run this way.” Behind the scenes, the Adelson family is already laying the groundwork to face an immense political challenge to legalize gambling in Texas. The family recruited an army of lobbyists and ramped up its political spending. Since 2022, Adelson has poured $16.5 million into Texas campaigns and political action committees, Texas Ethics Commission records show.  That level of spending shouldn’t be at risk given Adelson’s deep pockets. With a net worth of $33.1 billion, the 78-year-old widow of Sands founder Sheldon Adelson is one of the 50 richest people on Earth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This year, the Texas Legislature voted down bills that would have legalized online and casino gambling. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who controls legislation in the state senate, has said he won’t bring a vote to the floor unless it has Republican support. There are some early signs that the political tides are shifting. About 75% of Texans support legislation to bring casino-style resorts to Texas, according to a January 2023 poll by the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston. And a Republican-backed bill proposing a constitutional amendment authorizing casino gambling at destination resorts made it out of a house committee last year – a first for Texas.  Governor Greg Abbott, who got $1 million in campaign contributions from Adelson in 2022, has also signaled openness on casinos. “The question is how to do it in a way that’s right for Texas,” Dumont said. “How do you deal with sports wagering? How do you deal with gaming? How do you ensure that you get the tourism benefit? That’s really what the discussion is about.” For now, Dumont and his family have the support of other Texas tycoons. Billionaire Tilman Fertitta, who owns the NBA’s Houston Rockets and the Golden Nugget casinos, has spent years advocating for Texas to join dozens of other states in allowing Las Vegas-style casino resorts, arguing they’d spur job growth and bring in more tourist dollars to restaurants, stores and hotels.  “Let’s do something to bring tourism and the business traveler and conventions to Texas — and these need to be billion-dollar properties that do that,” he said in an interview in February. “We need to do it right and build the casinos, and not have a bunch of slot machines at every single little grocery store.”  Cuban, who still owns a minority stake in the Mavs and provides advice on the team, has talked up the potential for real estate developments anchored by a casino and an arena.  “When you think of all the places you want to save up to vacation, Texas isn’t one of them,” Cuban told the Dallas Morning News around the time of the sale to the Adelson clan. “There’s no real destination that you save up for. That’s a problem and I think resort gaming would have a huge impact.” There’s still plenty of opposition. Rob Kohler, a lobbyist for the Christian Life Commission, the public policy arm of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, has been fighting against gambling in the state for more than two decades. “There has been much ado about how much the Adelsons have spent,” he said in an interview. “But they aren’t the first rich people that have tried to expand gambling. If this is about the amount of money that is spent, Texas would have an expansion of gambling long ago.” For now, Dumont says he’s focused on helping the team win.  “I have responsibility to ensure the success of the team,” he said. “I can’t give you a road map of exactly what that will mean, but my goal is to be present and to help the Mavericks be successful in the championships.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

88,"Steve Karnowski, The Associated Press","Massive $250 million theft from federal food aid program made possible by Minnesota agency’s lax oversight, audit finds",https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/minnesota-agency-lax-oversight-250-million-theft-federal-food-aid-program-audit/,"The trial gained widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash the night before the case went to the jury.",2024-06-14T09:14:52Z,"A Minnesota agency’s inadequate oversight of a federal program that was meant to provide food to kids, and its failure to act on red flags, created the opportunities that led to the theft of $250 million in one of the country’s largest pandemic aid fraud cases, the Legislature’s watchdog arm said Thursday in a scathing report. The Minnesota Department of Education “failed to act on warning signs known to the department prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the start of the alleged fraud, did not effectively exercise its authority to hold Feeding Our Future accountable to program requirements, and was ill-prepared to respond to the issues it encountered with Feeding Our Future,” the nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Auditor concluded. Seventy people have been charged in federal court for their alleged roles in a scheme prosecutors say centered on a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Five of the first seven defendants to stand trial were convicted Friday. The trial gained widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash the night before the case went to the jury. Authorities are still trying to determine the source of that money. Eighteen other defendants have already pleaded guilty. Trials are still pending for the others. Education Commissioner Willie L. Jett II disputed the auditor’s characterization of his agency’s oversight as inadequate. He said in a written response in the 120-page report that its oversight “met applicable standards” and that department officials “made effective referrals to law enforcement.” He said department staffers first spotted problems in summer 2020 and raised their concerns with federal authorities. “What happened with Feeding Our Future was a travesty — a coordinated, brazen abuse of nutrition programs that exist to ensure access to healthy meals for low-income children,” the commissioner wrote. “The responsibility for this flagrant fraud lies with the indicted and convicted fraudsters.” But Republican legislative leaders said at a news conference that the report shows that the failure to stop the fraud lies with the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, which has said that the state’s hands were tied by a 2021 court order to resume payments despite its concerns — a charge the judge disputed — and that the FBI asked the state to continue making payments while the investigation continued. “This is stunning,” said GOP Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks. “The Department of Education and Gov. Walz have repeatedly tried to tell the public that they did all they could … but this report clearly demonstrates that was a false narrative.” Sharp criticism also came from some Democrats during a hearing on the report. Sen. Ann Rest, of New Hope, said it was unfortunate that Jett’s predecessors, who ran the agency during the time in question, were not there to answer questions. “Those commissioners had the authority, as was pointed out in this report by the legislative auditor, and they clearly did not exercise it to discover and to report fraud,” Rest said. “We do not hear of … similar programs using federal money to feed students in other states that experienced such fraud.” Rest lamented that nobody in the department has taken responsibility for what happened. In a variant on the expression, “The buck stops here,” Rest said: “But what we really do have is the buck is still running down the street — running down the street and stopping nowhere. And that is unacceptable.” Republican Rep. Patti Anderson, of Dellwood, who served as state auditor from 2003-07, said the disruption of the pandemic was no excuse. “They could have stopped this long before there were 250 plus million dollars in fraudulent claims sent out to these folks,” Anderson said. “All this could have all been avoided.” Jett, who was appointed commissioner in January 2023 amid the fallout, said his agency has implemented changes to strengthen its oversight capabilities, including establishing an office of inspector general in 2023, adding a general counsel’s office in 2022, providing training to all staff on its updated fraud-reporting policies, and contracting with a firm to conduct financial reviews of certain partners. Federal prosecutors say the conspiracy exploited rules that were kept lax so the economy wouldn’t crash during the pandemic. The FBI began digging into it in spring 2021. The defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in passport fraud and accepted kickbacks. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, and only about $50 million of it has been recovered, authorities say. The money came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state agency, which funneled the funds through partners including Feeding Our Future. The defendants awaiting trial include Aimee Bock, the founder of the group. She has maintained her innocence. An Associated Press analysis published last June documented how thieves across the country plundered billions in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. Fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion, while an additional $123 billion was wasted or misspent. The combined loss represented 10% of the $4.3 trillion the government disbursed by last fall. Nearly 3,200 people have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen aid has been seized, according to the Justice Department. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

89,"Ken Sweet, The Associated Press",FDIC chair who quit following report of workplace stalking and harassment will be replaced by Georgetown law professor,https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/fdic-chair-quit-report-stalking-harassment-homophobia-replaced-christy-goldsmith-romero/,"Goldsmith Romero is also a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the nation’s financial derivatives regulator.",2024-06-14T09:04:05Z,"President Joe Biden will nominate Christy Goldsmith Romero to replace Martin Gruenberg as head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The announcement from the White House on Thursday came after Gruenberg’s tenure became marred by allegations of workplace abuse that led to him to resign. A longtime financial regulator, Goldsmith Romero is currently a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the nation’s financial derivatives regulator. She previously worked with the Department of Treasury and was part of the team that handled the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which lent $700 billion to troubled banks during the 2008 financial crisis. She also is a law professor at Georgetown University. Her previous nominations to the nation’s financial regulators were unanimously confirmed by the Senate. “She has proven herself to be a strong, independent, and fair regulator who is not afraid to do what’s right,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and chair of the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement. Gruenberg last month said he would resign from the FDIC, after an independent report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton found incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees. Complaints included a woman who said she was stalked by a coworker and continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field office supervisor referring to gay men as “little girls;” and a female field examiner who described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior examiner’s private parts. Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg to step down since the allegations emerged late last year. The White House and Gruenberg resisted those calls partly because the FDIC is led by a five member board, and his resignation would pass control of the agency to the FDIC’s vice chair, who is a Republican. Gruenberg’s resignation would not be official until Goldsmith Romero nomination is finalized. “FDIC employees deserve a safe workplace that allows them to focus on their important mission to safeguard our country’s financial security. Unfortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Gruenberg, that hasn’t been the case,” said Sen. Tim Scott, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, in a statement. The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in case their bank fails. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

90,Bloomberg,Russia is holding off on dollar and euro trading altogether after a new round of sanctions kicks in,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/06/14/russia-is-holding-off-on-dollar-and-euro-trading-altogether-after-a-new-round-of-sanctions-kick-in-chinese-yuan/,"“What will not change is the continued strengthening of the yuan’s position in Russia.""",2024-06-14T09:06:40Z,"Russia’s main exchange said it’s halting trading in US dollars and the euro after President Joe Biden’s administration unveiled a raft of measures designed to further isolate Moscow from the international financial system over its war in Ukraine. The Moscow Exchange from Thursday halted trading on the foreign exchange, precious metals, stock, money and the standardized over-the-counter derivatives markets in instruments with settlement in dollars and the European single currency. The company, known as Moex, was targeted along with the country’s main settlement depository, by US restrictions announced late Wednesday. The MOEX Russia Index opened down as much as 4% in Moscow on Thursday.  The move has sown confusion among markets over the fallout from the sanctions. The changes are likely to lead to increased costs for market participants due to higher commissions and wider bid-ask spreads as well as unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations.  Any settlement with a foreign counterpart and foreign trade operations may be negatively affected, and the restrictions could also have an impact on yuan trading, which now accounts for more than half of foreign currency exchange.  Russia’s authorities have sought to move away from the dollar and euro, branding them “toxic” amid sanctions over President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The share of the yuan in trading has increased, while officials have pursued measures to discourage businesses and people from using the currencies of nations that have imposed restrictions.  “Transactions in dollar and euros for individuals have already been significantly limited for quite some time,” said Sofya Donets, an economist at Tinkoff Investments. “For the average Russian, nothing much will change.” “What will not change is the continued strengthening of the yuan’s position in Russia,” Donets said. Despite some concerns that settlements involving China’s currency may be affected, the sanctions weren’t designed to limit its use, she said. Transactions with the dollar and euro will still be available on the over-the-counter market, the Bank of Russia said in a statement. The regulator said it will use bank and OTC data to set the ruble’s exchange rates to those currencies.  The central bank also delayed the start of trading Thursday on the foreign exchange and precious metals markets to 9:50 a.m. Moscow time from 6:50 a.m. “Escalation of sanctions will destabilize the currency market and shift flows towards private non-sanctioned banks. The next step of escalation can be secondary sanctions on foreign banks that help with settlements.” Alexander Isakov, Russia economist.  Daily trading in the dollar started in Russia more than three decades ago. The share of currencies Russia has labeled as toxic, which include the greenback and euro, fell to 45.9% in exchange-based foreign currency trading in May, while the yuan’s share rose to a record of 53.6%, according to the Bank of Russia’s data.  “Companies and individuals can continue to buy and sell the US dollar and euro through Russian banks,” the central bank said, adding that all funds in those currencies in accounts and deposits “will remain safe.”  Russia’s shift away from western currencies since sanctions were first imposed over the 2014 annexation of Crimea may limit the disruption from the US penalties.  “Overall, there is a sense that the main costs are related to lack of information about exchange rates and flows, but not to the shortage of currency,” said Evgeny Koshelev, an analyst at Rosbank. “The cost of alternative conversion channels for exporters are relatively fixed, albeit not small. For importers, they could increase at first, then a return to the previous level is possible.” The Bank of Russia has been preparing for the possibility that the country’s only foreign-exchange clearing house falls under sanctions since last year. To avoid a collapse in settlements, the regulator had developed additional mechanisms for determining official exchange rates in the absence of data from the Moscow Exchange. “The biggest effect is the effect on the Moscow Exchange itself,” Donets said. “Even then, it’s not critical.”  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

91,The Associated Press,Bernie Sanders and 31 Democratic senators demand airline workers be allowed to go on strike ‘as necessary’,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/bernie-sanders-31-democratic-senators-airline-workers-strike-as-necessary/,"Flight attendants at American, United and other airlines have tried strike-authorization votes and picketing at airports to put pressure on the carriers.",2024-06-13T09:00:35Z,"A group of 32 senators say federal mediators should speed up labor negotiations between airlines and their flight attendants and other workers, even granting them permission to go on strike “as necessary.” The lawmakers said Wednesday that airlines feel no pressure to reach contract agreements quickly because federal law makes it difficult for airline workers to strike. That causes talks to drag on for years, they said. The senators — 31 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont — joined House Democrats by weighing in while flight attendants at American Airlines and United Airlines are trying to gain more leverage at the bargaining table. Before they can legally strike, airline workers need permission from the National Mediation Board, which must determine that more negotiations are hopeless. The board has already turned down a request by American’s flight attendants. The lawmakers complained in a letter to the board that without new contracts, airline employees can go years without a raise, “while airline carriers make record-breaking profits.” They asked the board to use all its powers, including granting permission to strike “as necessary,” to settle long-running negotiations. The senators said the ability to strike is a fundamental right that has helped workers in other industries win “groundbreaking new contracts in recent years.” Flight attendants at American, United and other airlines have tried strike-authorization votes and picketing at airports to put pressure on the carriers. The workers are frustrated that they haven’t been able to win the large wage increases that pilots at Delta, United, American and Southwest have received under contracts approved since the start of last year. The mediation board has not permitted an airline strike since 2010, when Spirit Airlines pilots conducted a brief walkout. Even with mediators’ permission, strikes can be delayed or blocked by the president and Congress. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

92,Beth Greenfield,Here’s how Meta’s virtual-reality workout compares to real-life exercise,https://fortune.com/well/article/meta-virtual-reality-workouts-just-as-good-as-real-life-fitness/,"A new study finds the workouts just as effective as real-life “high-quality cardiovascular activity” like running, boxing, and swimming",2024-06-13T09:00:00Z,"I am standing on a grassy mountaintop, listening to birds chirping, getting lost in the stunning landscape. Suddenly, pop music swells and round black and white objects the size of soccer balls begin to fly toward me at an accelerated clip, exploding into confetti each time I punch one away.  No, I’m not dreaming—just working out in my living room while wearing a VR headset, playing the Supernatural fitness game, immersed in a 360-degree wonderland. When it’s over, I’m panting, elated, and totally sweaty, just like when I finish taking a class at the gym—and the next day my lats are on fire.  So I’m not surprised to read the findings of a small new study which found that VR exercise—specifically the Supernatural app on a Meta Quest headset—was just as effective as comparable real-life, “high-quality cardiovascular activity” like running, boxing, and swimming.  The study, out of the Behavioral Medicine Lab at the University of Victoria, Canada, and published on June 6 in the journal JMIR Serious Games, looked at the effect of two medium-intensity modes of the games “Flow” and “Boxing” on 24 participants with little or no VR experience. It measured results with what’s called a Metabolic Equivalent of Task, or MET, score, which is a multiple of a person’s base resting rate, used to calculate an estimated calorie burn based on the individual’s weight.  Further, it looked at mood changes post-exercise and found they were consistent for what you’d expect after vigorous exercise, with participants reporting they felt “full of pep” and “lively” after the workouts.  “I think there’s a lot of skepticism because [VR fitness] is very new,” Leanne Pedante, Supernatural head of fitness and one of six coaches who guide Supernatural users through its more than 3,000 workouts (at a subscription price of $10 a month or $100 a year), tells Fortune. There is often a  misunderstanding that “you’re not really moving” with VR workouts, and that it’s like a video game, with a perception that “it’s kind of passive, and not an activity where you would actually move enough to sweat.” The study, Pedante adds, “helps us ground it with cycling, jogging, boxing—things that people are familiar with.” The study was commissioned and paid for by Meta but carried out independently, led by the University’s School of Exercise Science professor Ryan Rhodes, whose focus of research has been “the psychology of enjoyment and being engaged in what you’re doing,” noted a press release on the study. “A lot of exercise is an act of willpower for people,” he says. “Let’s face it, running on a treadmill is not exactly a fun, engaging activity. We do it because it’s good for us but, ultimately, it can be difficult to stick with it.” That’s where VR technology can step in.  “When you’re doing something like this VR app, it really feels like you’re standing in the middle of Antarctica or you could be on a beautiful beach,” he says. “That can add to the experience.” The study’s results track with other similar findings, including a 2020 systematic review which suggested that “VR exercise has the potential to exert a positive impact on an individual’s physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes compared with traditional exercise,” as well as a Supernatural assessment by the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise. That organization, formed in 2017 by kinesiologists to study the effects of VR fitness on the body, assigns ratings to VR workouts—others include FitXR and Litesport—based on METs, as with the new study. In rating the Supernatural Boxing game, it found that its combination of straight jabs, hooks, uppercuts, and blocks made for good, vigorous exercise, with an exertion level most equivalent to real-life cycling. “Looking at the [new Meta] study, I think that their results seem very reasonable,” Aaron Stanton, director of the Institute. “They registered an average MET score of 7.89 METs, and our testing actually rated it higher than that, at 11.44 METs. Their testing was lower than ours, and so I don’t think they’re likely exaggerating.” (Note from this writer: They weren’t.) Another reason some people may be skeptical of VR workouts, Pedante says, is that, especially post-COVID, they “focus on the isolation part. I hear a lot of that, the idea that you’re kind of leaving the real world.” But, she adds, “The goal has never been that we want people to stop doing things in the real world. The goal is to make sure people find places within VR that can serve their needs in a way that isn’t getting served.”  It’s something she sees frequently with Supernatural fans, including, “People who haven’t been able to make home workouts stick who are now three years in with this because it’s fun.” The “gamification,” she notes, is helpful, providing the same sort of competitive vibe you’d get in a group fitness class. “It helps to give you some sort of metric to align yourself with, to chase after.” Further, while the workouts are indeed solo activities, that hasn’t stopped superfans from creating communities—including a Facebook community page with 108,000 members and real-life meetups happening around the country, including one group making a pilgrimage to hike the actual Tom Dick and Harry Mountain in Oregon that serves as the virtual backdrop for one of the Supernatural workouts.  “I often go to the Facebook page for inspiration, and to see what workouts are coming out, what people are achieving,” Jessa Curcillo, 45, tells Fortune. “The collective excitement keeps my motivation going.” The Columbus, Ohio mom of four kids between 10 and 16 says that Supernatural helped bring fitness back into her life full-throttle, as it has previously been something she “endured for the results.”  Doing these workouts for about 30 minutes a day, she says, “really changed my mindset about fitness. I really felt like I was cheating the system, like it was a vacation just for me.” As a contract worker, her schedule is flexible, and while she does other real-life exercising here and there, Supernatural is her main workout.  “I’m kind of in a phase of my life that is pure chaos, so if not for this, I couldn’t fit fitness into my life,” she says. Pedante points to people like Curcillo as the reason why Supernatural’s stickiness is so important—especially considering that no more than 28% of Americans met the combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, per the CDC.  “We see it all the time—people who hadn’t been able to make home workouts stick who are now three years in because it’s so fun,” she says. “There is a massive benefit all of us [coaches] have seen, and we want more people to know the solution is there for them.” More on fitness and exercise: © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

93,The Associated Press,Puerto Rico hit by another massive power outage,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/puerto-rico-massive-power-outage-340000-luma-private-electric-company/,"The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayamón, Caguas and Carolina.",2024-06-13T08:45:15Z,"A widespread power outage hit Puerto Rico Wednesday night, leaving more than 340,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory’s power plants shut down. The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayamón, Caguas and Carolina. Luma Energy, which operates transmission and distribution for Puerto Rico’s power authority, said on X that the outage was tied to an issue with the power plants’ transmission lines. It provided a statement to The Associated Press saying it was investigating the outage that coincided with the shutdown of units operated by Genera PR, which operates and maintains state power generation units. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi condemned the outage and said he was demanding answers and solutions from Luma and Genera PR. “The events that have been occurring in recent weeks with our electrical system are unacceptable,” he posted on X. “While it is true that we have old plants and transmission lines in terrible condition, the people continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of sense of urgency that private operators are demonstrating.” Both Luma and Genera PR were selected as private operators under Pierluisi’s administration. The outage is the most recent in a string of blackouts to hit Puerto Rico, which is still trying to rebuild the grid after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm. The outage prompted the mayor of the San Juan capital, Miguel Romero, to declare a state of emergency late Wednesday as he accused Luma of sharing limited information about the ongoing blackouts. “There are thousands of children with specific feeding needs, as well as older adults who often need therapy machines to protect their health and often save their lives,” the decree stated. Scores of Puerto Ricans took to social media to condemn the most recent outage and demand the ouster of Luma, noting that it occurred amid excessive heat warnings. Not all on the island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40% can afford generators or solar panels. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

94,"Lea Skene, Brian Witte, The Associated Press",Baltimore’s busy port is expected to return to normal in July,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/baltimores-busy-port-normal-july-francis-scott-key-bridge-collapse/,"The deadly disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River.",2024-06-13T08:36:13Z,"Commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore is expected to return to normal levels next month, officials said Wednesday, after the channel fully reopened this week for the first time since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. “I’ve been waiting to say this for every day for the last 11 weeks: Maryland, the Fort McHenry Channel is fully cleared, and the Port of Baltimore is reopened for business,” Gov. Wes Moore said at a waterside news conference to highlight the milestone. As the governor spoke, a passing ship blasted its horn. “You hear that?” Moore said. “That’s a beautiful sound.” Behind him, giant cranes lifted shipping containers from the deck of a docked cargo ship and deposited them on land. Many shipping companies rerouted their cargo to other ports following the deadly collapse in March. The deadly disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River. The estimated cost for the entire salvage operation is $160 million, with federal, state and local agencies involved. Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The port, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, is expected to be operating at normal capacity by mid-July. All that rerouted commercial traffic “belongs in Baltimore today,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news briefing earlier this week. “We have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.” Crews were able to reopen portions of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said. But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region. State officials helped establish several relief programs to keep people employed and businesses afloat in the immediate aftermath. “We were a wounded port,” said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoreman’s Association Local 333, which represents Baltimore port workers. In a competitive industry, he said, other ports were looking to take Baltimore’s cargo. Reopening the channel means keeping thousands of longshoremen in their jobs, Cowan said. Officials estimated that the salvage operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date to open the main channel. Maryland used about $60 million in federal emergency funds to open three other smaller channels outside the main one. Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it’s completed by 2028. President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress. In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort. “Baltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,” he said. The cargo ship Dali lost power and crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew plunging to their deaths. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the vessel experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow, before being refloated and guided back to port May 20. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide. Officials said two-way traffic can now resume, and additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

95,"The Associated Press, Tom Krisher",Electric vehicles’ uphill battle gets steeper as rampant charger theft sours U.S. demand,https://fortune.com/2024/06/13/electric-vehicles-charger-theft-us-demand-tesla-ev-copper-wiring-cable/,"EV cables contain copper wiring, which has a hefty price tag in the global market, making them a significant target for theft.",2024-06-13T14:54:59Z,"DETROIT (AP) — Just before 2 a.m. on a chilly April night in Seattle, a Chevrolet Silverado pickup stopped at an electric vehicle charging station on the edge of a shopping center parking lot. Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2½ minutes, they were gone. The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material. The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful. Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don’t know of any charging stations nearby. If even finding a charging station doesn’t necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now. America’s major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs. Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 — about 45% of its global sales — though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035. Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn’t likely to strengthen the automakers’ case. Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation’s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 — four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America’s vice president of operations. “We’re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,” Lambkin said. “So to have an entire station that’s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.” Two other leading EV charging companies — Flo and EVgo — also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too. Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation’s largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said. “Vandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,” EVgo said. The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution. The problem isn’t confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station. Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit. In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away. In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging. “They’re not just taking one,” Carson said. “When they’re hit, they’re hit pretty hard.” Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables. “If my battery was really low, I’d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,” he said. “If it was so low that I couldn’t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.” The charging companies say it’s become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases. Charging companies say there isn’t actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard. “They’re not making a significant amount of money,” he said. “They’re not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.” Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch $400. The problem for the charging companies is that it’s much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works. The charging companies are trying to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal. But it’s often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal. The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods. Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed. In the meantime, Electrify America said Seattle police are trying to track down the thieves in the video. And Carson said the Houston police are pursuing leads in the Tesla theft. “We’d like to get them stopped,” he said, “and then let the court system do what they’re supposed to do.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

96,Beth Greenfield,Workplace incivility is one the rise: 'It's about basic respect',https://fortune.com/well/article/workplace-incivility-gaslighting-gossip-disrespect/,"""It affected my self-esteem, big-time,"" says a woman who left her job over her poor treatment.",2024-06-14T19:00:00Z,"Angela had been in the media industry for over a decade when she began to notice dismissive behaviors from others at a new job. There was rudeness in meetings, gatekeeping of important information, ignoring her contributions in Slack room discussions, and gaslighting about it all, including from a series of managers. It eventually all took a toll.  “It affected my self-esteem, big-time,” Angela, who is being identified by her middle name for privacy,  tells Fortune. “‘Rude’ isn’t a performance metric. Basic human communication is not a part of what was discussed or expected, but that’s what we’re talking about. To me it’s about basic respect.” She frequently thought about leaving, but her job was a good one, and she was hesitant. Still, she says, “I was boxed out … At what point do you throw in the towel?” The behavior eventually got so bad that it sent her to therapy—and, finally, out the door. Now, still shaken and questioning her skills as a result of the experience, she’s seriously considering a career change, noting, “It was really bad for my psyche.” And she’s far from alone. On Glassdoor discussion boards, there’s an endless scroll of people talking about being treated poorly at work—distrusting themselves because a boss questions every move, or facing aggression and gaslighting from coworkers to the point of experiencing “crippling dread and anxiety” and even “PTSD.” It’s all part of what human resource experts see as a rise in what’s called workplace incivility—behavior that is inconsiderate or rude that “violates social norms for workplace behavior and that leads to negative effects for the employee as well as the organization,” according to John O’Brien, a psychologist and executive coach with a forthcoming book on the topic.  It’s unlike bullying, which is more easily identifiable and “much more often intentional, usually with a specific target, and meant to intimidate someone so that the bully can have some certain outcome,” O’Brien explains. And it could be an element of “toxicity,” which is more of a catchall about high-stress environments. But incivility, he says, is more often, though not always, unintentional. It’s a collection of “stress-related behaviors that emerge spontaneously and may be seemingly inconsequential, such as eye-rolling,” and which feeling upset over might be brushed off by others as “overreacting.”  A March 2024 survey of over 1,600 U.S. employees by the membership-based Society for Human Resource Management found that 66% had experienced or witnessed incivility at work within the past month, while 57% had experienced or witnessed such behavior within the past week—with the most common forms of incivility being addressing others disrespectfully (36%), interrupting others who are speaking (34%), and excessive micromanaging (32%).  It also found only 25% believe their managers are effective at handling incivility when it rears its ugly head. Further, a 2022 survey of 2,000 global workers by Georgetown University professor of management Christine Porath found that 76% and 78% of respondents, respectively, experience or witness incivility at least once a month, while 78% believe that bad behavior from customers toward employees is more common than it was five years ago.  “There is such an increase,” Joyce Russell, an executive coach and Dean Emeritus and Professor of Management at the Villanova School of Business, tells Fortune. “I hear this from a lot of people.” When she offered a monthly chat to leaders on the topic recently, she says, “they jumped on the call and just had example after example.”  Among them: People ignoring others, sending “not nice” emails to an employee and copying everybody, spreading rumors, gossiping, eye rolling in meetings, taking credit for the work of others, and being quick to assign blame and never taking responsibility for problems. “They’re behaviors that have always existed,” Russell says, “but people feel like they’re more acceptable now.”  O’Brien, who has also noticed the rise and believes it mirrors the increasing lack of incivility in society at large, attributes it to a number of factors, including that most ubiquitous of culprits: social media.  “The more impersonal ways of communicating I think is part of it,” he says, though there’s more to it, as well.  “Stress levels in society have risen and, even prior to the pandemic, levels of depression and anxiety were rising, and I think that has contributed to it,” he says. “Plus the political landscape and cycle that we are in right now—of people getting rewarded for negative behaviors at the national level.”  Then there are America’s deep political divisions, the fact that many of us have not yet readjusted to coming together in person, and leftover stress from the pandemic. “People don’t know where to put that,” he says, “and if there’s not a lot of emotional intelligence, it comes leaking out in certain ways.”  While “blatant bullying” is easier to be aware of, point out, and report, says Russell, “smaller signs of disrespect that people are giving each other” are a little harder to pinpoint. She stresses, though, that such behaviors almost always come from the top down—whether leaders are behaving unethically themselves or simply failing to take action against others who do, thereby condoning it. “We see this at the highest levels, even from the previous Administration,” she says. “People always look to the leaders, even in firms… If they’re not taking action, then other people think, well, it’s OK. You see a difference in companies where leaders take action or demonstrate better behaviors.”  When subject to uncivil behaviors, whether by coworkers, leaders, or customers/patients, O’Brien says, “People’s stress levels rise, so they find themselves more tense, irritable, and maybe more reactive.”  It can also exacerbate mental health issues, he adds, explaining that for people already at risk of depression and anxiety, dealing with workplace incivility “can sometimes be one of the major stressors that triggers a level that may need medical attention.” Plus, quality of work will typically suffer, from standpoints of both productivity and engagement. “Many wind up losing time at work ruminating about the incident,” says O’Brien, who adds that often, those who get treated poorly in turn treat others that way—so the fallout is both “individual and systemic.”  Also huge, says Russell, is how workplace incivility impacts morale—and how it continues the buildup of stress very likely still lingering from pandemic times. “COVID was such an impactful experience, and I don’t know that we allowed people the time to recuperate from that … People feel overworked and tired, and they just got right back into the race.” Feeling abused on top of it all, she says, “can mean people not wanting to be as loyal or committed” to a workplace.  So what’s a fed-up employee to do?  O’Brien suggests people start by trying immediate, direct options, such as having a conversation with the person who has been uncivil. It could also be helpful to consider that the offender may have been so unintentionally.  “One classic example is someone who is interrupting others in meetings,” he says. ”You may assume they don’t respect your opinion, but in fact there may be something else completely going on. They may have trouble with impulse control.” Sometimes, he suggests, talking through what happened with a boss or a mentor or a peer can help in figuring out how to approach the situation. “Even talking to friends outside of the organization,” O’Brien suggests. “And if it starts to rise to a level of more significant distress, getting into therapy or seeking out a coach.” Through those discussions, he says, it will be helpful to think about whether or not incivility is the norm at your company. “If that’s the norm, then maybe they have to find a different work environment,” he says. “But that’s the exception as opposed to the rule.” For leaders, Russell says that bringing in a mediator to help with difficult situations could be “a really good solution, because you’re getting people to try to work together.”  And in general, she adds, “I don’t think people have good skills with conflict management.” It’s why an outsider could be helpful. But doing more in organizations to properly train leaders to manage and understand conflict can go a long way in battling incivility, she stresses—as can establishing codes of conduct, which she calls “critical.”   “It all sounds like common sense, but people have gotten away from behaving the way they need to,” Russell says. “And it starts with the leader who can set the right tone and establish guidelines.” More on workplace well-being: © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

97,Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez,Elon Musk’s prediction that Chinese carmakers would ‘demolish’ global rivals is coming true as they overtake U.S. competitors,https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/elon-musks-prediction-chinese-carmakers-would-demolish-global-rivals/,The European Commission and the U.S. recently levied new tariffs on Chinese EVs.,2024-06-14T19:32:58Z,"After overtaking their U.S. competitors in sales for the first time, Chinese carmakers are one step closer to fulfilling Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s prophecy that one day they would “demolish” most other car companies. Chinese carmakers sold 13.43 million cars last year, outpacing the 11.93 million cars sold by American companies, according to a report by automotive data company JATO Dynamics. Warren Buffett-backed EV maker BYD produced the most popular Chinese car, a compact sedan called the Qin, and had two other vehicles in the top 25 most sold cars last year. Tesla, for its part, claimed the title of the best selling car in 2023 with the Model Y. In a Tesla earnings call in January, Musk praised Chinese automakers, calling them the “most competitive” carmakers in the world. He also warned against Chinese automakers’ rapid growth. “If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,” Musk said at the time. That prediction may slowly be coming true as ​​Chinese car brands look abroad to spur growth after seeing demand fall in China. Last year, Chinese automakers trailed only Japanese and European automakers in terms of global light vehicle sales, according to the report. Felipe Muñoz, a senior analyst at JATO Dynamics, said the conformity of legacy carmakers is partly to blame for the rise of strong Chinese competitors. “Negligence from legacy automakers, which has resulted in consistently high car prices, has inadvertently driven consumers towards more affordable Chinese alternatives,” Munoz said in a statement. “As car prices continue to rise elsewhere, Chinese car brands are capitalizing on this trend to gain market traction at a much faster pace.” Confronted with the might of China’s growing auto sector, some legacy carmakers are taking action to compete. In Japan, two of its biggest automakers, Nissan and Honda, announced a partnership in March to compete with China on electric vehicles.  Some politicians have accused Chinese carmakers of unethical behavior while attempting  to stymie their threat through tariffs. This week, the European Commission slapped three Chinese automakers, including BYD, with import tariffs ranging from 17.4% to 38.1% following a probe by the commission that found battery electric vehicles from China benefited from state subsidies unfair to global competition.  In May, President Joe Biden also increased the tariff on imported Chinese electric vehicles to 102.5% up from the previous rate of 27.5%.  “China’s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I’m not going to let that happen on my watch,” Biden said in a previous statement this year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

98,Seamus Webster,Jensen Huang made Nvidia a $3 billion juggernaut. But the path to success was filled with ‘despair’ and ‘torture’,https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/jensen-huang-made-nvidia-a-3-trillion-juggernaut-despair-torture/,"At a Fortune conference in 2018, the tech CEO said “there’s no point in starting a company unless you want to make a meaningful contribution to society.”",2024-06-14T21:43:04Z,"Nvidia has been holding a clinic in shattering expectations. The company’s market cap has increased 160% in the past six months, up to $3.10 trillion, as the rush to cash in on A.I. has launched the chip maker into position as the third most valuable company in the world, trailing only Apple ($3.30 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.25 trillion).  For Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, it’s been an equally meteoric come up. Huang’s wealth surged more than $62 billion this year, up to $106.1 billion, and he leapfrogged fellow tech star Michael Dell to become the 13th-richest person on the planet.  But the man at the helm of Nvidia’s historic rise hasn’t sugarcoated how difficult the road to success was, either for himself, or the company he founded more than 30 years ago.  When Nvidia started in 1993, Huang, along with co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began with an idea of creating chips that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers—or graphic processing units, specifically for video games.  But speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in 2018, Huang told audience members that he always believed GPUs could have broader applications in society, otherwise there would have been “no point in starting a company.” “It’s incredibly hard to start a company; it’s incredibly hard to start a business,” Huang said at the conference. “The depth of despair, the suffering, the torture—balanced by the great joy of doing something the world has never done before—is beyond words can describe. So unless you believe you’re going to make a real contribution to society it’s going to be incredibly hard to start that journey.” The reason Nvidia got its start in gaming, Haung said, was that video games were the only area in technology where the computational potential was incredibly advanced, but there was also an enormous demand among consumers.  Once they realized the potential scale of GPU servers, Huang said they were able to move into workstations, supercomputers, self-driving cars, and ultimately A.I. But all of that was only possible because of PC gaming. “3D graphics and video games are the engine of innovation in our company, the engine of [research and development] scale,” he said at the conference.  Huang has made other, more recent comments that paint a picture of entrepreneurship that is far from idyllic.  During an interview on a podcast in the fall of 2023, Huang was asked what kind of company he would think about starting if he could turn back the clock 30 years, and the engineer-turned-executive had a somewhat surprising response.  “I wouldn’t do it,” he said.  “If we realized the pain and suffering [involved] and just how vulnerable you’re going to feel, the challenges that you’re going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong—I don’t think anybody would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it.”  Correction, June 14, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated Nvidia’s market capitalization in the headline. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

99,"Josh Funk, The Associated Press",EPA urged to conduct soil studies near the site of a toxic Ohio train derailment,https://fortune.com/2024/06/14/epa-test-soil-toxic-ohio-train-derailment-site/,Nonprofit Government Accountability Project argues that the EPA should have already followed up on the tests of gardens and crops in the city where the Norfolk Southern derailment took place.,2024-06-14T09:16:28Z,"The Environmental Protection Agency should conduct additional soil studies near the site of a toxic train derailment in Ohio and warn people it might not be safe to garden there after independent testing showed high levels of chemicals in locally grown garlic, a watchdog group said Thursday. In a petition filed with the federal agency, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project argues that the EPA should have already followed up on the tests of gardens and crops in the city where the Norfolk Southern derailment took place. “It is unconscionable that the EPA has not conducted its own testing on garden crops in East Palestine, nor have they sampled for dioxins in the home produce,” the nonprofit group’s senior environmental officer, Lesley Pacey, told The Associated Press in advance of the petition filing. “Yet, the EPA has told residents to garden and eat home produce as usual.” The Associated Press sent emails to EPA officials seeking comment about the petition Thursday. The agency has been telling people it’s safe to garden since nearly three months after the February 2023 derailment, based on tests conducted by state agriculture officials at 31 locations around town and on surrounding farms. The officials tested winter wheat, malting barley, pasture grasses and rye from area farms. “Residential soil sampling results are within typical ranges for the area, and garden plants are generally considered safe to eat,” the EPA said to the community. In the past, agency officials have dismissed the independent tests cited by the Government Accountability Project, pointing to their concerns with quality control. The tests were performed by Scott Smith, a businessman and inventor who, since his own factory was inundated by tainted floodwaters in 2006, has been on a crusade to help communities affected by chemical disasters. EPA officials say they can’t tell if his data is valid without reviewing all of the reports detailing his methodology and results. Smith offered last summer to share his files with the agency but only if it would share its information with him. They never reached an agreement. The EPA has said that previous testing conducted by contractors hired by the railroad did not show high levels of dioxins or other chemicals outside the train derailment site after the initial evacuation order was lifted, and therefore, additional tests in individual yards and gardens weren’t needed. The only place the EPA reported finding high levels of cancer-causing dioxins was in the area immediately around the derailment about two weeks after the crash. That soil was included in the nearly 179,000 tons (71,668 metric tons) of material dug up and disposed of last year. But some residents aren’t taking any chances. Marilyn Figley didn’t dare plant a garden last year after the derailment even though she and her husband do everything they can to be self-sufficient, including gardening and raising chickens for meat and eggs. She did harvest some garlic after the derailment that she had planted previously, however. Some of it had levels of dioxins more than 500 times higher than a sample of garlic grown and harvested from someone else’s yard the year before the derailment, according to Smith’s tests. Figley said they decided to plant a garden again this year after using one of her husband’s tractors to remove the top 3 inches (8 centimeters) of soil and replace that with fresh dirt. “I’d rather eat dioxins than die of starvation I guess,” Figley said. “I’m pretty worried, but what can you do?” Dioxins have been a key concern for East Palestine residents ever since officials decided to blow open five tank cars of the derailed train and burn the vinyl chloride contained within them. The chemical is used to make a variety of plastic products, including pipes, wire and packaging materials, and is found in polyvinyl chloride plastic, better known as PVC. Thousands of residents had to evacuate their homes temporarily after the derailment and during the venting and burning of the vinyl chloride, which sent an enormous toxic plume of black smoke over the town. Last summer, the local farmers market made a point of bringing in produce from several states away because of all the worries about anything grown in the area. “I certainly didn’t eat anybody’s tomatoes or cucumbers,” said Tamara Lynn Freeze, whose freshly grown garlic was also tested by Smith and showed dioxin levels five times higher than what was found in garlic she still had sitting in her garage from a year before the derailment. Freeze says she developed a chronic sinus infection and joint pain after the derailment — symptoms that seem to ease any time she’s away from the area for more than a few hours. Smith has visited East Palestine more than two dozen times since the derailment to test soil and water for dioxins and other chemicals. He is not a scientist by training but has traveled to chemical disaster sites for years. His testing is reviewed by a team of scientific advisers, including a former top Ohio EPA expert, and he sends all his samples to a laboratory that the EPA and others agree is reputable. Smith is also an inventor and holds 25 patents, including for a specialized foam that repels water and absorbs oil, which he developed at his former company, Cellect Technologies. He has offered to sell the product in some of the affected communities he has visited, but he says he isn’t making a profit on his work in East Palestine. Smith got his start with disasters when floodwater contaminated with chemicals swept into a Cellect factory, destroying equipment and forcing the business to shut down for months. Since then, he has conducted investigations of dozens of environmental and health emergencies, including the BP Gulf oil spill and the Flint, Michigan, lead water crisis. In Flint, some of Smith’s results were used by a nonprofit group affiliated with actor Mark Ruffalo that questioned whether it was safe to bathe in the city’s water. Smith’s actions put him in conflict with scientists who were conducting their own tests and with EPA Response Coordinator Mark Durno, the same agency representative overseeing the cleanup in East Palestine. Despite their disagreements, Durno did remark that Smith “certainly understands how to use appropriate laboratories both for the chemical work that he’s doing and the biological work that he is doing.” “From that perspective, he seems qualified to collect samples and collect and share data,” Durno said in a video interview he gave for an unfinished documentary about Smith’s work. But in East Palestine, Durno has consistently questioned the quality of Smith’s testing. Since last summer, he has refused to meet with him or test alongside him because he believes the EPA’s testing plan already gives an objective, valid sense of the level of contamination existing in the community. He added that testing in individual locations in town, as Smith is doing, won’t produce useful data if it isn’t part of a larger sampling plan. Smith said he has applied the lessons of Flint by making sure that his scientific advisers review all his data before he releases it himself directly to the public. He argues that even if his test results aren’t perfect, they should prompt additional investigation by the EPA. “I’m basically calling for more testing,” Smith said. “I’m not trying to incite more panic. My point is it’d be very easy for the EPA to just test the garlic and report it. We can find no evidence they ever tested garden crops from residents.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.
