 Learn more  Tempur-Pedic and Nectar are two brands that come to mind when considering the best memory foam mattresses.
 Tempur-Pedic is often credited with pioneering foam for sleeping after building on technology created by NASA and offers a number of mattresses in mid-range and luxury price points in varying configurations to suit a wide range of sleepers.
 Nectar is known for its budget-friendly bed-in-a-box options and for helping popularize the yearlong sleep trial and "forever" warranty.
 We tested both the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud both of which cater to individuals of all sleeping preferences.
 In the last few years, Tempur-Pedic introduced its own bed-in-box, or bag, as it actually ships, in the TEMPUR-Cloud, its most economical offering and one of our favorite foam mattresses for all sleep types.
 The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress is an even more price-effective option that caters to side and back sleepers, and those with back pain.
 Read our individual reviews of the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and Tempur-Pedic Cloud mattress.
 Below, we compare these pressure-relieving mattresses based on factors that we rate when considering the best mattresses such as price, design, return policy, warranty, set-up process, comfort, edge support, and motion transfer to help you decide which will be the best option for your sleep habits.
 
                                      The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure.
 It's a premium sleep experience, but with a price tag coming in way under a grand.

                                     
                                      The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation.

 This purportedly provides personalized comfort for different body shapes, sizes, and weights.
 Unlike traditional memory foam mattresses, it doesn't cause you to feel trapped and overheat during the night.
 In terms of construction, the 10-inch TEMPUR-Cloud has a moisture-wicking 360-degree stretch cover followed by a TEMPUR comfort layer for optimal cushioning, a TEMPUR support layer for pressure relief, and a foam base layer for added durability.
  The TEMPUR-Cloud is also available as a hybrid mattress with 1,000 individually wrapped coils between the support and base layer for added bounce and movement.
 Tempur-Pedic's other bedding collections, the TEMPUR-Adapt and the TEMPUR-Breeze are available with enhanced pressure-relieving and cooling properties, respectively, as well as varied firmness options, which are offered at a higher price point.
  The Nectar Memory Foam Mattress features a breathable cooling cover made from heat-absorbent polyethylene fibers followed by CertiPUR-US certified gel-infused memory foam, a three-inch soft, response transition foam layer, a seven-inch ActiveSupport Stability Base layer, and lower cover to keep your mattress in place.
 It's slightly thicker at 12-inches.
  Like Tempur-Pedic, Nectar offers each of its mattresses as a hybrid and has upgraded models, such as the Nectar Premier, which has an extra inch of foam and enhanced cooling features.
 Tempur-Pedic's TEMPUR-Cloud is more expensive in every size compared to the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress.
 At $1,999 for a queen, it's more than twice the price of Nectar mattresses, but it is also the most affordable Tempur-Pedic option.
 Tempur-Pedic will frequently discount the Cloud by 30%.
 The Nectar mattress is valued at $1,099, but it's typically marked down by as much as 40% off.
  Winner: Nectar The only real way to know if you like a new mattress is to sleep on it.
 Tempur-Pedic has a 90-night trial period, so you can test it out and see if it's right for you.
 However, a return shipping fee will apply.
  Tempur-Pedic offers a 10-year full replacement limited warranty which includes a replacement or repair for any damage covered under the warranty at no cost to you.
 When used with a proper, supportive foundation, it covers deterioration from normal wear.
 Some specific instances where you'd be covered by warranty include structural damage or broken components, squeaks and rattles, and sagging not caused by a poor bed frame.
  Nectar has an industry-leading 365-night trial period and offers customers a "forever warranty.
" You'll receive a full refund if you choose to return your mattress during the trial period.
  The "Forever" warranty does have loopholes, however.
 It's only valid for the original purchaser of the mattress, it's void if you remove the cover, and if the mattress is more than 10 years old, Nectar can repair (not replace) it and charge you for shipping both ways.
 Winner: Nectar Once your new mattress arrives at your doorstep, you'll want to get it set up and ready to use as soon as possible, as prolonged compression can damage the bed's ability to expand fully.
 The Nectar comes shrink-wrapped in a box, while the TEMPUR-Cloud arrives in a reusable canvas bag with two handles, making it easier to carry.
  For both the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud, you need to cut through the plastic areas until you reach the mattress and then allow it to expand.
 For the TEMPUR-Cloud, the brand says you'll be able to go to sleep on it in minutes after opening.
 However, Nectar recommends letting the mattress fully expand between 24 and 72 hours before use.
 Both mattresses have that "new bed" smell, but during testing we noticed that dissipated after a few hours.
 In terms of assembly, Nectar offers "Premium In-Home Setup" for $199.
 With this service, the brand works with a local service provider to set up the mattress in your home and remove your old mattress.
 While Tempur-Pedic offers white-glove delivery for its Adapt and Breeze mattresses, the Cloud ships to your doorstep and no in-home setup is available.
 Both mattresses are pretty easy to set up on your own so it's not that big of a hindrance.
 Winner: Tempur-Pedic 
 Comfort is vital when it comes to a mattress, and while overall a subjective assessment, we consider factors like firmness, support, and sleep position to help evaluate.
 Both the Nectar memory foam mattress and the Tempur-Pedic Cloud are suitable for all sleepers (side, back, and stomach), hot sleepers, and those with back pain.
 Our sleep reporter found the Nectar most comfortable on his side, while finding a reasonable amount of comfort on his back and stomach.
 He liked sleeping on his side, back, and stomach, equally, on the Cloud.
  In terms of feel, we noticed the Nectar contoured toward our individual body shape and provided a comfortable cradling effect.
 We sank into the foam, but not enough where it felt like there was no support.
 For the TEMPUR-Cloud, our tester said it was the most comfortable mattress they've ever slept on and contoured to their body regardless of position.
   On the firmness scale, the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress falls at a 6.
5 out of 10, firmness level, according to the brand, but our experience places it as a soft-medium.
 The TEMPUR-Cloud is described by the brand as being "soft where you want it and firm where you need it.
" We deemed it to be medium-firm, which is around a 6.
 It's also suitable for those with back pain.
 Winner: Tempur-Pedic If you're a hot sleeper, then you'll appreciate a mattress with optimal heat dissipation so you're not constantly overheating in bed.
 For the Nectar mattress, we used a laser thermometer to measure the surface temperature of the mattress right before lying down and after getting up.
 The Nectar increased by about 19 degrees when we laid on it, which is about average among mattresses we've tested.
 That said, it was highly effective in dissipating heat, and dropped by nearly 15 degrees when we got up.
  When we tested the TEMPUR-Cloud, we didn't have the thermometer tests in place.
 However, we noticed that it sleeps cool and dissipates heat well.
 We had no heat-related critiques, ranking it as the best memory foam cooling mattress.
 If you're looking for a mattress with even more cooling features from Tempur-Pedic, the LuxeBreeze sleeps up to 10 degrees cooler and features ventilated foam.
 Winner: Tempur-Pedic Edge support is vital when sharing a mattress with a partner because it determines how much usable mattress space there actually is on the mattress, and it can make getting in and out of bed more supportive.
 To test the edge support of the mattresses, we rested on the edge of each mattress and used a yardstick to measure how much the mattress sank.
  During testing we were disappointed in the edge support in the TEMPUR-Cloud and noticed significant sinking toward the edges.
  On the contrary, with the Nectar mattress, we had to actually push ourselves to the side before falling off the bed.
 Plus, when we measured it with a ruler, it sank 3 inches, which is less than a majority of the other mattresses we've tested in the past.
 It's not the firmest edge support out there, but it was more supportive.
 Winner: Nectar Light sleepers and couples who are sensitive to movement will benefit greatly from a mattress with minimal motion transfer.
  To evaluate motion transfer, we placed a can of soda in the center of the mattresses and dropped a bowling ball 4 feet above the beds, letting it land 12 inches from the can.
 With the TEMPUR-Cloud, the can stayed upright every time, which indicates that the mattress had minimal motion transfer.
 For the Nectar mattress, the can barely moved, and the vibrometer picked up fewer vibrations during the process.
 Winner: Tie If you're deciding between the Nectar Memory Foam Mattress and the TEMPUR-Cloud and money is not an issue, the TEMPUR-Cloud is our preferred option.
 Although they both are easy to set up and comfortable to sleep on, the Tempur-Pedic Cloud has a more luxurious feel with its TEMPUR-material and outperformed in almost all evaluations, except edge support.
 Of course, Nectar's pricing and policies make the Nectar a great option for the budget-conscious and those who are comforted by the idea of a lengthy sleep trial and lifetime warranty, leaving little space for any buyer's remorse.
 Both are well-suited to hot sleepers and those with back pain.
 We find the Nectar a a comfortable option for side and back sleepers, while all sleep types can benefit from the TEMPUR-Cloud.
