 BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review: "My hair has never been better! I got this because of TikTok and it has done wonders for my hair.
 My hair isnâ€™t frizzy or dull looking when I get up in the morning.
" â€”Aaron Key Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.
99+Â (available in 36 colors and four sizes).
 Promising review: "When it got here I cleaned it and put it in the freezer.
 I took it out a day later and filled it with Diet Coke just to see what it does.
 Squeeze it a few times and it's 100% a slushy.
 I am shocked and thrilled.
 Worth the money.
 It has some type of ribbing inside that freezes.
 If you enjoy a cold beverage, get it quick.

 Promising review: "I saw one of these in action at a friend's house like five years ago and thought it was just a made up memory, because making ice cream out of solely frozen fruit seems wild.
 But when I saw a TikTok about it I immediately went to Amazon and bought it.
 Literally this was the BEST decision of my life.
 I cannot believe still how amazing this thing is! It makes the creamiest, best-tasting fruit ice cream ever.
 Itâ€™s easy to take apart and clean, and super easy to use.

 FullstarÂ is a small business established in 2017 that specializes in kitchen gadgets.
Â  Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action.
Â  Promising review:Â "Makes life so much easier.
 I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more.
 We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long.
 This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container.

 Reviewers note that these work best if you put them somewhere the flies are already attracted to â€” these will trap them, but they won't attract them on their own.
Â  Promising review:Â "A must for your plants.
 Great for all those fungus gnats near my plants! I saw this shown on a TikTok used in a vivarium enclosure and had to try it.
 Works great and is very attractive-looking.

Â  Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action.
Â  Puracy is a Texas-based, family-owned small business specializing in plant-based, chemical-free, hypoallergenic home products, with a donation made to local families in need with a portion of every purchase.
Â  Promising review: "For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS spilling things on my shirts and I cook every night (sometimes I remember the apron, sometimes I don't).
 My clothes are a mess by the end of the day.
 I'm not proud of it, but there it is.
 I have tried EVERYTHING there is to remove stains and this is the absolute BEST thing out there.
 (There is simply not a major stain remover that I have not tried.
) The only thing close is a long pre-soak (I mean like six hours) in Oxyclean.
 With Puracy, you get the best result by doing it well in advance, but for me that is another plus because I would far rather spray them when I put them in the hamper than do it all at once just before I do the laundry.
 It seems to get everything out and I've never had any trouble with damaged fabric.
 I don't really review very much, but this is seriously outstanding.
" â€”NYC Buyer Get it from Amazon for $12.

 A lot of people compare it to the Magic Eraser in paste form, so even your weirdest, most stubborn stains will meet their match.
 Promising review: "Found this product on TikTok.
 I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen value like I do this product! Literally use it on EVERYTHING!! Kids and teens have dirt, grime, and grease on their walls? .
.
.
This will make it look like a new paint job.
 Baseboards need some love? A pea-size amount of this makes them look brand-new.
 Need a shoe cleaner? PERFECT for sneakers.
 I could name a million more uses, but I can ASSURE you this is worth every penny.
 Whatâ€™s more? You need such LITTLE of this product, it will last a VERY long time.
 Thank you, TikTok!!!" â€”Rachel in CLT Get it from Amazon for $5.

 Promising review: "Love these liners I saw on TikTok! What a time saver!" â€”Angie "I was skeptical but I was also tired of cleaning my air fryer of crumbs all the time.
 I have a PowerXl air fryerÂ and one of these fits perfectly in there.
 I can do French fries or any other fried food and discard the liner and the fryer is still nice and clean.
 I use two when I do juicy items, hot dogs, chicken breast, sausage and when I'm done I take out the meat and lift out the liners and all the gross juice comes out with it leaving the fryer ready to clean in the sink with hot water, no gross juice to pour out or get in the sink.
 I highly recommend.

Â  Promising review: "I LOVE this product so much! I drink iced coffee on the daily but the system I had just wasn't cutting it for me.
 I didn't know how to brew cold coffee at home (all we have is a Keurig, and there's no cold brew option) so I would go buy iced coffee from Dunkin' every morning.
 Now don't get me wrong, i love my Dunkin', but I wanted to find a way to be able to make that same iced coffee at HOME, and I think my wallet and gas tank wanted me to figure that out too.
 I found out about this product through TikTok and it is a GAME CHANGER.
 All you have to do is put coffee grounds in the filter, fill up the main compartment 3/4 full with water (I use water from my fridge), screw the filter into the lid and screw the lid shut, shake it a little to put the coffee grounds to work, and let it do its magic for 12â€“24 hours! This is probably the best investment I've ever made.
 You need this!!" â€”Carmen E.

 Check out a TikTok of the rapid cold brew maker in action.
Â  Promising review: "I like cold brew year-round, which may be my favorite method/machine yet! Itâ€™s so easy to assemble, use, and clean.
Â In about 15 minutes, I was impressed with how rich and bold the brew was, with no grounds like others Iâ€™ve tried.
Â It looks great on my kitchen counter.
 Itâ€™s lightweight and stable with the base suction cups.
 It makes a little noise but much less than I expected (and less than my Nespresso machine).

Â  "Our family unearthed this because beloved To All The Boys I've Loved Before author Jenny Han mentioned that it was her secret to delicious popcorn, and it may have just wrecked me for other at-home popcorn for the rest of my life.
 It genuinely tastes just as salty and buttery and savory as fresh movie theater popcorn.
 I inhaled it so fast that every single one of my organs lit up in mild alarm.
"Â â€”Emma Lord Promising review: "I am a person who will make myself sick eating buckets of popcorn (I have no self-control).
 This has by far been my favorite 'TikTok made me buy' item.
 My at-home popcorn is now my favorite thing to make and I don't need to go the theater for popcorn.
 Very much worth the purchase and this will last me such a long time.
" â€”S Martinez Get it from Amazon for $9.
40Â (available in two other flavors).
 Promising review: "Fancy! Iâ€™m a sucker for gadgets, and well, you know TikTokâ€¦the grands request the 'fancy' hotdogs now when hotdogs are on the menu.
 I didnâ€™t expect them to taste any different, but it upped that game too.

Â  Check out aÂ TikTok of the solar lights in action.
Â  Promising review: "To say I love these lights would be a understatement.
 Theyâ€™re easy to hang, great looking, bright, and they work amazingly!!! On a sunny day, these lights charge enough to stay on from sunset to sunrise.
 Yep! Thatâ€™s right! Theyâ€™re still on until sunrise.
 These are the only brand of solar lights that Iâ€™ve ever purchased that last that long (and Iâ€™ve gone through more than my share of solar light.
).
 These are DEFINITELY worth the price.
 You wonâ€™t be disappointed!! Btw â€” this is the fourth set I purchased; I love them that much.
 The first set I purchased is over a year old and theyâ€™re still working as well as they did on day one.

Â  Check out a TikTok of the condiment fork in action.
Â  Promising review: "Great kitchen item.
 Forks are great to get pickles out of the jar, but if you have kids/lazy people (lol) you know that dirty hands are going into that jar.
 ðŸ˜‰ This has really prevented that from happening.
 It comes with two different rings to fit whatever size jar, a stabber holder, and a stabbing stick.

Â  Promising review: "Yes, I did it.
 I bought the TikTok blender and don't regret it one bit.

 So easy to use, charge and clean.
 It's a must-buy!!!" â€”Debby from Warren Get it from Amazon for $31.

Â  Check out a TikTok of the Beast Blender in action.
Â  Promising review: "I have tried so many blenders, and they all break, or the blending power wonâ€™t be as strong within a few months.
 This blender has been so great the last few months! Itâ€™s super easy to use and super easy to clean.
 Before I purchased the blender, I was worried the blender cup would be too small for my husband's smoothie, but it was a perfect size for us.
 The blending power is amazing, and the blender isnâ€™t loud either!"Â â€”Vanessa Mendez Get it from Amazon for $164.

 Psst â€” you can use these to freeze iced coffee or juice to add to your morning iced coffee or cocktails to cool them without watering them down!Â  Promising review: "I was at a restaurant and they put one of these roses in my cocktail.
 I knew right then I had to make these at home and ordered these while at the restaurant.
 These are easy to fill and have rubber snaps that lock them tight.
 They come right out and you can even take just one out and leave the others for the next time.
 These are a hit at all of my dinner parties too! I have already ordered more as my friends all want these in their drinks!" â€”Siri US Get it from Amazon for $7.

Â  Dan O's seasoning is a small business established in 2017 that gained popularity after taking to TikTok during the pandemic, where the company now has 3.
8 million followers with plenty of droolworthy food content.
  Promising review: "I became interested in this product while watching TikToks.
 I have been adding it to so many things.
 I use it in spaghetti, on fish, and one of my favorites is to add it to popcorn.
 My husband had to ask why my popcorn smelled like steak.
 I love the fact that it is low sodium as well.
 I am not a fan of extra salt and most foods already have plenty of salt but need some seasoning.
 This should be your go to seasoning.

 I love this product! It kept my cooler cold all weekend long.

 I am so impressed that I plan to purchase more Kooler Kubes to give as gifts to my horse show friends.
 Thanks, Kooler Kube, for a product that performs!" â€”Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $16.

Â  It's also a lot more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than wine wands or other competitors â€” a single bottle of this can be used to treat up to 55 glasses of wine, as opposed to wands that can only do a few glasses each before they get tossed.
 Drop It recommends 1â€“2 drops for each glass of white wine, 2â€“3 for a glass of red, and 7â€“9 if you're treating the whole bottle at once.
 Once it's in the glass, swirl lightly for 20 seconds, and you should be raring to go!  Promising review: "I ordered this product after seeing it on TikTok with further investigation.
 And I must say it does work.
 I love sweet wine but will always get a headache the next morning (one glass).
 After using it, I did not have one the next morning.

 Chill-O-Matic is a small business that specializes in beverage accessories.
Â  Check out a TikTok of the Chill-O-Matic in action.
Â  Promising review: "I was so afraid of wasting money.
 But I didnâ€™t.
 I love my sodas cold.
 But sometimes thereâ€™s not a cold one available, and waiting 30-40 min for one to get cold in the freezer is not always ideal.
 This will get your room temp can to fridge cold in 90 seconds.
 I let it run double that to get almost freezer cold.
 I wish it had a power cord.
 But I do appreciate the portability that the batteries provide.
 I canâ€™t wait to try it out on vacationing, as access to cold sodas isnâ€™t always available.
 All you need is a literally a little bit of ice.

Â  Beach State is a small business specializing in premium, high quality beach umbrellas.
Â  Check out a TikTok of the umbrella in action.
Â  Promising review: "This umbrella is exactly what my family was looking for as our everyday beach umbrella â€” large diameter, high quality, and cute retro design.
 It is a higher end umbrella but still slightly less expensive than the other big name designer beach gear company that we were considering.
 It is easy to pop up and stays standing, and weâ€™ve had many compliments from other people at the beach asking where we got it.
 The customer service from the company was excellent.
 Would definitely recommend these umbrellas!" â€”Taryn Get it from Amazon for $170Â (available in seven colors).
Â  Check out a TikTok of the tabletop fire pit in action.

Â  Promising review: "This little utensil is adorable, and quite practical.
 When I saw it on TikTok I knew I had to have one.

Â  Promising review:Â "Love this bottle/soda maker.
 I am obsessed with fizzy drinks and cannot take my bulkier at-home maker with me to work or when I travel.
 This maker allowed me the compact convenience of taking my fizzy drinks everywhere I go.
 I can control what I put in my body and always get my flavors I love.
