Deputy Inspector Paul Zangrilli, who led a police precinct in Manhattan, is accused of trying to cover up the 2022 wreck by acts including switching seats with his girlfriend after the wreck and then offering the cab driver money. Zangrilli pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyer, Eric Franz, didn't immediately respond to phone messages from The Associated Press but told some news outlets Zangrilli was a respected inspector who has been waiting two years to \u201c clear his good name.\u201d Manhattan prosecutors said Zangrilli was out drinking with his girlfriend on a summer night when he let her drive his unmarked police vehicle. She crashed into a cab, then, with Zangrilli in the passenger seat, sped away from the scene, Manhattan prosecutors said. Instead of turning his girlfriend in, prosecutors said Zangrilli switched seats with her, then kept driving. When the cab driver caught up with them at a red light and flagged down another police officer, prosecutors said Zangrilli repeatedly offered $500 or $1,000 to the cab driver rather than exchange insurance information. Then, prosecutors said, Zangrilli called an NYPD captain and told a series of lies: that he had been driving alone and was on his way to work when the crash happened. Prosecutors allege that he soon signed into work at his own precinct and called the owner of the bar asking him to erase video footage that would capture the couple's three-hour drinking session. \u201cThis alleged behavior was incredibly dangerous, leading to injuries for one cab driver and putting the safety of many other drivers and pedestrians at risk. Furthermore, this NYPD Deputy Inspector, then a Commanding Officer, allegedly went to great lengths to cover up the incident to avoid responsibility,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to hold public servants accountable when they violate the public trust.\u201d Zangrilli is charged with various felonies, including tampering with evidence, offering a false instrument for filing and falsifying business records. He's also charged with drinking while driving and misdemeanors related to misconduct and obstruction. Zangrilli's date was also charged with drunken driving and pleaded not guilty.  In 2023, Zangrilli earned around $200,000 in base pay and other compensation, according to New York City public salary records.  Zangrilli was suspended without pay, the NYPD said in a statement. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"R.J.

The gated micro community known as \u201cThe Melody\u201d doesn't look like a parking lot anymore. Artificial turf is spread across the asphalt. Potted plants and red Adirondack chairs abound. There's even a dog park. The shipping containers have been divided into 40 insulated studio apartments that include a single bed, HVAC unit, desk, microwave, small refrigerator, TV, sink and bathroom. On a recent afternoon, a half-dozen residents were chatting around a table in The Melody's smoking area. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful,\u201d said Cynthia Diamond, a 61-year-old former line cook who uses a wheelchair and used to be chronically homeless. \"I have my own door key. I ain't got to worry about nobody knocking on my door, telling me when to eat, sleep or do anything. I\u2019m going to stay here as long as the Lord allows me to stay here.\u201d Faced with years of rising homelessness rates and failed solutions, city officials across the U.S. have been embracing rapid housing options emphasizing three factors: small, quick and cheap. Officials believe micro communities, unlike shelters, offer stability that, when combined with wraparound services, can more effectively put residents on the path to secure housing.  Denver has opened three micro communities and converted another five hotels for people who used to be homeless. In Austin, Texas, there are three villages of \u201ctiny homes.\" In Los Angeles, a 232-unit complex features two three-floor buildings of stacked shipping containers.  \u201cHousing is a ladder. You start with the very first rung. Folks that are literally sleeping on the ground aren't even on the first rung,\u201d said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, sitting in one of the city's new micro communities that offer tiny, transitional homes for that first rung. More than 1,500 people have been moved indoors through the program, with over 80% still in the housing as of last month, according to city data. The inexpensive units are particularly a boon for cities with high housing costs, where moving that many people directly into apartments wouldn\u2019t be financially feasible.  Both Atlanta\u2019s and Denver\u2019s program act as a stepping stone as they work to get people jobs and more permanent housing, with Denver aiming to move people out within six months. That includes Eric Martinez, 28, who has been in limbo between the street and the bottom rung for most of his life. At birth Martinez was flung into the revolving door of foster care, and he's wrestled with substance use while surfing couches and pitching tents. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of demeaning, it makes me feel less of a person,\u201d said Martinez, his eyes downcast. \u201cI had to get out of it and look out for myself at that point: It\u2019s fight or flight, and I flew.\u201d Martinez\u2019s Denver tent encampment was swept and he along with the others were directed into the micro communities of small cabin-like structures with a twin bed, desk and closet. The city built three such communities with nearly 160 units total in about six months, at roughly $25,000 per unit, said Johnston. The 1,000 converted hotel units cost about $100,000 each. On site at the micro community are bathrooms, showers, washing machines, small dog parks and kitchens, though the Salvation Army delivers meals. The program represents an about-face from policies that for years focused on short-term group shelters and the ceaseless shuffle of encampments from one city block to the next. That system made it difficult to keep people who were scattered through the city connected to services and on the path to permanent housing. Those services in Denver's and Atlanta's micro communities are largely centralized. They offer residents case management, counseling, mental health and substance abuse therapy, housing guidance and assistance obtaining anything from vocational skills training to a new pair of dentures. \u201cWe\u2019re able to meet every level of the hierarchy of needs \u2014 from security and shelter, all the way up to self-actualization and the sense of community,\u201d said Peter Cumiskey, the Atlanta site clinician. The Melody, and projects like it, are a \u201cvery promising, feasible and cost-effective way\u201d to tackle homelessness, said Michael Rich, an Emory University political science professor who studies housing policy. Rich noted that transitional housing is still just the first step toward permanent housing.  The programs in Denver and Atlanta, taking inspiration from similar ones in cities like Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, offer a degree of privacy and security not found in congregate shelters or encampments. Giving each resident their own bathroom and kitchen is a crucial feature that helps set The Melody apart, said Cathryn Vassell, whose nonprofit, Partners For Home, oversees the micro community. Aside from a prohibition on overnight guests, staff emphasize the tenants are treated as independent residents. Vassell acknowledged it's unclear how long the containers will last \u2014 she's hoping 20 years. But, she said, they were the right choice for The Melody because they were relatively inexpensive and already had handicap-accessible bathrooms since many were used by Georgia hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The project, which took only about four months to complete, cost about $125,000 per unit \u2014 not \u201ctremendously inexpensive,\u201d Vassell said, but less than traditional construction, and much quicker. Staffing and security operations cost about $900,000 a year.  The Melody is the first part of Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens' target of supplying 500 units of rapid housing on city-owned land by December 2025. A 2023 \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d count found there were 738 unsheltered people in Atlanta, far fewer than many cities, but still an increase over the previous year. \u201cWe need more Melodies as fast as possible,\u201d said Courtney English, the mayor's chief policy officer.  Few objected when The Melody was announced last year, but as city officials seek to expand the rapid-housing footprint, they know local pushback is likely. That's what Denver faced. Mayor Johnston said he attended at least 60 town halls in six months as Denver tried to identify locations for the new communities and faced pushback from local residents worried about trash and safety. \u201cWhat they are worried about is their current experience of unsheltered homelessness,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe had to get them to see not the world as it used to exist, but the world as it could exist, and now we have the proof points of what that could be.\" The scars of life on the street still stick with Martinez. All his belongings are prepped for a move at a moment's notice, even though he feels secure in his tiny home alongside his cat, Appa.  The community has been \u201cvery uplifting and supporting,\u201d he said, pausing. \"You don\u2019t get that a lot.\u201d On his wall is a calendar with a job orientation penciled in. The next step is working with staff to get a housing voucher for an apartment. \u201cI\u2019m always looking down on myself for some reason,\u201d he said. But \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job. Everyone is pretty proud of me.\u201d ___  Bedayn reported from Denver. ____ Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press\/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday invalidated a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, ruling the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrongly classified firearms equipped with a bump stock as machine guns. The 6-3 opinion was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court's three liberal justices, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. The court ruled a semiautomatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a \"machinegun\" under federal law \"because it does not fire more than one shot 'by a single function of the trigger.'\" \"This case asks whether a bump stock -- an accessory for a semiautomatic rifle that allows the shooter to rapidly reengage the trigger (and therefore achieve a high rate of fire) -- converts the rifle into a 'machinegun.' We hold that it does not,\" Thomas wrote.  More than 700,000 bump stocks were sold since 2009 after the Obama-era ATF approved the manufacture and sale. The bump stock, which is non-mechanical, can simulate an automatic weapon, firing 400-800 rounds per minute. A fully automatic weapon, such as a M16 rifle, shoots 700-950 rounds per minute. The ATF ban on the accessory was created in the wake of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history when a gunman opened fire at Las Vegas music festival in 2017. Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds of others wounded. Sotomayor, in her dissent, noted the gunman in that tragedy used the device to create rapid fire. \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"A bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle fires 'automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.'\" Sotomayor added, \"Today's decision to reject that ordinary understanding will have deadly consequences. The majority's artificially narrow definition hamstrings the Government's efforts to keep machineguns from gunmen like the Las Vegas shooter.\" Bump stock inventor Jeremiah Cottle, who previously spoke to ABC News about his controversial firearm accessory, called the court's decision a \"good ruling\" and personal \"vindication.\" \"I think we have a violence problem in this country. I don't think we have a gun problem,\" Cottle said. \"I think it's a balance problem. And I think to blame it on an inanimate object is irresponsible.\" Plaintiff Michael Cargill, a Texas gun store owner, told ABC News the case was \"not just about firearms\" but government overreach. \"They cannot walk into my house and tell me something that I owned, that I purchased, all of a sudden, years later, it's illegal and they decide to ban it,\" Cargill said. \"They can't do that.\" Gun control advocates, on the other hand, decried the ruling. \"This decision by the high court is dangerous and wrong. The ATF must be undeterred in continuing to aggressively enforce our nation's gun laws,\" Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, said in a statement.  President Joe Biden, in the wake of the ruling, issued a statement calling on Congress to ban bump stocks as well as assault weapons. But given the narrow partisan divide on Capitol Hill, the influence of the gun lobby and election-year campaign politics -- immediate legislative action in response to the court's ruling is unlikely, even though a ban did have some bipartisan support in 2017. Trump's campaign said the court's decision \"should be respected\" and that the \"right to keep and bear arms has never been more critical.\" The statement, however, did not address the fact that the ATF imposed the ban during his administration.

The Marion County Sheriff's Office released video of detectives questioning Susan Lorincz, the Florida woman charged in the fatal shooting of Ajike \"AJ\" Owens, a Black mother of four who lived across the street from Lorincz. The video, released on Monday, showed the moment Lorincz, who is white, was arrested after an almost two-hour long interrogation four days after the fatal incident. Following the shooting, Lorincz told detectives she was acting in self-defense when she shot Owens, who was with her 10-year-old son, through the closed door of Lorincz's home on June 2, 2023, according to the video. \"She was saying 'I'm going to kill you,'\" Lorincz told detectives about Owens during the interrogation. \"There was banging. There was yelling. I thought she was going to just break down the door,\" she said. \"My heart was pounding and I thought, 'she's really going to kill me.'\" According to detectives, no other witnesses heard Owens shouting threats during the dispute. \"No one that we've interviewed so far has made any statements about her saying that she wanted to kill you,\" one of the detectives told Lorincz. Lorincz was charged with first-degree manslaughter in Owens' death and a trial is expected to begin on August 12. She pleaded not guilty and remains in custody. On the night of the incident, Lorincz called 911 at 8:54 pm to report Owens' kids trespassing on her property in Ocala, Florida, according to records obtained by detectives. After approximately five minutes on the phone, the 911 dispatcher informed Lorincz that deputies were on their way. At 9:01 pm, less than two minutes after hanging up with 911 dispatchers, Lorincz called again to say she had shot Owens, according to police records. Police said Owens had gone to Lorincz's home to speak with her about the dispute involving Owens' children playing near her home.  Detectives later questioned Lorincz about her online search history, according to the video of the interrogation, asking her if she'd looked up self-defense laws in Florida. She told detectives she'd done so earlier that day after seeing an article on Facebook. \"I know what you're thinking. Did I look up the law so that I could do something? No,\" Lorincz told detectives in the video. During the interrogation, Lorincz told detectives she'd only communicated with Owens about two or three times since the mother of four moved across the street and repeatedly denied ever using racial slurs towards Owens and her children on the night of the shooting. Body camera footage released last July by the Marion County Sheriff's Office showed seven incidents between Feb. 25, 2022, and April 25, 2023, in which Lorincz called sheriff's deputies to complain about neighborhood children, including Owens' children, playing near her home. The body camera videos show a child alleging in comments to sheriff's deputies that Lorincz called the children in the neighborhood racial slurs and another who accused Lorincz of being \"racist.\" Lorincz admitted to calling children in the neighborhood racial slurs and other derogatory terms in the past, according to a police report. \"I feel that there was a level of fear,\" one of the detectives told Lorincz about the night of the shooting. \"But from everything I've seen, it doesn't rise to the level for you to justify shooting through a closed door with a firearm, and I think you know that wasn't reasonable.\" \"But there were times I called and deputies never showed up,\" Lorincz responded. The detective responded by saying, \"it was two minutes\" and she said, \"to me, it wasn't two minutes.\"  \"I'm not taking away how you were treated,\" the detective told Lorincz. \"But those are children nonetheless, and now they don't have a mother to go home to and I think you know what you did was wrong and I think you know there were already deputies on the way.\" Lorincz initially refused arrest after detectives brought in a Marion County deputy to transport her to jail, the video showed. After repeated attempts to persuade her to cooperate, she told detectives, \"I don't care. Kill me,\" the video shows. Before Lorincz was arrested, detectives gave her an opportunity to write a letter to Owens' children, according to the video. \"I am so sorry for your loss. I never meant to kill your mother. I was terrified your mom was going to kill me. I shot out of fear,\" Lorincz wrote, according to detectives in the video. Attorneys for Lorincz and Owens' family did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Julia Jacobo","title":"This distinct polar bear population could soon go extinct: Study","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/prolonged-ice-free-periods-putting-hudson-bay-polar\/story?id=111057322","description":"A unique population of polar bears is at risk of extinction should ice-free periods continue to get longer, researchers have determined.","date":"2024-06-13T15:49:03Z","content":"Polar bears' primary prey, the ringed seal, are also at risk. A segment of the polar bear population is at risk of extinction should ice-free periods continue to get longer, researchers have determined using analysis of the sea ice as well as the health of the bears themselves. Ice-free periods in Canada's Hudson Bay have been lengthening over the past few decades, scientists say. Global warming is projected to extend the ice-free periods even more, reducing the ability for the region's resident polar bear population to hunt, putting them at risk of extinction if greenhouse gas emissions continue at projected levels, a study published in Communications Earth & Environment on Thursday found. The Hudson Bay is historically one of the few places in the Arctic where polar bears have routinely come ashore when all of the sea ice has melted, Geoff York, senior director of research and policy of Polar Bears International and co-author of the paper, told ABC News. What used to be an ice-free period of about four months has now extended far beyond, to the point that the polar bears in the southern and western Hudson Bay have been stretched to the point of genetic adaptation and the length of time they can fast, York said. Today's Hudson Bay polar bears are spending five weeks or longer on land than their grandparents did, York said.  Collar cameras strapped to Hudson Bay polar bears showed that the longer extents of ice-free periods are putting the Hudson Bay polar bears at risk of starvation, according to a paper published in Nature earlier this year. Polar bears that were forced to find food on land -- by foraging on berries and eating birds -- lost about the same amount of weight as the bears that simply fasted, proving that to these bears, food on land had nowhere near the same amount of nutrients as seals, which are full of fat and blubber, the researchers found. \"Their primary food sources require them to be out on the sea ice,\" Alex Crawford, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba's Department of Environment and Geography and co-author of the paper, told ABC News. \"So that means that if they are spending [a] longer time on land in the summer, they are spending a longer amount of time effectively fasting.\"  The early disappearance of sea ice, now in the late spring and early months, occurs at the same time that pups are being born and when mother bears put on most of their fat that will get them through the winter, York said. Putting them on shore early puts them in a precarious body condition for the upcoming cold months. \"Females are going to be less successful taking a pregnancy to term,\" York said. \"Even if they do carry it to term, they'll be less successful in raising those cubs in the first year.\" Between 1.6 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-Industrial times is the range in which the Hudson Bay polar bears are expected to go extinct, Crawford said. \"That low end, we're knocking on the door of that already,\" Crawford said.  The paper brings together the latest climate models with two components that greatly affect polar bear survivability -- snow depth and ice thickness -- for the first time, York said. Ringed seals, polar bears' primary source of prey, need adequate snow depth to successfully den and protect their young in the springtime. Even when accounting for bias in the climate models, the paper's findings were still grim, Crawford said. Predictions made in the early \u201890s about warming impacts on polar bears are happening sooner than expected, York said.  Researchers have observed \"dramatic\" drops in the Hudson Bay subpopulation of up to 26% in the last decade, York said. There are only about half the number of polar bears in the population than 40 years ago. \"That decline is already kind of in progress, and if anything, I think now we'll see it likely accelerating,\" York said. There is a chance for the sea ice to recover drastically, Crawford said. If greenhouse gas emissions were to stop altogether, the extent of the sea ice could reverse in just a matter of years, Crawford said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Tanya Stukalova","title":"Wall Street Journal reporter to stand trial in Russia on espionage charges","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-stand-trial\/story?id=111089746","description":"In a setback to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, the Russian prosecutor\u2019s office announced Thursday he will stand trial on espionage charges.","date":"2024-06-13T13:29:38Z","content":"The decision is a setback for the American taken into custody in March 2023. In a setback to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, the Russian prosecutor's office announced Thursday he will stand trial on espionage charges, officially ending any future pre-detention appeals. \"The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation has approved an indictment in the criminal case against US citizen Evan Gershkovich,\" the office said in a statement. \"The criminal case has been sent to the Sverdlovsk Regional Court for consideration on the merits.\" It continued, \"The investigation established and documented that the American journalist of The Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich, on the instructions of the CIA in March 2023, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region about the activities of the defense enterprise JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod for the production and repair of military equipment.\"  Gershkovich has denied he was involved in any espionage and the U.S. State Department has declared him to be wrongfully detained. The statement Thursday marks the first time prosecutors have publicly accused Gershkovich of working for the CIA, alleging without evidence that he was collecting \"secret information\" on a tank factory in the Sverdlovsk region. Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal, the U.S. government and Gershkovich's many colleagues all vehemently dispute he was working as a spy and say that he was doing his job as a reporter. Gershkovich was on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg, the capital of the Sverdlovsk region, when he was arrested in March 2023. Previously, prosecutors have alleged Gershkovich was working for a foreign intelligence service without specifying which one. \"Evan Gershkovich is facing a false and baseless charge,\" Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal publisher, and Emma Tucker, Wall Street Journal editor in chief, said in a joint statement published in The Wall Street Journal. \"Russia's latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous.\" They added, \"Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime's smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan's case is an assault on free press.\"  In March, Gershkovich's parents had told ABC News they were optimistic about progress in their son's case. \"We know that the U.S. government is taking Evan's case very seriously,\" his mother, Ella Milman, told \"Good Morning America\" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive sit-down interview. \"I think if you let the pessimism in ... the game is over,\" she said. \"And our saying in the family is we're moving forward. Moving forward.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first comments on Gershkovich's detention in months on June 5. \"I know that the United States administration is really taking energetic steps for his release. This is true. But such issues are not resolved through the media,\" Putin said. \"They love such a quiet, calm professional approach and dialogue between the intelligence services.\" He added, \"You know, you believe that he is innocent, and Russian law enforcement agencies and special services believe that he committed illegal actions, which are called espionage. I will not go into details.\" Gershkovich most recently appeared in court in Moscow for a pretrial hearing on April 23 as part of an appeal against the spying charges. His appeal was denied and he was ordered held through at least June 30.  The reporter smiled and gave a thumb's up when asked by ABC News inside the courtroom how he was doing. \"He has one more appeal that he can make, appealing his detention, but what's most likely going to happen before the 30th of June is Evan will be moved from Lefortovo, where he is currently held in prison, to instead Yekaterinburg, and when he gets out to Yekaterinburg, that's when the trial process most likely will start,\" U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Thursday during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Carstens continued: \"I will tell you, if it's anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there will be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won't have any contact with him. It'll almost be like it's gone dark.\" The U.S. has been negotiating the release of both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan since not long after their detentions. Whelan, a former U.S. Marine, was also accused of spying in 2018 and convicted in June 2020. Like Gershkovich, he has been declared wrongfully detained by the U.S. government. \"We're going to continue to try to pursue his release,\" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Thursday of Gershkovich. \"We put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said publicly, we're continuing to work to secure their release.

After a congressional hearing on Wednesday on safety concerns over the V-22 Osprey, during which a military leader said the aircraft will remain under safety restrictions until 2025, grieving families of fallen service members voiced frustration over unanswered questions and demanded accountability in an interview with ABC News. Lawmakers on the House Oversight subcommittee on national security pressed Pentagon witnesses on the deadly history of the aircraft throughout the hearing. \"The total number of fatalities that I'm tracking is 54 fatalities ... and 93 injuries,\" said Vice Adm. Carl Chebi, head of U.S. Naval Air Systems Command, which oversees the Osprey for the entire U.S. military. After a string of fatal V-22 crashes between 2022 and 2023, Chebi decided to ground Osprey flights to give time for investigators to identify potential problems and come up with safety recommendations. The military lifted the flight ban in early 2024, after instituting several new protocols and restrictions. In June 2022, five Marines were killed after a clutch problem caused a failure in the right engine of their V-22 during a training flight over Glamis, California, a military investigation found. Some of the changes that came out of Chebi's safety stand-down were designed to address this problem, both by giving flight crews updated protocols on how to handle clutch problems and by preventatively replacing key parts before they could become too worn. But on Wednesday, Chebi said that the risk posed by the clutch problem will not be eliminated until a redesign is completed, which could take more than a year, and he will not lift the restrictions on Osprey flights until then. \"I will not certify the V-22 to return to unrestricted flight operations until I am satisfied that we have sufficiently addressed the issues that may affect the safety of the aircraft. Based on the data that I have today, I'm expecting that this will not occur before mid 2025,\" he said. Chebi said he has also ordered a comprehensive review of the Pentagon's Osprey program, which will take another six to nine months to be completed. Several family members of Marines killed in the 2022 tragedy traveled to attend Wednesday's hearing, and could be seen holding photos of their deceased loved ones in their seats directly behind the witnesses. \"The families submitted some questions that we had hoped to be answered,\" Amber Sax, wife of Capt. John Sax, told ABC News after the hearing. \"Not all of them were answered. I would say the majority actually were not, unfortunately.\" Sax would also like answers from the companies that make the Osprey. And she's not alone. Last month, she and family members of the other Marines killed in the 2022 catastrophe filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing, Rolls Royce and Bell Textron, which are each involved in producing the aircraft. The companies have said they can't comment on pending litigation. \"We have many questions for them that we hope that they will answer and that will come to light,\" Sax said. \"And I believe that they're the people that should be sitting in those seats next time.\" \"We don't want someone else to have to go through what we've been going through for the last two years now. Something has got to change. Something definitely has to change,\" said Michelle Strickland, mother of Lance Cpl. Evan Strickland, who was 19 when he was killed in the crash. Evan's father agreed. \"We stand together as families to hold accountable those that owe us answers,\" said Brett Strickland. \"We have to be their voice, because they no longer have one.\" While the military has other aircraft that could possibly take on the missions currently carried out by the V-22, the Osprey stands out for its ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but also fly fast like a conventional airplane by changing the angle of its propellers. Timothy Loranger, an attorney at Wisner Baum representing the families, echoed lawmakers who advocated the military prioritize safety by using helicopters to replace Ospreys, until more problems have been worked out. \"They should, as they were asked, consider grounding the aircraft, using some alternative platform like the CH-53 [helicopter] or something else that they know is reliable,\" Loranger said.  The Gold Star families who spoke to ABC News after the hearing opened up about the strong character of their lost loved ones. \"He was kind, he was so genuine ... he had such a zest for life. Everything was like an adventure to him ... He was just so genuine and just a pure spirit,\" said Michelle Strickland of her son. His father spoke about with the lengths to which the young Marine would go to for his friends, from walking miles in the dark to be there for someone after a breakup, to \"just lightening the mood a little bit with this goofiness.\" Amber Sax said of her late husband, \"John grew up with a love for flight. He loved his family very deeply. He loved his country very dearly.\" The family members are not trying to get rid of the Osprey their loved ones flew; they just want it to fly at its best. \"A few short months before losing John, we celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary by getting an ultrasound to see our youngest daughter, who went on to arrive three months after his passing,\" Sax said in written testimony submitted to the House Oversight subcommittee ahead of Wednesday's hearing. Just after the hearing, she told ABC News, \"I want to be able to take my daughters to an air show someday -- John loved going to air shows, and he would have taken them if he were here -- and I want them to be able to see an Osprey flying and say 'That's flying because my daddy and other brave people made it safer for them to fly.'\" 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Kelsey Walsh, Lalee Ibssa, Soo Rin Kim","title":"Trump yet to clarify his abortion pill policy as SCOTUS rules on mifepristone","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-clarify-abortion-pill-policy-scotus-rules-mifepristone\/story?id=111093705","description":"As the Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill mifepristone in an unanimous decision, Donald Trump has yet to disclose his own abortion pill policy.","date":"2024-06-13T18:46:59Z","content":"Trump has said he'd soon release abortion pill policy details, but hasn't yet. Even as the U.S. Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill mifepristone in a unanimous decision on Thursday, former President Donald Trump has yet to disclose his own abortion pill policy. For months, Trump has teased that he'd release policy details pertaining to the issue soon, but that moment has yet to come. Trump has been vague when it comes to reproductive rights as he himself acknowledges the importance of not alienating voters with his position in order to win elections. However, his comments come in an election year as abortion and contraception access remain key issues for many voters headed into November's election.  Trump's campaign pushed back, saying that the former president has been \"very clear.\" \"He supports the rights of states to make decisions on abortion, and supports exceptions for abortions in cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. When the unanimous decision came down Thursday morning, the former president was meeting with congressional Republicans, but sources said he did not mention the ruling directly. Instead, he spoke of the Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 -- a landmark decision that he takes credit for. \"We did that -- it was an incredible thing, an incredible achievement. We did that. And now the states have it, and the states are putting out what they want. It's the will of the people,\" Trump said previously of the court's vote to overrule Roe v. Wade. On the Supreme Court decision, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez said, \u201cThe Supreme Court has unanimously decided 9-0. The matter is settled.\" Trump has said abortion restriction decisions should be up to the states and insisted he believes in three exceptions: rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. He has not said if he personally favors a certain number of weeks into pregnancy at which state-level bans should take effect, though he has publicly criticized a six-week ban in Florida and, more recently, talked privately about the idea of a national 16-week ban with exceptions, sources told ABC News in February. Earlier this week, Trump spoke at the Life & Liberty Forum hosted by the Danbury Institute, an organization that says it promotes Judeo-Christian values and opposes abortion -- where he did not mention abortion. Trump told the group he'd stand by their side and vaguely told the anti-abortion group they would make a \"comeback\" if he's reelected.  \"These are going to be your years because you're going to make a comeback like just about no other group,\" Trump said to the group. Last month, Trump faced backlash as he tried to walk back comments he made suggesting he's open to restricting contraceptives. \"Well, we're looking at that and we're going to have a policy on that very shortly,\" Trump said during an interview with Pittsburgh TV station KDKA-TV. \"And I think it's something you'll find interesting and it's another issue that's very interesting.\" Again, in late April, during an interview with TIME, Trump said he would have a statement out in two weeks explaining his position on mifepristone; however, when pressed on when the delayed announcement would be revealed, campaign sources told ABC News it would happen soon.  President Joe Biden has been more clear on the issue. Biden has made abortion a key issue in what is expected to be a tight race, and Vice President Kamala Harris has capitalized on the issue on the campaign trail. Biden has blamed Trump for the spread of abortion bans since the end of Roe v. Wade, encouraging voters to support reproductive rights -- and him -- in November. \"[Trump is] wrong, the Supreme Court was wrong. It should be a constitutional right in the federal Constitution, a federal right, and it shouldn't matter where in America you live,\" Biden said in a speech in April. \"This isn't about states' rights, this is about women's rights.\" Democratic National Committee press secretary Emilia Rowland emphasized the stakes of the election, specifically toward reproductive freedoms. She said in a statement that the Supreme Court's decision on Thursday \"does not change the fact that because of Trump, millions of women in states across the country cannot access the health care they need,\" Biden on Thursday reminded voters that the fight for women's reproductive freedom is not over. \"Today's decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues,\" Biden said in a statement. \"It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom.\" Leavitt, with the Trump campaign, said \"Joe Biden does not have any good policy of his own, so his failing campaign peddles lies about President Trump's views in a dishonest attempt to fear voters into supporting him.\" ABC News' Rachel Scott, Jay O'Brien, John Parkinson, Benjamin Siegel and Lauren Peller contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Lalee Ibssa, Lauren Peller, Soo Rin Kim, Rachel Scott","title":"Trump assails DOJ in Washington strategy session with Republicans","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-returning-washington-plot-2nd-term-strategy-republican\/story?id=111064855","description":"Sources say he called the Department of Justice \"dirty bastards.\"","date":"2024-06-13T18:41:40Z","content":"Trump said, \"I'm with them 1,000%, they're with me 1,000%.\" Donald Trump made a rare appearance in Washington on Thursday to lay out his second-term agenda to Republican lawmakers as he continues to stress party unity in the wake of his historic felony conviction and a month from becoming the party's official nominee. The former president spent the day just blocks away from the U.S. Capitol to attend a slate of meetings with GOP allies. First, he huddled with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club. The meeting was behind closed doors, but multiple sources told ABC News the former president praised House Speaker Mike Johnson as doing a \"good job.\" Trump also criticized the Department of Justice as \"dirty bastards\" as he aired grievances about his legal challenges.  The meeting unfolded as the Supreme Court handed down a major decision preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Sources told ABC News Trump did not mention the decision directly, but did discuss his view that abortion access should be decided by the states. He also insisted he believed in three exceptions to abortion restrictions: rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Politically, Trump told Republicans they could have a 40-seat majority in the House if they weren't so \"afraid\" of the issue, according to sources. He also went after Democrats like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Rep. Liz Cheney, sources said. Both Pelosi and Cheney, despite being on opposite sides of the aisle, are staunch critics of the former president. Later on Thursday, Trump met with Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters. After the meeting, he touted party unity in on-camera remarks but took no questions from reporters. \"This is an outstanding group of people. I'm with them 1,000%, they're with me 1,000%. We agree just about on everything and if there isn't, we work it out,\" Trump said. In a show of force, Trump was joined by a large group of senators, including Sens. Rick Scott, Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Marsha Blackburn, and many others. Sens. Tim Scott and J.D. Vance, two vice presidential hopefuls, were also there to support Trump. \"We want to see just success for our country,\" Trump said. \"And we don't have success right now.\" Trump has stayed off the U.S. Capitol campus entirely since he left office shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. His return on Thursday prompted President Joe Biden and Democrats to highlight the riot. The Biden-Harris campaign released a new advertisement claiming Trump is trying to \"burn it all down\" with footage of the Capitol riot. The former president said while Democrats accuse Republicans of being \"a bad example of democracy,\" they're the ones who \"are getting away with murder.\" The Senate Republican discussion marked the first time since 2020 that Minority Mitch McConnell and Trump met face-to-face. McConnell and Trump have a rocky relationship, heightened after McConnell recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the wake of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But McConnell, walking back to the U.S. Capitol building afterward, called it a \"positive meeting.\" \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit and shook hands a few times,\" McConnell said. \"He got a lot of standing ovations. It was an entirely positive meeting. Mitt Romney was there as well.\"  Johnson has more openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November's election and a potential second Trump presidency. \"I think it's important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,\" Johnson said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"I believe he'll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy.\" At that news conference, Johnson also told ABC News he supports a bill that would allow current or former presidents to move state charges against them into federal court -- a measure aimed at showing support for Trump after being found guilty in his hush money trial in a New York state court. \"I think that's an idea that makes sense. It makes sense to most Republicans, and I think almost everyone will be in favor of that.\" After the Thursday morning meeting, Johnson said that Trump \"didn't bring up that specific piece of legislation.\" \"He did talk about his concern about the lawfare that's been waged against him -- and we all know it -- and I made the point in my introduction that it's backfired fantastically,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump has become a symbol of pushing back against corruption, the deep state of the weaponization of judicial system and that's a very encouraging development. So, I think that he made the point every time they indicted him, his polls went up.\"  However, not every Republican fully welcomed back Trump when he came to the nation's capital. Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who have been vocal Trump critics, blamed previous conflicts as a reason for why they couldn't attend the meeting with Trump. The two voted with Democrats to impeach Trump for his actions related to Jan. 6. As he was in Washington, Trump also participated in a moderated discussion at a quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group consisting of more than 200 CEOs. Business Roundtable spokesman Michael Steel said the group invited both presumptive presidential nominees, but with Biden overseas to attend the G7 summit, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients joined the meeting in his absence. Some of the country's top executives attended the meeting, including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, Edison International CEO Pedro Pizarro and Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier, according to the executives' representatives or ABC News' observations outside the roundtable building. According to a spokesperson for the Business Roundtable, roughly 100 executives out of more than 200 members of the roundtable attended the meeting, which the spokesperson said was normal for their quarterly meetings like this. During his meeting with business leaders, Trump talked about tax cuts for corporations, as well as not taxing tip wages, according to people familiar with the meeting. Overall, those familiar with the meeting with Trump described it as \"business-like\" and that \"there wasn't a lot new from him today.\" ABC News' John Parkinson, Benjamin Siegel and Mariam Khan contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Mark Osborne","title":"Titan submersible implosion investigation taking longer than planned: Coast Guard","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/titan-submersible-implosion-investigation-accident-taking-longer-planned\/story?id=111132353","description":"The investigation into the ill-fated Titan submersible's dive to the location of the Titanic will now take longer than expected, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.","date":"2024-06-14T17:47:08Z","content":"The submersible imploded on a trip to the Titanic last year.

Five people were killed when the OceanGate submersible imploded in June 2023, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The Coast Guard gave two reasons for the delay, including \"the need to contract two salvage missions to secure vital evidence and the extensive forensic testing required.\" \"We're grateful for the international and interagency cooperation which has been vital in recovering, preserving and forensically testing evidence from a remote offshore region and extreme depth,\" Neubauer added in the statement. \"The MBI is committed to ensuring that we fully understand the factors that led to this tragedy in order to prevent similar occurrences in the future.\"  The Coast Guard also sent best wishes to the families of the victims ahead of the anniversary of the implosion on June 19. In addition to Rush, those killed on the vessel included: Titanic researcher Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British businessman Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman. OceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations after the deadly implosion. While the investigation into what caused the fatal incident continues, outside experts previously called the carbon fiber construction of the Titan fundamentally flawed and a whistleblower who worked on a predecessor to the Titan vessel raised concerns about the inefficiency of the hull design. Rush had previously defended the decision to manufacture the submersible with carbon fiber, saying he believed it would have a better strength-to-buoyancy ratio than titanium.

As Donald Trump turns 78 on Friday, his campaign is trying to paint 2024 rival President Joe Biden as mentally incompetent by distorting a moment from Biden's trip overseas this week to the G7 summit that has gone viral on social media. \"From Italy to the United Kingdom to New York, millions of people around the world woke up to headlines about Crooked Joe Biden's cognitive decline on full display at the G7 Summit,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement. Leavitt was referring to a skydiving demonstration Biden attended on Thursday alongside other world leaders gathered in Italy. Footage from the event was selectively edited in a misleading way by the New York Post.  The Post made it seem as if Biden was speaking to no one before the Italian prime minister ushered him back to the group. In a caption, the New York Post wrote that Biden appeared to \"wander off\" and someone needed to \"pull him back to focus.\" \"Biden was seen staring off into the distance and wandering around like a brain-dead zombie, and even had to be ushered by Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni,\" Leavitt claimed. The edited video posted by the tabloid to X had 4.7 million views as of Friday afternoon. It was flagged by the social media platform, which provided additional context that the video had been cropped. The unedited footage shows a different picture: a skydiver had just landed in the spot Biden walked toward moments before and the president went to approach him to give him a thumbs up. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni then brought Biden back to the group so one of the skydivers could brief them. Another angle of the moment shows the skydiver Biden was addressing when he walked away. White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, in a post to X, said the \"Murdoch outlets are so desperate to distract from\" Biden's record that \"they just lie.\" \"Here, they use an artificially narrow frame to hide from viewers that he just saw a skydiving demonstration,\" Bates wrote. \"He's saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs-up.\" Bates also posted his own video that showed Biden walking toward the skydiver to praise him.  Polls show age is a major issue among voters this election cycle when it came to both candidates, though more appear to have concerns about Biden, who turned 81 last year. A recent Marquette University poll found 79% of respondents said the phrase \"too old\" describes Biden \"very or somewhat well,\" compared to 54% who said the same about Trump.

But the record-high prices the world is seeing for OJ right now may be on the table for a while, since the diseases and extreme weather ravaging orange groves in some top-producing countries aren\u2019t easily resolved problems. This year\u2019s harvest in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest exporter of orange juice, is likely to be the worst in 36 years due to flooding and drought, according to a forecast by Fundecitrus, a citrus growers\u2019 organization in Sao Paulo state. \u201cThe concern isn't just that the price of juice is going up. The concern is not having the juice,\u201d Oscar Simonetti, an orange farmer in Mogi Guacu, Brazil, said. In the U.S., Florida's already diminished orange production fell 62% in the 2022-2023 season after Hurricane Ian further battered a crop that was struggling due to an invasive pest. Drought also cut Spain\u2019s orange production last year. Scarce supplies have sent prices soaring. In the U.S., a 12-ounce can of frozen orange juice concentrate cost an average of $4.27 in April, 42% more than during the same month a year earlier, according to government figures.  In the United Kingdom, where the British Fruit Juice Association says supplies are at 50-year lows, the price of fresh orange juice rose 25% over the past year, according to consumer research company Nielsen. Those price increases are turning off inflation-weary consumers. Orange juice consumption has fallen 15% to 25% in major global markets \u2014 including the U.S. and the European Union \u2014 over the last year, according to Rabobank, a Dutch bank that focuses on food and agriculture. Jonna Parker, a principal for fresh food client insights at market research company Circana, said consumers are increasingly getting their morning fruit intake from energy drinks, smoothies and other beverages besides orange juice. \u201cThe price gets high and people consider other alternatives,\u201d she said. Global orange juice consumption was already declining before the current price hikes due to competition from other drinks and public concern about the amount of sugar in fruit juices. If that trend continues, it should help balance supply with demand and keep prices from rising much further, Rabobank said. But it expects limited supplies will keep prices elevated for some time. In some markets, orange juice is disappearing from shelves altogether. Late last year, McDonald\u2019s in Australia removed orange juice from its menu in favor of an \u201corange fruit drink\u201d that contains 35% orange juice. The company cited short supplies.  Tokyo-based Morinaga Milk Industry Co. expects to stop shipping its Sunkist brand orange juice \u2013 which uses juice from Brazil \u2013 by the end of June because of low juice supplies from Brazil, a company spokeswoman said. In April 2023, Megmilk Snow Brand Co., based in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, stopped shipments of 1-liter (about a quart) and 450-milliliter (15.2-ounce) packs of orange juice, which it sells under an agreement with Dole. Sales haven\u2019t yet resumed. Some companies are considering using alternatives to oranges in their products. Coldpress, a British juice company, introduced a mandarin juice product in February, citing the high price of regular juicing oranges.  But others are tight-lipped about their plans. Several major orange juice makers \u2013 including Dole, Tropicana, Florida\u2019s Natural, Uncle Matt\u2019s and Coca-Cola, which makes the Simply and Minute Maid brands \u2013 declined to comment or failed to respond to inquires from The Associated Press. The roots of the current supply troubles stretch back decades. In 2005, an invasive bug called the Asian citrus psyllid arrived in Florida, injecting bacteria from its saliva into the state\u2019s orange trees. The bacteria slowly kills the tree by destroying its root systems. There\u2019s no known cure once a tree is infected. The impact has been devastating. In 2004, before the disease \u2013 called citrus greening \u2013 hit Florida, the state produced 200 million boxes of oranges. This year, it will produce less than 20 million. Michael Rogers, a professor of entomology and the director of the University of Florida\u2019s Citrus Research and Education Center, said no type of orange tree is totally resistant to greening, but scientists have been trying to breed trees that are more tolerant of it. Citrus greening arrived in Brazil around the same time as Florida, but it has progressed more slowly there because Brazil has much larger orange groves. Bugs spread the disease by flying from tree to tree, Rogers said. Still, the disease is spreading. Fundecitrus estimates that 38% of Brazil\u2019s orange trees had citrus greening in 2023. Simonetti, the orange farmer, estimates that 20% of his production is affected by greening. Oranges on affected trees don't ripen properly and fall off early, affecting the quality of their juice, he said. Shifting production to other locations isn\u2019t necessarily an option. California grows oranges, for example, and the citrus psyllid doesn\u2019t fare as well in the state\u2019s climate. But California also doesn\u2019t get the rainfall needed for juicing oranges; its oranges are usually sold for eating, Rogers said. Another issue impacting orange harvests is extreme weather, which is becoming more common as the world warms due to climate change. Last year, nine heat waves swept across Brazil, resulting in lower output and poorer fruit quality. This year, the impacts of El Ni\u00f1o have been particularly dramatic, with a historic drought in the Amazon and devastating floods in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul. \u201cThe temperatures are high during the day. At night the temperature drops. The plant can't stand this temperature difference,\u201d Simonetti said.  Brazil\u2019s 2024-2025 harvest is expected to yield 232 million boxes of oranges, down 24% from the prior year. \u201cWe have never seen a harvest like this,\u201d Vin\u00edcius Trombin, the coordinator of Fundecitrus\u2019 crop estimates survey, said. To make up for the anticipated smaller yield, some producers are considering blending oranges with tangerines to make juice, Trombin said. But he\u2019s skeptical. \u201cThe consumer wants an orange juice made up 100% out of oranges,\u201d he said. Parker, of Circana, isn\u2019t so sure. She thinks blends with other fruits might help hold down costs and revive consumer interest in orange juice. \u201cThe idea of multiple flavors is very popular and is a way to stand out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep people engaged. Once you lose that interest, it\u2019s really hard to get people back.\u201d ___ Durbin reported from Detroit.

O\u2019Brien noted that the pope \u201cspoke in Italian, so I\u2019m not quite sure what was said.\u201d \u201cTo be in that room and to be with all my fellow comedians, some of whom I\u2019ve been good friends with for many years, in that environment, was quite strange,\" the TV host added. \"All of us were thinking, how did this happen? Why are we here, and when are they going to throw us out?\u201d Colbert admitted his Italian \u201cis really bad, I would like to speak it better.\u201d But he managed to remind the pope that he had done the audiobook for his memoir. \u201cIt was wonderful, he\u2019ll never forget me,\u201d he joked. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Devin Dwyer","title":"Supreme Court unanimously strikes down legal challenge to abortion pill mifepristone","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/supreme-court-unanimously-strikes-legal-challenge-abortion-pill\/story?id=110439079","description":"The Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a legal challenge the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of the abortion pill mifepristone.","date":"2024-06-13T14:07:03Z","content":"The ruling preserves access to the mail-order medication nationwide. The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled a group of doctors lacked legal standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of the abortion pill mifepristone, preserving access to the medication nationwide. The unanimous opinion was authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The case put abortion access back in the spotlight for the court for the first time since its conservative majority voted to overrule Roe v. Wade in 2022.  \"Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others,\" Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. \"Because plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, plaintiffs are unregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA's regulation of others.\" \"Plaintiffs advance several complicated causation theories to connect FDA's actions to the plaintiffs' alleged injuries in fact,\" Kavanaugh added. \"None of these theories suffices to establish Article III standing.\" Mifepristone is the first pill taken in a two-drug regimen for medication abortion, which is the most common method of abortion in the country. The court's ruling means mifepristone will remain available under preexisting conditions, which include allowing women to receive the medication by mail and without any in person dispensation requirement. But the Supreme Court did not address the doctors' claims the FDA erred in those regulations, which were enacted in 2016 and 2021. Instead, it leaves those questions to be resolved another time. Already, similar challenges against mifepristone are being brought by three Republican-led states: Missouri, Kansas and Idaho. Their attorneys claim they will fare better on legal standing.  Justice Kavanaugh suggested that while the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine \"failed to demonstrate that FDA's relaxed regulatory requirements likely would cause them to suffer an injury,\" there was another avenue for challenging the abortion pill. \"The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in the regulatory process,\" he wrote. Drug maker Danco, which fought to defend the pill, said the ruling was a huge win for the pharmaceutical industry which had warned against courts overriding the judgment of scientists and experts at FDA. The court \"maintained the stability of the FDA drug approval process, which is based on the agency's expertise and on which patients, healthcare providers and the US pharmaceutical industry rely,\" a Danco spokeswoman Abigail Long, said in a statement. Abortion opponents decried the decision as \"deeply disappointing.\" \"It is a sad day for all who value women's health and unborn children's lives, but the fight to stop dangerous mail-order abortion drugs is not over,\" said Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America policy director Katie Daniel. Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley, who argued before the court on behalf of the doctors, also expressed dismay that the justices did not dive into the merits of the case. Hawley said the group \"will continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs.\"  The Supreme Court did deliver a forceful endorsement of conscience protections for doctors who oppose abortion -- perhaps a sign of how it might rule in another major abortion case this term: Moyle v. U.S. That case focuses on Idaho's abortion ban and whether a federal law governing emergency care protects access to abortion at hospitals when a woman's health is at risk. The court appeared fractured on the issue when it heard arguments on April 24. A decision is expected by the end of June. \"Federal conscience laws definitively protect doctors from being required to perform abortions or to provide other treatment that violates their consciences,\" Kavanaugh wrote in Thursday's opinion. President Joe Biden said the court's mifepristone decision \"does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues.\" \"Women are being turned away from emergency rooms, or forced to go to court to plead for care that their doctor recommended or to travel hundreds of miles for care,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Doctors and nurses are being threatened with jail time, including life in prison, for providing the health care they have been trained to provide. And contraception and IVF are under attack.\" 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Selina Wang","title":"G7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine $50 billion using frozen Russian assets","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/g7-leaders-agree-lend-ukraine-50-billion-frozen\/story?id=111090880","description":"The money would come from interest accrued on some $300 billion.","date":"2024-06-13T13:54:21Z","content":"The money would come from interest accrued on some $300 billion. G7 leaders on Thursday agreed to lend Ukraine $50 billion this year -- backed by profits from frozen Russian assets -- to help the country's war effort and rebuilding. This plan has been years in the making. It's a win for President Biden, who has been pushing allies to agree to the deal, amid hesitation from some European countries. The agreement will be formalized in the communique at the end of the summit. But there are still key details of the plan the countries need to work out. The US is willing to make a loan of up to $50 billion, though it's unclear exactly how much the U.S. will end up lending. Other counties will pitch in to share the risk. \"We're going to move with urgency,\" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.  \"Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond and this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap\u2026 This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world, that we're not going to fatigue and defending Ukraine's freedom and that Putin is not going to outlast us.\" Officials said that while it will take time for the funds to be disbursed, they do expect the money to begin to be disbursed this calendar year. Funds will be used for military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support. When asked by reporters about the risks associated with the loans, the senior administration official said that it can be thought of as a\"secured loan\" because of the interest that is generated from the Russian assets. The official added that there are scenarios in which the income stream \"may not flow,\" but noted that reparations could be a solution. \"How are we going to get repaid? Russia pays\u2026the income comes from the interest stream on the immobilized asset,\" the official said. \"The principal is untouched for now, but we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there.\" The official added that \"if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized. And keep generating interest to repay the loans or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment.\" When I asked how the U.S. overcame pushback from some allies, the official said that the risks of this agreement outweighed the risk of Ukraine falling short on funding to counter Russia's offensive. \"What's the alternative? And if Ukraine was insufficiently financed, to win this war, what would be the chilling effect it would cause across Europe and the rest of the world? What would be the signal to autocrats that they can redraw borders by force? Those are the costs, I think we all agreed were unacceptable, and that's why we acted,\" the administration official said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Marilyn Heck, Kevin Shalvey","title":"Cal State Los Angeles protesters enter Student Services building","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/cal-state-los-angeles-protesters-enter-student-services\/story?id=111081600","description":"CSULA protesters entered a campus building on Wednesday, taking over the first floor and \"a small number\" of administrators were still in the building, officials said.","date":"2024-06-13T06:15:06Z","content":"A \"small number\" of administrators were in the building, an official said.

Biden, in during a press conference in Italy with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the collective efforts by the G7 show that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"cannot wait us out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail this war.\"\u00a0 On the bilateral agreement, Biden said the goal is to \"strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term.\" He reiterated his position that American troops will not fight in Ukraine, but the United States would provide them with weapons. Zelenskyy called it a \"historic day\" after signing the \"strongest agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. since our independence.\" \"This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation, and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace. And therefore, it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global threat,\"\u00a0Zelenskyy said.\u00a0 Zelenskyy was asked what his contingency plan is if the next U.S. president does not follow through with this agreement, but he suggested that as long as Americans support Ukraine, so will the American president.\u00a0 \"If the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom,\" he said.  Highlighting the frozen Russian assets, Biden said the plan that's been agreed to by the G7 is another reminder for Putin that \"we\u2019re not backing down.\" \"Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions and will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success,\" Biden said. After Biden recently signed off on Ukraine using American weapons to strike in parts of Russia, limiting use to areas near the Russian-occupied Kharkiv region, he was asked if he would consider expanding those parameters to allow for longer-range strikes; he said his policy is still against that.  \"It makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border. In terms of long, long-range weapons, longer-range weapons into the interior of Russia, we have not changed our position on that sort,\" he said. Zelenskyy was asked about how long the supplemental support from the U.S. and other nations will get him on the battlefield. He said it's not a matter of how long the aid lasts, but, more importantly, how long unity among nations will last.\u00a0 \"I think the question has to be, for how long the unity will last? The unity in the United States, together with the European leaders -- how these or those elections will influence this unity?\" Zelensky said, via translation \"It seems to me that we should look on this exactly this way: to preserve unity, to preserve the integrity of the world, the integrity of the democratic world. Because if Ukraine does not withstand, the democracy, many countries will not be able to withstand, and I am sure of that,\" he added.

Firearms are the leading cause of death in the United States for children aged 0-19 years, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting over 4,700 pediatric gun-related deaths in 2021. Many of those deaths are unintentional. A new study published by the CDC described how often guns are stored in different U.S. states. Up to 43% of households store loaded guns, which is not considered safe, while half of the households that store guns loaded with ammunition do not put them in locked containers, according to the study. Loaded guns that are not locked can be easy for children to find and accidentally fire. Households from eight states were surveyed for this high-quality report; including Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma. The percentage of households who had guns and stored guns securely varied widely between states. North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Nevada had the highest rates of households storing loaded guns, the report said. Pediatricians and advocates say one simple strategy could dramatically reduce the number of children who are killed: Secure firearm storage. This means storing a firearm locked, unloaded and with the ammunition stored separately from the firearm. Though it sounds simple, there are a range of options for storing your gun securely at home.  Options include cable locks, lock boxes, trigger locks and gun safes. Most can be found for purchase on large retail websites, such as Amazon, or through stores like The Home Depot or Dick's Sporting Goods. \"It really comes down to what does the family want or need,\" Dr. Sandra McKay, an associate professor of pediatrics at UTHealth Houston and nonresident fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, told ABC News. The bottom line is too many children are in harm's way, according to McKay. This sentiment was also shared by Dr. Eric Sigel, a pediatrician, adolescent medicine specialist, and co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Firearm Injury Prevention Special Interest Group who highlighted a recent study estimating that 1 in 3 middle and high schoolers have access to a firearm. Through statistical modeling, another study calculated that if 20% of parents changed their current storage practices to storing firearms unloaded and with the ammunition locked away separately \"there would be an estimated decrease of up to 122 pediatric firearm-related fatalities and 201 injuries annually.\" Four common types of secure storage devices include: Like a bike lock, but for a firearm. A cable lock is a flexible cable that loops through an empty firearm, making it impossible to load or fire. These range in price from $5-50 and are oftentimes available for free through both local and national community organizations. Smaller, portable versions of a gun safe. A lock box is made of metal or durable plastic. It has a lock on it to keep it shut. They are perfect for storing a single gun to make sure it's secure but available for quick access. They cost between $25-$350. Trigger locks fit over the trigger mechanism of a firearm to keep it from being pulled. They are small and compatible with most firearms, but not as safe as other options because a firearm can still be loaded with a trigger lock in place. And, if not put on correctly, a loaded firearm may accidentally fire. These cost between $10-$50. Large, heavy safes that can store multiple guns, including rifles and shotguns. Made of tough metal, they have electronic or mechanical locks. Gun safes are one of the most secure places to store guns, but they are also the most expensive starting at $500. \"There are a lot of different places that families can go to learn about these various devices. I think one of the secret gems out there are going to your [Gun] Range Safety Officers,\" said McKay. Other resources include Hunter Safety Training, gun shops, and local law enforcement agencies. Outside of the home, McKay and Sigel encourage parents to discuss secure firearm storage with healthcare providers, family members, friends, and neighbors. McKay recommends using neutral language that emphasizes child safety, similar to how one would address food allergies, pool access and pets.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected what he called an ultimatum by Putin to surrender more territory. Putin\u2019s remarks came as Switzerland prepared to host scores of world leaders -- but not from Moscow -- this weekend to try to map out first steps toward peace in Ukraine. They also coincided with a meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Italy and after the U.S. and Ukraine this week signed a 10-year security agreement that Russian officials, including Putin, denounced as \u201cnull and void.\u201d Putin blasted the Switzerland conference as \u201cjust another ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention, reverse the cause and effect of the Ukrainian crisis (and) set the discussion on the wrong track.\u201d His demands came in a speech at the Russian Foreign Ministry and was aimed at what he called a \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the conflict rather than \u201cfreezing it,\u201d and stressed the Kremlin is \u201cready to start negotiations without delay.\u201d Broader demands for peace that Putin listed included Ukraine\u2019s recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, keeping the country\u2019s nonnuclear status, restricting its military force and protecting the interests of the Russian-speaking population. All of these should be part of \u201cfundamental international agreements,\u201d and all Western sanctions against Russia should be lifted, Putin said. \u201cWe\u2019re urging to turn this tragic page of history and to begin restoring, step-by-step, the unity between Russia and Ukraine and in Europe in general,\u201d he said. Putin\u2019s remarks, made to a group of somber Foreign Ministry officials and some senior lawmakers, represented a rare occasion in which he clearly laid out his conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, but it didn\u2019t include any new demands. The Kremlin has said before that Kyiv should recognize its territorial gains and drop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in Italy for the G7 meeting, said Putin's proposal was not new and was in the form of an \u201cultimatum,\u201d comparing it to actions by Adolf Hitler in seizing territory that led to World War II. \u201cWhat Putin demands is to give them a part of our territories, those occupied and not occupied, talking about several regions of our country,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry called Putin\u2019s plan \u201cmanipulative,\u201d \u201cabsurd\u201d and designed to \u201cmislead the international community, undermine diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a just peace, and split the unity of the world majority around the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.\u201d Besides seeking to join NATO, Ukraine wants Russian forces out of its territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was illegally annexed in 2014; the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity; and that Russia be held accountable for war crimes and for Moscow to pay reparations to Kyiv. Russia launched its a full-scale invasion in February 2022. After Ukrainian forces thwarted a Russian drive to the capital, much of the fighting has focused in the south and east, where Moscow illegally annexed four regions, although it doesn\u2019t fully control any of them. Zelenskyy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on social media there was nothing new from Putin and that the Russian leader \u201cvoiced only the \u2018standard aggressor\u2019s set,\u2019 which has been heard many times already.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak wrote on X. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels that Putin \u201chas illegally occupied sovereign Ukrainian territory. He is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about a peace.\u201d Austin added that Putin \u201cstarted this war with no provocation. He could end it today if he chose to do that.\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg added that \u201cthis is not a peace proposal. This is a proposal of more aggression, more occupation, and it demonstrates in a way that that Russia\u2019s aim is to control Ukraine.\u201d Putin insisted that Kyiv should withdraw from all four annexed regions entirely and essentially cede them to Moscow within their administrative borders. In Zaporizhzhia in the southeast, Russia still doesn\u2019t control the region\u2019s administrative capital with a pre-war population of about 700,000; in the neighboring Kherson region, Moscow withdrew from its biggest city and capital of the same name in November 2022. Putin said if \u201cKyiv and Western capitals\u201d reject his offer, \u201cit is their business, their political and moral responsibility for continuing the bloodshed.\u201d The Kremlin has repeatedly aired its readiness for peace talks with Kyiv and blamed the West for undermining its efforts to end the conflict. Putin went further Friday and claimed his troops never intended to storm Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, even though they approached the city. \u201cIn essence, it was nothing other than an operation to force the Ukrainian regime to peace. The troops were there to push the Ukrainian side to negotiate, to try and find an acceptable solution,\u201d he said. Moscow withdrew from Kyiv in March 2022 and described it a goodwill gesture as peace talks between the two began, but the pullback took place amid fierce Ukrainian resistance that significantly slowed down Russia\u2019s battlefield advances. Putin also claimed that in that same month, he told a foreign official he wasn\u2019t ruling out withdrawing forces from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and ceding occupied parts of them back to Ukraine, as long as Kyiv allowed Russia to have a \u201cstrong land connection\u201d to Crimea. He said the official planned on bringing that proposal to Kyiv \u2014 which Moscow \u201cwelcomed,\u201d as it generally welcomed \u201cattempts to find a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\u201d But the Kremlin then annexed both regions, along with the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, citing the results of sham \u201creferendums\u201d it staged there. Putin mentioned those and said, \u201cThe matter is closed forever and is no longer up for discussion.\u201d In Friday\u2019s fighting, Russian defenses shot down 87 Ukrainian drones, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said, most of them launched against the Rostov region, home to Russia\u2019s southern military command, but no deaths or damage were reported in one of the biggest Ukrainian drone barrages of the war. In Russia\u2019s Belgorod region on the border, part of a residential building collapsed in the town of Shebekino after Ukrainian shelling, Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Three people were injured, he said. Ukraine\u2019s military has been on the back foot in recent months, with its troops outnumbered by the Kremlin\u2019s forces and running short of ammunition and weaponry due to delays in promised Western military aid. Russia has battered Ukraine with drones, especially its power grid. It fired 14 missiles and 17 Shahed drones overnight, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Air defense systems downed all the drones as well as seven missiles, it said. The attacks injured six people in the Donetsk region, where residential buildings were hit, officials said. A Russian drone struck a bus near the village of Esman in the northern Sumy region, injuring three women. Authorities say 20 passengers were in the bus at the time. Also Friday, Russia returned to Ukraine the bodies of 254 of its soldiers, Kyiv said.

Former President Donald Trump's comments reportedly calling Milwaukee a \"horrible city\" continue to spark debate as Republicans and Trump's campaign dispute the characterization of his comments, and Democrats persistently amplify his words -- including through a new billboard campaign in the city. \ufeffIn his closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Thursday, Trump called Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National Convention next month, a \"horrible city,\" sources told ABC News. The comments, first reported by Punchbowl News, attacked Milwaukee -- a major city in a key battleground state in the 2024 election where both Trump and President Joe Biden are working to woo voters.  Trump clarified his comments in an interview with WITI-TV, the Milwaukee Fox News station, on Thursday. \"It was very clear what I meant. I said, we're very concerned with crime,\" Trump said. \"I love Milwaukee, I have great friends in Milwaukee. The crime numbers are terrible and we have to be very careful.\" Trump's campaign spokesperson also punched back on the reports, arguing that Trump's words were taken out of context. \"He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are,\" said campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung. In another statement, the campaign wrote that it was a \"total lie\" that Trump called Milwaukee a \"horrible city.\" However, they went on to add, \"President Trump was explicitly referring to the problems in Milwaukee, specifically violent crime and voter fraud,\" suggesting he did make comments about the city, just not in the way some were interpreting it. The campaign then includes a series of tweets from Republican members from Wisconsin inside the room who agree with the campaign's description that Trump was not making a blanket disparaging statement about the city. Republicans -- including those from Wisconsin -- quickly jumped to Trump's defense, insisting the former president was talking about crime and election security. \"@realdonaldtrump was specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden posted on X after the meeting. Rep. Glenn Grothman told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Trump \"was concerned about the election\" and \"felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.\" Rep. Bryan Steil claimed on X that Trump \"did not say this\" in the conference meeting. \"There is no better place than Wisconsin in July,\" Steil said.  The front page of Friday's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel featured Trump's words front and center: \"Trump: Milwaukee 'horrible.'\" Biden's campaign and other Democrats are also teeing off on Trump's comments. Biden's campaign is starting to sell merchandise, including stickers and T-shirts that read \"(NOT) a horrible city\" on top of the Wisconsin state outline as well as \"I love Milwaukee\" T-shirts where the heart is replaced with beer, an homage to the many breweries around the state. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced that the group has paid to put up billboards around Milwaukee with Trump's reported comments criticizing the city. The billboards, which will launch in 10 different locations across the city, feature the quote that Trump is reported to have said during Thursday's closed-door House Republican meeting: \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\" In a post on X, Biden responded to Trump's comments with a photo of him with the Milwaukee Bucks after they won the 2021 NBA Championship. \"I happen to love Milwaukee.\" Trump's rivals are accusing him of abandoning the pivotal swing state -- including Wisconsin's Democrats. \"If Donald Trump thinks Milwaukee is so horrible, then he shouldn't come to our city,\" Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign Manager Garren Randolph said in a statement. \"Milwaukee -- our state's largest and most diverse city and home to more than 577,000 people, the Bucks and Brewers, and the country's best beer -- deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values.\" Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign event in Racine, Wisconsin -- 30 miles south of Milwaukee -- next Tuesday, where he will focus his remarks on inflation and immigration. In just over a month, Trump will return to Milwaukee to accept the Republican nomination at the party's convention. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"US cricket team advances to second round in Twenty20 World Cup debut","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Sports\/wireStory\/us-cricket-team-advances-round-twenty20-world-cup-111135764","description":"The United States cricket team has made more history by qualifying for the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out in Florida","date":"2024-06-14T19:18:26Z","content":"The United States cricket team has made more history by qualifying for the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out in Florida LAUDERHILL, Fla. -- The United States cricket team made more history by reaching the second round in its Twenty20 World Cup debut after its last group game against Ireland was washed out on Friday. Rain meant the match at Broward County Stadium was abandoned without a ball bowled, advancing the Americans to the Super Eight stage and automatically qualifying them for the 2026 Twenty20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. South Africa beat Nepal by one run and New Zealand defeated Uganda by nine wickets in later matches Friday. The U.S. qualified for this T20 World Cup only as a co-host with the West Indies, but it has used home advantage to make a stunning first impression in its first major cricket tournament. While the Americans progressed alongside unbeaten India from Group A, former champion Pakistan and winless Ireland were eliminated from Super Eight contention. Pakistan won the title in 2009 and reached two more finals, including at the last T20 World Cup in 2022. Pakistan has failed to get out of the group stage for the first time. Ireland was expected to be a threat, too. The Irish also reached the second round on debut in 2009 and repeated in 2022. The competition point from the washout was enough for the U.S. to advance after beating Canada in Texas and stunning Pakistan in Texas during the first week. Tying Pakistan in regular overs then beating it in a super over was one of the greatest upsets in the tournament's history. The Americans were thumped by India, one of the title favorites, as expected on Wednesday but the hosts' progression without being able to play on Friday was still well deserved. The umpires made four inspections of the wet outfield before heavy rain arrived at around 1:30 p.m. local time and the match was called off three hours after its scheduled start. The 17th-ranked U.S. joined the West Indies, India, Australia, South Africa and Afghanistan in the Super Eight, with two more teams yet to qualify.  Nepal has come within a whisker of achieving its best-ever win in cricket, losing by one run to powerhouse South Africa at Kingstown, St. Vincent in the Caribbean. Nepal needed two runs from the last ball of the match to win, one run to match South Africa\u2019s modest total of 115-7 and force a Super Over. But teenager Ghulsan Jha was run out at the non-striker\u2019s end attempting a single from the final ball and South Africa held on to win a thrilling match. The Nepal players were disconsolate. They seemed to be headed for Nepal\u2019s first win in 12 attempts against a ICC full member nation when they needed 22 runs from the last 24 balls. They needed 18 runs from 18 balls but lost three wickets for one run within six balls including two wickets to Tabraiz Shamsi and the equation changed. Gulshan was unable to score from the first two balls of the last over, bowled by Ottneil Baartman. He then slashed a four through the off side and Nepal needed four runs from three balls. Gulshan ran two with Sompal Kami and Nepal needed 2 from two balls. The fifth ball was a dot ball \u2014 no runs were scored \u2014 and Gulshan was run out next ball to end the match. \u201cWe were very close and yet so far,\u201d Nepal captain Rohit Paudel said. \u201cI think in crunch moments we did well and the way we fought was very good. If we can play top teams more regularly then next time we will be on the winning side.\" Tim Southee took three wickets for four runs as New Zealand achieved its first win in Group C, bowling out Uganda for 40 in 18.2 overs and reaching that target with nine wickets to spare. Southee and his long-time bowling partner Trent Boult who took two wickets for seven runs, and Rachin Ravindra with 2-9 combined to bowl out Uganda for the third lowest total at a T20 World Cup. Uganda was bowled out for 39 by the West Indies earlier in the tournament and shares that record with the Netherlands who made 39 against Sri Lanka in 2014. New Zealand had no chance of reaching the Super Eight stage after losing its first two matches to Afghanistan and the West Indies. Those two teams have secured the Super Eight qualifying spots from Group C. \u201cIt was obviously a pretty clinical performance and nice to get a win,\u201d Southee said. \u201cWe're extremely disappointed to have played ourselves out of the tournament.\u201d ___ AP cricket: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/cricket 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"JENNIFER PELTZ Associated Press","title":"Dogs' digs at the Garden: Westminster show returning to Madison Square Garden next year","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/wireStory\/dogs-digs-garden-westminster-show-returning-madison-square-111139190","description":"Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs","date":"2024-06-14T22:04:38Z","content":"Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs NEW YORK -- Madison Square Garden is going back to the dogs. The Westminster Kennel Club announced this week that its storied dog show is returning next year to the Manhattan arena for the first time since 2020. That year's show was held weeks before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and shutdowns began in New York City and across the United States. For various reasons, the annual canine contest has since been held at an estate in suburban Westchester and at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. But organizers have wanted to return to Manhattan and to the so-called World's Most Famous Arena, the dog show's home for nearly all of the event's 148 years.  The 2025 show will begin with an agility competition Feb. 8 at the sprawling Javits Center convention venue, a few blocks from Madison Square Garden. The traditional breed-by-breed contest that leads to the best in show trophy will unfold on Feb. 10 and 11, with preliminary-round judging at the Javits Center during daytime hours and the semifinals and finals at night at the Garden.  \u201cAs Westminster approaches its 150th anniversary in 2026, we could not be more excited to welcome our celebration of the world\u2019s top canines, as well as our incredible fan base, back to this global stage,\u201d club President Donald Sturz said in a statement. About 3,000 canines compete in the various events at Westminster, which is considered the most prestigious U.S. dog show.  This year's winner was a miniature poodle named Sage, while a border collie-papillion mix called Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial.  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"DAVID KOENIG AP airlines writer","title":"A Southwest Airlines plane that did a 'Dutch roll' suffered structural damage, investigators say","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/wireStory\/southwest-airlines-plane-dutch-roll-suffered-structural-damage-111139753","description":"Investigators say a Southwest Airlines plane suffered damage to parts of the structure after it went into a \u201cDutch roll\u201d during a flight last month","date":"2024-06-14T22:22:15Z","content":"Investigators say a Southwest Airlines plane suffered damage to parts of the structure after it went into a \u201cDutch roll\u201d during a flight last month A Boeing 737 Max suffered damage to parts of the plane's structure after it went into a \u201cDutch roll\u201d during a Southwest Airlines flight last month, U.S. investigators said Friday.  The incident happened as the jet cruised at 34,000 feet from Phoenix to Oakland, California, on May 25, but Southwest did not notify the National Transportation Safety Board about the roll or damage to the jetliner until June 7, the NTSB said. \u201cFollowing the event, SWA performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components,\u201d the safety board said. The NTSB comment could suggest that the incident was more serious than previously known, but aviation experts said it was too soon to know for sure. A Southwest spokesperson said the Dallas-based airline is participating in the investigation. He declined further comment. A Dutch roll is a combination of yaw, or the tail sliding side to side, and the plane rocking in a way that causes the wings to roll up and down. The name comes from the way the rhythmic, swaying movement resembles a form of ice skating that was popular in the Netherlands. \u201cIt's just a part of aerodynamics,\u201d said John Cox, a former airline pilot and now an aviation-safety consultant. \u201cWhat you feel in the back is that the airplane sort of wallows.\u201d Pilots train to recover from a Dutch roll, and most modern planes include a device called a yaw damper that can correct the condition by adjusting the rudder. A preliminary report by the Federal Aviation Administration said that after the Southwest plane landed, damage was discovered to a unit that controls backup power to the rudder. The damage was described as \u201csubstantial.\u201d Cox said the structural damage likely occurred in the plane's tail fin, where the power units are housed. He was baffled that the backup unit would be damaged because normally it would not be activated during a Dutch roll.  Cox said the two-way oscillation of a Dutch roll was a dangerous phenomenon in previous Boeing jets, but not in 737s because of design changes. Boeing \u201c737s are not prone to excessive Dutch roll. The design of the airplane is (such that) if you do absolutely nothing, the airplane will dampen the Dutch roll out naturally,\u201d he said. \u201cIn older-model airplanes \u2014 707s, 727s \u2014 it could develop up to the point you could lose control of the airplane.\u201d The NTSB said it downloaded data from the plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, which will help investigators determine the length and severity of the incident. Investigators won't know precisely what the pilots were saying, however: The cockpit voice recorder was overwritten after two hours.  The pilots regained control and landed at Oakland. There were no reported injuries on the flight, which carried 175 passengers and a crew of six.  The NTSB said it expected to issue a preliminary report on the incident in about 30 days.  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Lalee Ibssa, Soo Rin Kim, Kelsey Walsh","title":"Trump turns 78, a day he'd like to pretend 'doesn't exist,' in age-focused election","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-turns-78-birthday-hed-pretend-doesnt-exist\/story?id=111123900","description":"Not all birthdays are worth celebrating in the eyes of former President Donald Trump, who marks his 78th birthday on Friday.","date":"2024-06-14T18:13:04Z","content":"Trump is not missing out on the chance to campaign on his birthday. Not all birthdays are worth celebrating in the eyes of former President Donald Trump, who marks his 78th birthday on Friday. \"There's a certain point at which you don't want to hear 'Happy Birthday.' You just want to pretend the day doesn't exist,\" Trump quipped to his supporters last week at a rally in Las Vegas after they broke out in song for him ahead of his birthday. Still, the former president is not missing out on the chance to campaign on his birthday -- marking his 78th with a sold-out speech in West Palm Beach Friday evening in front of his most fervent supporters: members of his \"Club 47\" fan group. On Thursday, Trump also received an early birthday celebration from congressional Republicans, who sang for him during their closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, sources told ABC News. They presented him with a cake with the numbers \"45\" and \"47\" as they rallied behind him in a show of force ahead of November's election.  However, in an election year where age remains a focal points for both candidates, Trump has attempted to highlight mental fitness and competency instead of age as he edges closer to the age of his opponent, President Joe Biden. \"Joe Biden is not too old to be president. I know a lot of people that are older than me. They're at the top of their game. It's not even close. But he is too incompetent,\" Trump said in a video posted on his social media platform last week. Trump repeated his claim that Biden is incompetent -- not old -- during his most recent rally in Las Vegas, even questioning the sitting president's intelligence. \"This guy -- there's just something missing,\" Trump said. \"There always has been -- by the way, he always had the worst and dumbest foreign policy.\" Trump was able to fend off his younger Republican challengers during the primary as they launched attacks on his age, calling for a new generation of leadership. \"I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible? I really do,\" Trump said at a rally in January, responding to criticisms from former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley about his age. \"Now Biden can't say that, you know he can't say that.\" Trump said something similar at a New Hampshire rally in January. \"I feel like I'm about 35 years old. I actually feel better now than they did 30 years ago. Tell me, is that crazy?\" Trump said. \"I feel better now. And I think cognitively I'm better than I was 20 years ago. I don't know why.\" He has also routinely bragged about \"acing\" the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, a test doctors use to uncover early signs of cognitive impairment, while in the White House. \"Only about 2% in this room can do it, but I did it. I did it very easily,\" Trump said about his results on the test at an event in Las Vegas in January. \"But I got mocked -- they said, 'Oh, that's so easy.' It's not easy. It's not easy. Go home and try doing it.\"  The Trump campaign has started fundraising off the former president's birthday, blasting out numerous fundraising emails to followers, asking them to sign his virtual birthday card and a donation in celebration of his birthday. \"Birthdays are incredibly important in our family, and we're counting on your help to make President Trump's birthday celebration his BIGGEST one yet! Our goal is to collect 1 MILLION signatures from Patriots like YOU wishing him a 'happy birthday,' but we're missing yours,\" the email reads. The Biden campaign is using Trump's birthday to highlight his stumbles throughout his professional and political life, releasing a list of \"78 of Trump's historic ... 'accomplishments,'\" which include his felony convictions as well as digs at his business ventures into steak, vodka and water. \"Happy birthday, Donald. You're a crook, a failure, a fraud, and a threat to our democracy, economy, rights, and future,\" Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. \"On behalf of America, our early gift for your 79th: Making sure you are never President again.\" Biden has repeatedly been forced to defend his mental fitness and age due to persistent gaffes; however, his campaign has leaned into his old age, highlighting how it shows he has extensive experience to address the nation's problems. In a campaign ad released earlier this cycle, Biden acknowledged his advanced age directly. \"Look, I'm not a young guy,\" Biden said with a chuckle at the start of the ad, speaking directly to camera. \"That's no secret. Here's the deal, I understand how to get things done for the American people.\"  On Biden's 81st birthday in November, the Trump campaign released a limited, generic physical exam from Trump's doctor. \"It is my opinion that President Trump is currently in excellent health, and with his continued interest in preventative health monitoring and maintenance, he will continue to enjoy a healthy active lifestyle for years to come,\" Dr. Bruce Aronwald wrote in the letter. Trump's physician added Trump's physical exams were \"well within the normal range\" and his cognitive exams \"were exceptional.\" However, while Trump and his campaign look to highlight Biden's gaffes and blunders, the presumptive Republican nominee has had his own share of slip ups. Throughout the campaign trail, Trump has mixed up former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with Haley -- and former President Barack Obama with Biden. Both times, the campaign has attempted to clean up his comments by stating \"its a distinction with a difference.\" And as Trump often boasts about his strong mind and ability to talk off the cuff, at his most recent rally in Las Vegas, where he claimed the teleprompters weren't working because of the high heat temperatures, the former president delivered a freewheeling, tangent-filled speech. Yet still, despite the fact that polls show that voters agree that both Biden and Trump are too old to hold office for another term, they show more concern for Biden's mental fitness compared to Trump. In a Marquette University poll from last month, 79% of respondents said the phrase \"too old\" describes Biden \"very or somewhat well,\" compared to 54% saying the same of Trump. In another poll from ABC News\/IPSOS in May, people were asked which personal attributes apply to either candidate more. Trump led Biden on mental sharpness 42%-23% with 34% saying it applies to neither. On physical health, Trump again led Biden 42%-20%, with 37% applying the word to neither. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"VALERIE GONZALEZ Associated Press","title":"Mexican shelters see crowding south of the border as Biden's asylum ban takes hold","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/mexican-shelters-crowding-south-border-bidens-asylum-ban-111133413","description":"Some shelters south of the U.S. border are caring for many more migrants now that the Biden administration stopped considering most asylum requests","date":"2024-06-14T18:22:19Z","content":"Some shelters south of the U.S. border are caring for many more migrants now that the Biden administration stopped considering most asylum requests MATAMOROS, Mexico -- Some shelters south of the U.S. border are caring for many more migrants now that the Biden administration stopped considering most asylum requests, while others have yet to see much of a change. The impact appears uneven more than a week after the temporary suspension took effect. Shelters south of Texas and California have plenty of space, while as many as 500 deportations from Arizona each day are straining shelters in Mexico's Sonora state, their directors say. \u201cWe\u2019re having to turn people away because we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t have the room for all the people who need shelter,\u201d said Joanna Williams, executive director of Kino Border Initiative, which can take in 100 people at a time. About 120 are in San Juan Bosco shelter in Nogales, across the border from the Arizona city with the same name, up from about 40 before the policy change, according to its director, Juan Francisco Loureiro. \u201cWe have had a quite remarkable increase,\u201d Loureiro said Thursday. Most are Mexican, including families as well as adults. Mexico also agreed to accept deportees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. A shelter in Agua Prieta, a remote town bordering Douglas, Arizona, also began receiving more Mexican men, women and children last weekend \u2014 40 on Sunday, more than 50 on Monday and then about 30 a day. Like those sent to Nogales, most had entered the U.S. farther west, along the Arizona-California state line, according to Perla del Angel, a worker at the Exodus Migrant Attention Center. Mexicans make up a relatively large percentage of border arrests in much of Arizona compared to other regions, which may help explain why Nogales is affected. Mexicans are generally the easiest nationality to deport because officials only have to drive them to a border crossing instead of arranging a flight. In Tijuana, directors of four large shelters said this week that they haven\u2019t received a single migrant deported since the asylum ban took effect. Al Otro Lado, a migrant advocacy group, consulted only seven migrants on the first full day operating an information booth at the main crossing where migrants are deported from San Diego. \u201cWhat there is right now is a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Paulina Olvera, president of Espacio Migrante, who houses up to 40 people traveling in families, predominantly from Mexico, and has others sleeping on the sidewalk outside. \u201cSo far what we\u2019ve seen is the rumors and the mental health impact on people. We haven\u2019t seen returns yet.\u201d Biden administration officials said last week that thousands have been deported since the new rule took effect on July 5, suspending asylum whenever arrests for illegal crossings hit a trigger of 2,500 in a single day. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, were not more specific. The halt will remain in effect until arrests fall below a seven-day daily average of 1,500.  \u201cWe are ready to repatriate a record number of people in the coming days,\u201d Blas Nu\u00f1ez-Neto, assistant homeland security secretary for border and immigration policy, told Spanish-language reporters after the policy was announced.  The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for figures on Friday and neither did the National Immigration Institute in Mexico. Mexican authorities, meanwhile, have been sweeping up unauthorized people and moving them well south of the border zone. Mexican border cities have been heavily strained by earlier U.S. policy shifts, including the Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\u201d plan under which about 70,000 people waited in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Immigration advocates launched a federal challenge of the Biden administration policy change on Wednesday.  Some advocates worry that more people will languish in shelters as they try for legal entry through the CBP One app, which grants 1,450 appointments a day. Some migrants at Espacio Migrante have been trying for eight months to get an appointment on CBP One, said Olvera. Casa del Migrante in Matamoros is now operating at about half its capacity in a network of shelters across the city that together can hold up to 1,600 people. But Berta Alicia Dominguez, its director, expects a bottleneck as more migrants compete for slots through CBP One, and she's seeking help from the Catholic diocese and nongovernmental organizations. \"Food is going to be scarce for the migrants and we hope that the organizations can support us in that situation because feeding 500 people is a real feat,\u201d Dominguez said. Piedras Negras is across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, a flashpoint in Gov. Greg Abbott's battle with the Biden administration over immigration enforcement. Migration flows peaked there in December, when Casa del Migrante Frontera Digna housed as many as 1,000 migrants.  The shelter had fewer than 150 people on Thursday, but Isabel Turcios, the shelter director, worries about unintended consequences of exempting unaccompanied children from Biden's order.  \u201cWe are afraid that many mothers will come and start sending their children alone. That is a big fear we have as well,\u201d Turcios said. ___ Associated Press writers Elliot Spagat in Tijuana, Mexico, and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Judge orders liquidation of Alex Jones' personal assets to pay Sandy Hook debt, but throws out his company's bankruptcy","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/wireStory\/judge-orders-liquidation-alex-jones-personal-assets-pay-111140288","description":"Judge orders liquidation of Alex Jones' personal assets to pay Sandy Hook debt, but throws out his company's bankruptcy","date":"2024-06-14T22:44:26Z","content":"Judge orders liquidation of Alex Jones' personal assets to pay Sandy Hook debt, but throws out his company's bankruptcy HOUSTON -- Judge orders liquidation of Alex Jones' personal assets to pay Sandy Hook debt, but throws out his company's bankruptcy. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Katie Kindelan","title":"Kate Middleton shares health update amid chemotherapy for cancer","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/GMA\/Culture\/kate-middleton-shares-update-health-amid-cancer-chemotherapy\/story?id=111126385","description":"Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour will be her first with the royal family since December.","date":"2024-06-14T17:02:38Z","content":"Trooping the Colour will be Kate's first public appearance since her diagnosis. Kate, the Princess of Wales, has shared an update on her health, the first since announcing in March she had been diagnosed with cancer. Kate, 42, the wife of Prince William, said Friday that she is \"making good progress\" as she undergoes chemotherapy but is not \"out of the woods yet.\" \"I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\" Kate said in a written message shared by Kensington Palace. \"On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\" Kate said her treatment will continue \"for a few more months,\" adding, \"On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\" Kate also confirmed in her message that she will join members of the royal family on Saturday for Trooping the Colour, the military parade held annually to mark the reigning monarch's official birthday. \"I'm looking forward to attending The King's Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,\" she said. \"I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\" Kate also described herself as having been \"blown away\" by the support she has received since publicly revealing her diagnosis. \"It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times,\" she said, adding at the end of her message, \"Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.\" In addition to the health update, the palace on Friday shared a new photo of Kate, taken this week in Windsor, England, where Kate and her family live. The photograph, taken by U.K.-based photographer Matt Porteous, shows Kate, wearing a light-colored blazer and jeans, standing under a willow tree. Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour will be the first time she has been seen publicly with the royal family since December, when she attended a Christmas Day service in Sandringham. Just weeks after Christmas, in mid-January, Kate was hospitalized for what the palace described at the time as a \"planned abdominal surgery.\" After a nearly two-week hospital stay following the surgery, Kate continued to take time off from royal public duties in order to recover. In March, amid growing speculation about her health and absence from the public eye, Kate announced in a pre-recorded video message that she had been diagnosed with cancer. Speaking alone and directly to a camera, Kate described the cancer diagnosis as a \"huge shock\" for her and her family. She said the cancer was discovered in post-operative tests after her abdominal surgery in January. The type of cancer has not been disclosed. According to the palace, Kate started a course of preventative chemotherapy in late February. While Kate has remained out of the public eye during her treatment, William returned to work in mid-April. Over the course of his royal engagements, William has shared few updates on Kate, but thanked fans for their support, replying \"yes\" to a person at an event earlier in June, who asked if Kate was \"getting better.\"  William and the couple's three young  children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, will join Kate at Trooping the Colour on Saturday. The family is expected to take part in the parade and stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, per tradition, to watch the military flyover. This year's celebration will mark the second Trooping the Colour of King Charles III's reign.  Charles, 75, was also diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, but has since returned to public duties. Like Kate, Charles will also take part in this year's Trooping the Colour. He will take on a slightly modified role by riding in the parade in a horse-drawn carriage alongside his wife Queen Camilla instead of on horseback, according to Buckingham Palace. Charles' cancer was announced publicly in February. The palace has not shared what type of cancer he was diagnosed with or what type of treatment he is undergoing. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Peter Charalambous, Jessie DiMartino","title":"Will Trump go to prison for felony hush money conviction?

After becoming the first former president to face criminal charges, Donald Trump faces another historic first next month: He could become the first former president in U.S. history to be ordered to prison when he's sentenced in his New York hush money case. Several experts told ABC News that the odds are against the former president serving any time behind bars before the 2024 election, after a jury in May found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to an effort to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election. But it's possible that the nature and circumstances of Trump's alleged criminal conduct -- in addition to his lack of remorse and behavior during the trial -- could provide Judge Juan Merchan justification to impose a sentence that includes prison time, some experts told ABC News.  Of the 14 lawyers and law professors who spoke with ABC News, five believed an incarceratory sentence was likely, two described the decision as a toss-up, and seven believed a prison sentence was unlikely due to a combination of the logistical challenges, a lack of precedent supporting incarceration for first-time offenders, and the political implications of such a sentence. Regardless of the punishment, experts broadly agreed that Trump's sentence will most likely be stayed pending his appeal -- a process that could take anywhere from months to a year -- meaning the former president would likely avoid serving any part of a sentence until after the 2024 election. Ahead of the July 11 sentencing, Judge Juan Merchan faces the unprecedented question of how to punish the former president for crimes that prosecutors framed in the sharpest terms -- a \"subversion of democracy\" and \"election fraud, pure and simple\" -- but that were charged using the least severe class of felonies in New York. \"There is no more serious falsification of business records case that I can remember in the history of supervising and prosecuting many of these cases,\" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who previously served as the chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney's office. Compared to judges in federal court -- whose sentences are normally guided by a point system created by the United States Sentencing Commission -- Merchan has fewer reference points when sentencing Trump. New York's penal law limits prison sentences for Class-E felonies to four years, and probation officials will prepare a report with a recommendation for Trump's sentence, which Merchan can consider when weighing the nature and circumstances of the crime along with Trump's history and character. \"On behalf of New Yorkers -- that's who Judge Merchan is speaking up for -- how big a breach of the social trust was this compared to all the other crimes that he and other judges sentence every day?\" said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School. \"There is literally no case that has been remotely similar to the criminal prosecution conviction of a former chief executive of the country.\" Here are six questions that will likely shape how the judge forms his decision. While the Manhattan district attorney frequently charges defendants with falsifying business records -- there were 437 such charges by the office in the decade before Trump's indictment, according to a court filing last year -- Merchan might struggle to find relevant precedent in those cases, experts said. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg brought his case using a novel legal theory that Trump falsified business records to conceal a violation of a New York election law that prohibits conspiracies to influence an election using unlawful means. \"This isn't a run-of-the-mill falsifying business records case,\" former Manhattan assistant district attorney Jeremy Saland told ABC News. While first-time offenders convicted of falsifying business records normally avoid prison time, similar cases related to campaign contributions or public officials suggest incarceration is a possibility. Richard Brega, a New York bus mogul who pleaded guilty to one count of falsifying business records related to illegal campaign contributions, received a one-year prison sentence in 2018. Former New York Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who pleaded guilty to receiving a reward for official misconduct -- a class-E felony -- related to a pay-to-play scheme involving New York's pension fund, was sentenced in 2011 to one-to-four years in prison. \"Ultimately, this is a case that stands alone, and that is going to be extremely difficult for the judge to come up with a sentence that is fair and appropriate,\" said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor. Trump's status as a first-time offender, the nonviolent nature of his crime, his advanced age, and a lack of a flight risk are mitigating factors that could lighten his sentence, according to Pace University School of Law professor Bennett L. Gershman. However, Gershman cautioned that while Trump might be 78 years old at the time of his sentencing, many white-collar defendants receive prison time in spite of their advanced age. \"I would be shocked if he didn't impose some time in jail,\" Gershman said. \"Merchan imposes tough sentences. He's a tough judge from his history on the bench.\" Trump's lack of remorse or admission of wrongdoing could work against the former president at sentencing, where Merchan can consider Trump's overall history and character. Trump has also frequently targeted Merchan with personal attacks related to his daughter's political work and compared the judge to a \"tyrant\" and \"devil.\" Merchan also held Trump in criminal contempt ten times during the trial for knowingly making comments about witnesses and jurors in violation of the case's limited gag order. \"I think that most judges would feel that some kind of jail time is needed to basically affirm the need for a defendant to have respect for the court,\" said George Washington University professor Stephen Saltzburg. In addition to any purported rehabilitative or retributive purpose, prison sentences are often used by judges to deter the defendant or the broader public from committing similar crimes in the future. Some experts ABC News spoke with were skeptical that Merchan could justify a prison sentence based on individual deterrence -- i.e., discouraging Trump himself from committing a similar crime again. \"It's not necessarily clear to me that this is a situation that will arise again that could be specifically deterred,\" said former federal prosecutor Jarrod Schaeffer. \"Looking at Trump's behavior and his track record, I'm not sure that the judge will hold out hope that his sentence in this case will have a strong deterrent effect on him.\"  Yet the sentencing could provide an opportunity for general deterrence for the public, including other public officials, according to Jeffrey Cohen, a Boston College Law Associate professor. \"When you have a high-profile defendant, you want your punishment to discourage other people from doing this sort of thing,\" Cohen noted. Merchan could opt to sentence Trump to a period of probation or a conditional discharge. If sentenced to probation, Trump would have to report to a probation officer and meet certain conditions, including potential travel restrictions or curfews that could be enforced with the use of an ankle monitor, according to former federal prosecutor Michael Zweiback. However, enforcing the terms of Trump's probation in the middle of his presidential campaign could be challenging, according to New York Law School professor Anna Cominsky. \"The more restrictions on someone's movement sometimes makes it more difficult for them to live their lives and do their jobs,\" Cominsky said. \"So when it comes to Trump, part of his job is right now campaigning and traveling around the country. He has to be able to do that.\"  Trump alternatively could be sentenced to a conditional discharge where Judge Merchan himself would oversee that Trump meets the conditions of his release, rather than a probation officer. The conditions of Trump's release could include paying a fine, performing community service, and avoiding future arrests. \"He could be creative here, and I think that's sort of the wildcard, is that the judge does have a lot of discretion in fashioning a sentence,\" said former federal prosecutor Joshua Naftalis. Trump's sentencing comes just four days before the Republican National Convention, and the former president faces the possibility of serving part of his sentence while running for the presidency. The political undercurrent adds another layer of complexity to the already thorny sentencing, as the former president continues to allege without evidence that the prosecution against him was politically motivated. While Merchan could opt to disregard the political implications of the sentencing entirely, the broader ramifications of the sentence could play into Merchan's decision about the most effective punishment for the former president. \"There are political issues around sentencing him to a term of incarceration just before the convention, and that's feeding into a narrative that this prosecution was really to keep him from campaigning and keep him from regaining the office of president,\" said Bader. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Nadine El-Bawab","title":"Abortion pill challenges will continue with potential wider impacts ahead: Experts","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/challenges-abortion-pill-continue-potential-wider-consequences-ahead\/story?id=111096387","description":"What is the impact of the Supreme Court decision refusing to restrict access to abortion pill mifepristone?","date":"2024-06-13T21:55:59Z","content":"The U.S. Supreme Court refused to restrict nationwide access to mifepristone. While experts and advocacy groups applauded the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Thursday to not restrict nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone, they warn access to medication abortion remains at risk -- as does the very foundation of the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of all medications. The court unanimously struck down a lawsuit seeking to restrict nationwide access to mifepristone, one of the two pills used in an abortion medication regimen. The court ruled that a group of doctors have no grounds to bring the lawsuit that sought to roll back the FDA's approval of mifepristone. While it is only recommended for up to 11 weeks of pregnancy, the abortion pill regimen is the least expensive form of abortion care and has become the most common form of abortion care in the U.S. Medication abortion accounted for 63% of U.S. abortions in 2023, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute in March, and its use is growing. Medication abortions accounted for just 53% of all abortions in the U.S. in 2020, according to Guttmacher, a research and policy group that advocates for reproductive health. Women in states where abortion care has ceased or is restricted can still access the pills by mail under Thursday's ruling -- the biggest impact from the Supreme Court's decision. \"The idea of limiting access to mifepristone will just further exacerbate disparities that we're already seeing in terms of reproductive health care,\" said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a family physician, health services researcher and assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine.  Women who take the abortion pill can also go back to work or their daily lives quicker and patients see less days of bleeding and the likelihood of profound blood loss, Ramachandran said. The need to be seen by a physician is also reduced with the abortion pill regimen, compared to surgical abortions, she added. At least 17 states have ceased nearly all abortion care since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade nearly two years ago. Ramachandran called the Supreme Court decision \"a relief.\" \"While it is great that they dismissed it, the rationale for it is not as comforting because that just introduces the possibility that other groups where standing can be established could raise the same challenge and could work to limit access to mifepristone,\" said Ramachandran. \"I'm very cognizant that this still allows for additional challenges to come forward before the courts,\" Ramachandran said.  The American Civil Liberties Union also warned that the ruling was not the end of challenges to the abortion pill. \"Although the Court refused to allow these particular people to bring this case, anti-abortion politicians are waiting in the wings to attempt to continue pushing this case before an extremist judge in Texas in an effort to deny people access to medication abortion care,\" Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. The Guttmacher Institute also warned that mifepristone plays a key role in ensuring that many people safely self-manage their abortions, saying people need to remain \"vigilant\" with the anti-abortion movement continuing to try and risk care nationwide. \"We are relieved by this outcome, but we are not celebrating. From the start, this case was rooted in bad faith and lacking any basis in facts or science. This case never should have reached our nation\u2019s top court in the first place and the Supreme Court made the only reasonable decision by leaving access to medication abortion using mifepristone unchanged,\" Destiny Lopez, the acting co-CEO of the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement. The Supreme Court has not yet issued a decision on another case on its docket this term that could have a wider impact on lifesaving emergency abortion care across the country, including states that ban the procedure. The other case -- Moyle v. U.S. -- centers on Idaho's total abortion ban, which prohibits the procedure at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to save the life of a pregnant woman or in cases of rape or incest.  A Biden administration lawsuit challenging the ban argues that it violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act -- a federal law that requires emergency room physicians at hospitals that receive Medicare funds to provide stabilizing health care to all patients whose health is in jeopardy. It is now up to the court to determine whether the law, known as EMTALA, supersedes Idaho's abortion ban and protects physicians' ability to provide lifesaving abortion care. A decision in that case will be more consequential to abortion access across the country. At the heart of FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine -- the case decided Thursday -- was a fear that a Supreme Court decision could inject judges into decisions made by the experts at the FDA, not just for mifepristone but potentially other drugs. \"A number of us have been watching these court cases, and have been worried about the idea that judges -- without clinical or technical expertise -- would be weighing in on the scientific decisions that are being made by the FDA,\" said Ramachandran, who is also the chair of Doctors for America's task force on FDA policy. At least for now, the ruling keeps the power in the hands of the FDA. \"It's a very lengthy process to be able to get drug approval. There's multiple review teams of scientists, doctors, statisticians, basic scientists, they're all involved in looking at the data and making a determination if the drug is safe and effective for the indicated use before it comes into the market,\" Ramachandran said. \"As a doctor, I look to the FDA and providing reassurance that what they approve is truly safe and effective. ... It's very much a rubber stamp,\" Ramachandran said. The FDA is also then responsible for ensuring the safety of drugs once they are on the market, according to Sanket Dhruva, an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco School of Medicine who studies FDA regulation of drugs and medical devices. The FDA went \"above and beyond in terms of regulatory standards approval for mifepristone,\" because of the politicization of abortion care and the anticipation that there would be a number of different stakeholders looking at the drug, Ramachandran said. Had the court ruled differently, there was wide concern that it would set the dangerous precedent that judges -- who may not have the requisite expertise -- would limit patient access to products, Ramachandran said. \"It would also rather politicize the FDA's approval process, [for] drugs for gender-affirming care, for instance, and other reproductive health care -- medications, contraception -- which is kind of bizarre,\" Ramachandran said. Had the Supreme Court ruled differently it could have been \"catastrophic\" for drug development and regulation in the U.S., Dhruva said.  \"It could have potentially cast out on the FDA being the determinant of what drugs meet the safety and effectiveness threshold to be on the United States market,\" Dhruva said. \"There could have been larger issues for the drug development ecosystem because the industry might also have been more reluctant to invest in the whole process of drug development if there was this risk that the FDA might approve it. But then stakeholders -- whoever had whatever interest -- might come to the courts and the courts might invalidate the FDA's ability to approve a device,\" Dhruva said. If the court had determined that the FDA's authority over safety and fitness of drugs could be overturned, it would have led to a \"significant thawing of industry investment in pharmaceuticals,\" and threatened the development of new drugs, Dhruva said. \"I think it would have significantly threatened the development of drugs for conditions that we really need,\" Dhruva said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Pierre Thomas, Luke Barr","title":"Phoenix Police Department engaged in civil rights violations, DOJ finds","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/phoenix-police-department-engaged-civil-rights-violations-doj\/story?id=111099907","description":"The violations included \"unjustified deadly force,\" the DOJ said.","date":"2024-06-13T19:06:48Z","content":"The violations included \"unjustified deadly force,\" the DOJ said. A damning new report from the Justice Department released Thursday has concluded that the Phoenix Police Department has engaged in a \"pattern or practice of conduct\" that \"deprives people of their rights under the Constitution and federal law.\" A DOJ investigation found \"systemic problems\" within the department's policies, training, supervision and accountability systems that were \"perpetuated\" for years. In its report, the Justice Department found a spate of civil rights violations, including \"unjustified deadly force,\" discrimination in traffic and other enforcement, and unlawful detention, citations and arrests of the homeless.  The Phoenix Police Department has the highest rate of shootings of any major city, according to the report. The DOJ report claims Phoenix officers often fire weapons at people who aren't an immediate threat and often inappropriately escalate the violence. In addition to being \"reckless,\" officers are accused of delaying rendering emergency aid after a shooting. City police frequently rely on neck and compression restraints that could put people at risk for injury of suffocation, according to the report. \"PhxPD officers use these dangerous compression restraints against people experiencing a behavioral health crisis who do not present a risk to officers or others. In one incident, officers knelt for several minutes on the neck of a suicidal man who claimed to have stabbed himself with a nail file,\" according to the report. In another instance in 2021, the report cited, an officer squeezed his neck with both hands as he was attempting to get his ID. In Phoenix, Hispanics were 12 times more likely to get a minor traffic violation than their white counterparts. Black people are cited or arrested three times as often as white people for traffic-equipment related offenses, according to the report. The Justice Department's top civil rights attorney called the findings of the report \"severe\" and said that citizens of Phoenix deserve equal treatment under the law. \"Our investigation found that the police department discriminates against Black, Hispanic and Native American people in its enforcement activities,\" Kristen Clarke, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division told reporters on a virtual press conference. \"Police officers have an obligation to enforce the law fairly and equally, but in Phoenix, officers are disproportionately targeting communities of color.\" For example, she said, black drivers in Phoenix are 144% more likely than white drivers to be arrested or cited for low level moving violations, and Hispanic drivers are, for them, more likely to be arrested or cited for the same thing. DOJ also found that the Phoenix police intolerant of those who offered criticism and questioned how officers dealt with protesters. \"We found officers used indiscriminate force against protestors, falsified allegations to arrest protest leaders, retaliated against people critical of the police, and prevented people from lawfully recording police conduct,\" the report says. Furthermore, the Department of Justice said that while officers were on duty and responding to protests, officers made malicious and demeaning statements about protestors, cheered the use of force, and celebrated their success in suppressing speech. Regarding the Phoenix Police Department's response to people experiencing a behavioral health crisis, the DOJ said \"too frequently, they dispatch police alone when it would be appropriate to send behavioral health responders.\" \"Officers act on the assumption that people with disabilities are dangerous and rarely modify their approach,\" according to the report. \"Officers resort to using force rather than de-escalation tactics that would likely help a person with behavioral health disabilities follow directions. As a result, people with behavioral health disabilities suffer harm such as force, trauma, and criminal consequences, rather than receiving emergency mental health care.\" The police department has also had concerning contact with minors, the DOJ said. \"In 2022, officers handcuffed and used neck restraints on a 13-year-old boy with autism who had walked out of school without permission. An officer spotted the boy walking alongside a road near the school and told him to stop. The boy kept walking, and the officer ran after him, grabbing his arms from behind, tackling him, and holding him down. With the officer\u2019s knee in his back and hand on his neck, the boy pleaded to be let go: \u201cMy mom\u2019s right there. I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m just trying to get home,\" the report found. In August 2021, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the police department after complaints about excessive force. The Justice Department interviewed hundreds of officers, supervisors, commanders and current and former city officials during the process of compiling the report. \"The release of today\u2019s findings report is an important step toward accountability and transparency, and we are committed to working with the City of Phoenix and Phoenix Police Department on meaningful reform that protects the civil rights and safety of Phoenix residents and strengthens police-community trust,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. The City of Phoenix said in a statement the City will take the necessary time to review the findings in detail before responding. \u201cWe are taking all the DOJ\u2019s findings seriously and are planning to review this lengthy report with an open mind,\u201d City Manager Jeff Barton said in a message to City employees. \u201cSelf-reflection is an important step in continuous improvement, and our Police Department has demonstrated a commitment to continuous improvement by making enhancements to policy, internal investigations and training.\u201d 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Meredith Deliso, Melissa Griffin","title":"Gov.

The U.S. military is once again suspending operations of its pier off Gaza, temporarily moving the floating structure to an Israeli port to ride out high seas and rough waves expected to hit the region in coming days, officials said Friday. It's the latest setback for the ambitious $230 million humanitarian project involving 1,000 US troops and the third time in a month that military officials have had to halt aid deliveries via the pier due to weather. U.S. Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, said relocating the pier was necessary to prevent damage to the structure. \"The decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\" CENTCOM tweeted late Friday. \"After the period of expected high seas, the pier will be rapidly re-anchored to the coast of Gaza and resume delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.\"  Complicating the matter is that humanitarian aid that has been transported ashore via the pier is being held at a nearby facility after the United Nations suspended deliveries last week due to security concerns. The U.N. said Friday it does not have a timeline for when distribution might resume. The difficulties come as time is running out for the U.S. to make use of the temporary pier, which was initially slated as a 90-day project that would likely lose its ability to transit aid at the end of August, when heightened sea levels and more frequent storms would force military officials to take it down. Announced by President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address in March, the project was supposed to bring some two million meals a day into hunger-stricken Gaza while Israeli officials held up aid trucks at ground crossings, citing security concerns that some of the aid could reach Hamas.  CENTCOM on Friday said that more than 3,500 metric tons of humanitarian aid have been delivered via the pier so far, with about 1,000 tons of that delivered in the past two days. U.S. officials have acknowledged that much of that aid hasn't made it to its distribution points. Still, they say the pier has been key in moving ashore much-needed aid that wouldn't otherwise arrive and is intended to augment, not replace, aid moving via ground crossings. While it's the third time the U.S. military has paused shipments coming across the pier, it's the second time the system \u2013 called Joint Logistics over the Shore, or JLOTS \u2013 has been relocated. The first time the pier was relocated, it had broken apart in rough weather and needed repairs. This time, the pier is being disassembled and moved as a precautionary measure to prevent damage. The sputtering start has riled Republican critics who have called the pier an impractical political endeavor, rather than a serious foreign aid program. \"So far, the only accomplishment has been an increase in cost and risk for the 1,000 U.S. deployed troops,\" tweeted Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, this week called the project an \"irresponsible pier experiment\" that needs to be \"immediately terminated before catastrophe occurs.\" Citing the three service members who were injured while working on the pier, along with damaged Army vessels that ran aground, Rogers called it a waste of money and \"an embarrassment for the administration.\" \"This operation has failed and was never based in reality,\" he said in a statement. The Pentagon has defended the program as necessary to address a dire humanitarian situation. \"It's pretty important for the people that are suffering right now ... to get whatever aid they can by whatever means,\" Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters in May when the pier was temporarily inoperable. \"If you want to characterize it as a failure, I leave it to you.

The Justice Department on Friday said it has declined to prosecute Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress, according to a letter obtained by ABC News. The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to send a contempt referral to the Justice Department. House Republicans had demanded Garland turn over the audio of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur to the House Oversight and Judiciary committees and Garland refused. \"Consistent with this longstanding position and uniform practice, the Department has determined that the responses by Attorney General Garland to the subpoenas issued by the Committees did not constitute a crime, and accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" the Justice Department said.  The letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson cites what it called longstanding policy against prosecuting an attorney general. Johnson responded to the letter and announced on Friday the House will \"move to enforce the subpoena of Attorney General Garland in federal court.\" \"It is sadly predictable that the Biden Administration's Justice Department will not prosecute Garland for defying congressional subpoenas even though the department aggressively prosecuted Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro for the same thing. This is yet another example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration,\" he said in a statement.  After Wednesday's House vote, Johnson called the outcome \"a significant step in maintaining the integrity of our oversight processes and responsibilities.\" \"It is up to Congress \u2013 not the Executive Branch \u2013 to determine what materials it needs to conduct its own investigations, and there are consequences for refusing to comply with lawful Congressional subpoenas,\" he said in a statement. Garland, in response, said it was \"deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon.\" President Joe Biden asserted executive privilege over the recording of his Hur interview. The Justice Department said executive privilege holds in this case as has in many others. For example, the Justice Department took the same position in 2019 after then President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege after Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr did not turn over certain documents to the House Oversight Committee. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Maine opens contest to design a new state flag based on an old classic","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Lifestyle\/wireStory\/maine-opens-contest-design-new-state-flag-based-111138992","description":"Mainers are going to decide in November whether to adopt a new flag, but the state needs to settle on a design first","date":"2024-06-14T22:05:54Z","content":"Mainers are going to decide in November whether to adopt a new flag, but the state needs to settle on a design first AUGUSTA, Maine -- Mainers are going to decide in November whether to adopt a new flag, but the state needs to settle on a design first. Anyone can submit a design proposal as long as it's based on the state's original flag, which featured a simple pine tree and blue star against an off-white background. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows announced the flag contest Friday. The deadline is July 19. A modern version of that flag used from 1901 to 1909 took the state by storm during the Maine's bicentennial in 2020, and has appeared on hats, sweatshirts and soon license plates. This popularity played a role in lawmakers' approval of a bill last year to let Mainers vote on replacing the current flag, which features the state's official seal, a lumberjack, a sailor and the state's motto, Dirigo. That's Latin for \u201cI lead,\u201d a reference to the north star. The design process was without controversy until news reports of a similar-looking flag flown at the vacation home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. The flag featuring a pine tree and the words \u201cAN APPEAL TO HEAVEN\u201d dates to the Revolutionary War, but has recently been associated with the Christian nationalist movement and the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Bellows brushed aside a reporter's question about the flags' similarities at a news conference. \u201cThis is a debate delightfully free of partisan politics, and one that every Maine voter can weigh in on at the ballot box this fall,\u201d she said in a statement. The law requires Bellows to present the final design. \u201cThis duty bestowed upon me by the Legislature is not a job I can do alone. That\u2019s why today I invite every Mainer to consider submitting a design for consideration,\u201d she said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"LOLITA C.

U.S. Southern Command said the USS Helena, a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, pulled into the waters near the U.S. base in Cuba on Thursday, just a day after a Russian frigate, a nuclear-powered submarine, an oil tanker and a rescue tug crossed into Havana Bay after drills in the Atlantic Ocean. The stop is part of a \u201croutine port visit\u201d as the submarine travels through Southern Command's region, it said in a social media post. Other U.S. ships also have been tracking and monitoring the Russian drills, which Pentagon officials say do not represent a threat to the United States.  \u201cThis is not a surprise. We\u2019ve seen them do these type of port calls before,\u201d Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday when asked about the Russian drills. \u201cWe of course take it seriously, but these exercises don\u2019t pose a threat to the United States.\u201d The exercises, however, come less than two weeks after President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Russian President Vladimir Putin then suggested his military could respond with \u201casymmetrical steps\u201d elsewhere in the world.  Singh said it wouldn't be a surprise to see more Russian activity around the United States in such global exercises. The drills are in international waters, and U.S. officials expect the Russian ships to remain in the region through the summer and possibly also stop in Venezuela. Russia is a longtime ally of Venezuela and Cuba, and its warships and aircraft have periodically made forays into the Caribbean.  Russian ships have occasionally docked in Havana since 2008, when a group of Russian vessels entered Cuban waters in what state media described as the first such visit in almost two decades. In 2015, a reconnaissance and communications ship arrived unannounced in Havana a day before the start of discussions between U.S. and Cuban officials on the reopening of diplomatic relations. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Mary Kekatos","title":"Here's what to know about abortion pill mifepristone after Supreme Court decision","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/mifepristone-after-supreme-court-strikes-legal-challenge-abortion\/story?id=111091846","description":"After the Supreme Court decision striking down a legal challenge to mifepristone, here's what to know about the abortion pill.","date":"2024-06-13T17:23:57Z","content":"Mifepristone is typically used together with misoprostol to induce an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected on Thursday a bid by a group of antiabortion doctors that would have potentially blocked widespread access to a common abortion pill. In the opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court determined that the group had no legal standing to challenge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation of mifepristone. Here\u2019s what to know about the mifepristone, including how it works and how common it is.  Mifepristone is an oral drug typically used in combination with another drug, misoprostol, to induce an abortion or to help manage an early miscarriage. The medication works by blocking progesterone, a hormone that the body needs to continue a pregnancy. This causes the uterine lining to stop thickening and to break down, detaching the embryo. The second drug, misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours later, causes the uterus to contract and dilates the cervix, which will expel the embryo. The FDA authorized mifepristone -- sometimes called by the brand name Mifeprex -- for medication abortion in September 2000 for up to seven weeks' gestation, which was then extended to 10 weeks' gestation in 2016. However, the World Health Organization says the two drug-regimen can be taken up until the 12-week mark of pregnancy. In 2019, the FDA approved a generic version of the drug. Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group focusing on sexual and reproductive health.  As of 2023, medication abortions account for 63% of abortions performed in the U.S., up from 24% in 2011, the data from Guttmacher shows. Mifepristone is safe and effective when used as indicated and directed by the FDA, the agency said. When used in combination, mifepristone and misoprostol are nearly 97% effective at terminating a pregnancy, according to a 2015 systematic review from the University of California, Davis. In December 2021, the FDA announced it permanently lifted its restriction that abortion pills had to be dispensed in-person. In January 2023, it went further by allowing retail pharmacies to provide the drug too, either by mail or in person, so long as they meet certain requirements. Mifepristone is not recommended if a woman is more than 70 days out from their last menstrual period or if they have an ectopic pregnancy, have problems with glands near the kidney, have bleeding problems, are taking blood thinning medication, have an IUD in place or have had an allergic reaction to mifepristone. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press, KELVIN CHAN Associated Press","title":"Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to address a G7 summit","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/pope-francis-pontiff-address-g7-venue-raising-alarm-111115663","description":"Francis will address G7 leaders at their gathering in southern Italy","date":"2024-06-14T10:06:16Z","content":"Pope Francis has challenged leaders of the world\u2019s wealthy democracies to keep human dignity foremost in developing and using artificial intelligence BARI, Italy -- Pope Francis challenged leaders of the world\u2019s wealthy democracies on Frida y to keep human dignity foremost in developing and using artificial intelligence, warning that such powerful technology risks turning human relations themselves into mere algorithms. Francis brought his moral authority to bear on the Group of Seven, invited by host Italy to address a special session at their annual summit on the perils and promises of AI. In doing so, he became the first pope to attend the G7, offering an ethical take on an issue that is increasingly on the agenda of international summits, government policy and corporate boards alike. Francis said politicians must take the lead in making sure AI remains human-centric, so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less-lethal tools always remain made by humans and not machines. \u201cWe would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people\u2019s ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to ensure and safeguard a space for proper human control over the choices made by artificial intelligence programs: Human dignity itself depends on it.\u201d The G7 final statement largely reflected his concerns.  The leaders vowed to better coordinate the governance and regulatory frameworks surrounding AI to keep it \u201chuman-centered.\u201d At the same time, they acknowledged the potential impacts on the labor markets of machines taking the place of human workers and on the justice system of algorithms predicting recidivism.  \u201cWe will pursue an inclusive, human-centered, digital transformation that underpins economic growth and sustainable development, maximizes benefits, and manages risks, in line with our shared democratic values and respect for human rights,\u201d they said.  By attending the summit, Francis joined a chorus of countries and global bodies pushing for stronger guardrails on AI following the boom in generative AI kickstarted by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot. The Argentine pope used his annual peace message this year to call for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically. In it, he argued that a technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness is too perilous to develop unchecked. He didn't repeat that call explicitly in his speech Friday, but he made clear the onus is on politicians to lead on the issue. He also urged them to ultimately ban the use of lethal autonomous weapons, colloquially known as \u201ckiller robots.\u201d  \u201cNo machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being,\u201d he said.  On the weapons issue, the G7 leaders said they recognized the impact of AI in the military domain \u201cand the need for a framework for responsible development and use.\u201d They encouraged states to make sure \u201cmilitary use of AI is responsible, complies with applicable international law, particularly international humanitarian law, and enhances international security.\u201d Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni had invited Francis and announced his participation, knowing the potential impact of his star power and moral authority on the G7. Those seated at the table seemed duly awed, and the boisterous buzz in the room went absolutely quiet when Francis arrived. \u201cThe pope is, well, a very special kind of a celebrity,\u201d said John Kirton, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who directs the G7 Research Group think tank. Kirton recalled the last summit that had this kind of star power, that then translated into action, was the 2005 meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland. There, world leaders decided to wipe out the $40 billion of the debts owed by 18 of the world\u2019s poorest countries to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That summit was preceded by a Live 8 concert in London that featured Sting, The Who and a reformed Pink Floyd and drew over a million people in a show of solidarity against hunger and poverty in Africa. \u201cGleneagles actually hit a home run and for some it\u2019s one of the most successful summits,\u201d Kirton said. No such popular pressure was being applied to G7 leaders in the Italian region of Puglia, but Francis knew he could wield his own moral authority to renew his demands for safeguards for AI and highlight the threats to peace and society it poses if human ethics are left to the side. \u201cTo speak of technology is to speak of what it means to be human and thus of our singular status as beings who possess both freedom and responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means speaking about ethics.\u201d Generative AI technology has dazzled the world with its capabilities to produce humanlike-responses, but it\u2019s also sparked fears about AI safety and led to a jumble of global efforts to rein it in.  Some worry about catastrophic but far off risks to humanity because of its potential for creating new bioweapons and supercharging disinformation. Others fret about its effect on everyday life, through algorithmic bias that results in discrimination or AI systems that eliminate jobs. In his peace message, Francis echoed those concerns and raised others. He said AI must keep foremost concerns about guaranteeing fundamental human rights, promoting peace and guarding against disinformation, discrimination and distortion. On the regulation front, Francis was in some ways preaching to the converted as the G7 members have been at the forefront of the debate on AI oversight. Japan, which held the G7\u2019s rotating presidency last year, launched its Hiroshima AI process to draw up international guiding principles and a code of conduct for AI developers. Adding to those efforts, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida last month unveiled a framework for global regulation of generative AI, which are systems that can quickly churn out new text, images, video, audio in response to prompts and commands. The European Union was one of the first movers with its wide-ranging AI Act that\u2019s set to take effect over the next two years and could act as a global model. The act targets any AI product or service offered in the bloc\u2019s 27 nations, with restrictions based on the level of risk they pose. In the United States, President Joe Biden issued an executive order on AI safeguards and called for legislation to strengthen it, while some states like California and Colorado have been trying to pass their own AI bills, with mixed results. Britain kickstarted a global dialogue on reining in AI\u2019s most extreme dangers with a summit last fall. At a followup meeting in Seoul, companies pledged to develop the technology safely. France is set to host another meeting in the series early next year. The United Nations has also weighed in with its first resolution on AI. ___ Chan reported from London. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Max Zahn","title":"Bud Light boycott still hammers local distributors 1 year later: 'Very upsetting'","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/bud-light-boycott-hammers-local-distributors-1-year\/story?id=110935625","description":"\"Bud Light sales cratered and sat there,\" an industry analyst said.","date":"2024-06-14T10:08:35Z","content":"\"Sales cratered and sat there,\" an industry analyst said. When conservative activists set aflame boxes of Bud Light and urged a boycott in response to an endorsement from a trans influencer last spring, they sent sales of the beer plummeting in a rare success in the long history of consumer movements. Even more improbably, the backlash continues to hammer Bud Light and strain independent local wholesalers more than a year later, according to third-party sales data shared with ABC News as well as interviews with six Anheuser-Busch wholesalers. Most of the wholesalers, small- and medium-sized businesses that draw a significant portion of their revenue from Bud Light, said they remain weakened by the decline in sales and uncertain about when, if ever, the brand will fully recover. The owner of an Anheuser-Busch wholesaler in the Northeast, whose child is trans, told ABC News they have taken a 30% pay cut to make up for the losses and are considering retirement.  \u201cIt was really hurtful personally,\u201d the owner said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand what my kid is going through and then this happens.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still very upsetting,\u201d the owner added, noting the company\u2019s Bud Light sales declined by 50% in the immediate aftermath of the boycott. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to come in every day and look at those sales numbers, knowing I have a responsibility for everyone here.\u201d Another executive at a wholesaler in the Mid-Atlantic said they have spent sleepless nights devising ways to shed costs without laying off employees; and a top official at a distributor in the Southeast said they expect sales of Bud Light will remain down for at least two more years. Still, the wholesalers added, harassment of employees and drinkers has faded, indicating the boycott fervor has died down and the brand reputation of Bud Light has begun to mend. Many of the wholesalers said sales had improved lately and Bud Light remains their top-selling beer. The wholesalers requested anonymity because they didn't want to be publicly identified speaking about the financial consequences of the boycott. In all, roughly 500 independent distributors sell Anheuser-Busch products nationwide. In response to ABC News' request for comment, a spokesperson at Anheuser-Busch touted the success of Bud Light and the company's relationship with wholesalers. \u201cBud Light continues to be the number one selling beer brand in the country because for decades it has been synonymous with programs and activations that consumers love, including partnerships with the NFL, NHL, UFC, and College Football,\" the spokesperson said. \"As we have for nearly a century, we continue to work side-by-side with our 350+ wholesaler partners to drive growth for our collective business and provide best-in-class service to our consumers and retailers across the country,\" the spokesperson added. Sales of Bud Light declined by roughly 25% over the weeks following a product endorsement from Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender influencer, which sparked backlash among many conservatives last April, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting and Nielsen NIQ obtained by ABC News. In a video posted on Instagram, Mulvaney held a specially designed can of Bud Light featuring an illustration of her. The can, Mulvaney said, included a message congratulating her on \"365 days of womanhood.\" Until April of this year, sales of the beer stayed stuck at the same level while the boycott persisted, Dave Williams, the president of Bump Williams Consulting, told ABC News. \u201cSales cratered and sat there. They didn\u2019t get any worse but they sure as heck didn\u2019t get any better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of examples where the king of the castle, someone in such prominence, took such a public and drastic hit in beer.\u201d In recent months, sales have shown signs of improvement but remain well below pre-boycott levels, Williams added, noting that some customers appear to have returned to the brand as the social stigma has waned while others remain steadfast in their opposition. \u201cThe goal is to retain the consumers they have and hopefully try to win some back.\u201d An executive at a wholesaler in the Southeast said Bud Light sales plummeted by at least 20% in the aftermath of the boycott and remained at that level for the rest of 2023. The blow to the balance sheet hurt company morale and raised questions about the firm\u2019s future, the executive said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got employees who expected a career helping to build this brand and this business,\u201d the executive added. \u201cTo have that undone was a bit of a shock, to say the least.\u201d In recent months, hostility toward the brand has faded, sales have stabilized and morale has improved, the executive added, acknowledging that sales still stand well below pre-boycott levels. \u201cOnce a consumer drops off a product -- where there is a readily available and similarly priced substitute -- a habit has formed and it\u2019s difficult to shake that habit,\u201d the executive said. \u201cWe have to give them a reason to come back.\u201d Williams said Bud Light has returned to its spot as the top-selling U.S. beer by volume, even if revenue has lagged. Meanwhile, other Anheuser-Busch beer brands are performing better than they did before the boycott. Some wholesalers expressed optimism about Bud Light's outlook and praised Anheuser-Busch for providing financial support in response to the sales slump. They also downplayed the boycott's impact, attributing much of the sales decline to a wider shift away from beer to other alcoholic drinks. \u201cThe beer industry -- no matter what product you\u2019re selling -- is down in sales,\u201d Tom Davis, director of operations at Maryland-based Katcef Brothers, Inc., an Anheuser-Busch wholesaler, told ABC News. \u201cThat has a bigger impact on beer sales than anything.\u201d An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson shared a statement from a wholesaler with ABC News. \"Anheuser-Busch recognizes the vital role their wholesaler partners play in the business, and last year they stepped in to provide critical resources to ensure we were positioned to continue serving our consumers and communities across the country,\" Sarah Matesich Schwab, President of Ohio-based Matesich Distributing, said in the statement. \"There\u2019s lots of positive momentum in the system, and we are focused on strengthening our partnership so that we can continue to grow and succeed together,\" Matesich Schwab added.  The enduring impact of the Bud Light boycott defies a decadeslong history of largely ineffective consumer boycotts, Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who studies consumer movements, told ABC News. The continued struggle of Bud Light owes to the easy availability of similar products as well as the highly polarized political environment nationwide, Schweitzer said. \u201cGiven the history of boycotts and its history of ineffectiveness, it is really surprising that this one has had the staying power that it has,\u201d Schweitzer told ABC News. \u201cIn this moment, we\u2019re so politicized,\u201d Schweitzer added. \u201cThe weather is political, the employment rate is political and now beer is political.\u201d 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"Mary Kekatos","title":"WHO acknowledges bird flu patient in Mexico died of other medical conditions","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Health\/acknowledges-bird-flu-patient-mexico-died-medical-conditions\/story?id=111131166","description":"The WHO confirmed Friday that the patient in a fatal bird flu case in Mexico died due to his other severe medical conditions.","date":"2024-06-14T19:24:23Z","content":"The patient had been hospitalized for three weeks before contracting bird flu. The World Health Organization confirmed Friday that Mexican authorities believe the man with a rare human case of bird flu actually died from other co-morbidities. On June 5, the WHO shared an update that a 59-year-old patient died with the H5N2 strain of bird flu, or avian influenza. It was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of the H5N2 strain reported globally and the first-ever reported case in Mexico. This strain is different than the bird flu strain that is currently circulating in livestock in the United States. Three dairy workers have been infected in the U.S., all of whom have recovered.  Following the first release, Mexican Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer Varela pushed back on the WHO's statement, saying the man died from a separate condition and not bird flu, although the WHO said the patient only tested positive for bird flu, not that he had died of bird flu. In the latest update, the WHO said health officials in Mexico had concluded the man died because of his co-morbidities. \"A national multidisciplinary group of experts was formed to investigate the cause of death. It included infectious disease specialists, pneumonologists, microbiologists and intensive care professionals,\" the WHO wrote. \"Upon review of the patient's clinical history and records, the national multidisciplinary team concluded on 6 June that, although the patient had a laboratory-confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus, he died due to complications of his co-morbidities.\" Additionally, the WHO said national authorities performed a genetic analysis on the strain and found it had a 99% similarity with the strain seen in birds this year in the Texcoco State of Mexico. The Mexico patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, according to the WHO. Mexico has been dealing with an outbreak of the virus in poultry. On April 17, the patient developed fever, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath and general malaise. He was hospitalized on April 24 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City and died the same day. The patient's relatives said he had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons prior to contracting bird flu, the WHO said.  Mexican authorities reported the human case to the WHO on May 23. No further cases have been documented during health officials' investigation, according to the WHO. All the people the patient was in contact with at his home and in the hospital have tested negative for influenza viruses. In the U.S., an outbreak of the H5N1 strain has been found to sicken millions of birds as well as older dairy cows. So far, three farmworkers have been sickened in the U.S., one in Texas and two in Michigan. All three had mild symptoms and have recovered.

The friend called the police after he returned home Thursday and found the door of the house open, the lights on, the air conditioning unit on, but the missing American's ID and travel documents gone, along with the man himself, according to investigators.

In a secretive Christian sect unknown to most Americans, a reckoning is underway. Allegations of abuse that have been insular for so long are now coming to light. Sheri Autrey was 14 when she says she was abused by a 28-year-old man who was a minister in her church. She says her abuse happened every night for two months. \"He'd be touching me everywhere, kissing me,\" Autrey, now 55, told ABC News. \"And it was scary. It was scary because I knew if we got caught, I would be in trouble. I was the one doing something wrong.\" Autrey grew up in a secretive sect of Christianity known by outsiders as the 2x2 church. Within the church, members refer to it as \"The Truth\" or \"The Way\" or even call it the church that has no name. What makes this religion so unique is that the ministers, known as workers, live with the congregants, moving from one member home to another, sometimes living out of a single suitcase. Autrey's story isn't unique within her former religion. ABC News has been conducting an investigation for over a year into this organization, and has spoken to dozens of alleged survivors, from at least 34 states in the nation. The alleged abuse within the church spans generations, with some victims accusing the same perpetrator decades apart. One alleged victim said she was abused by a worker when she was 7 years old in 1955. \"The ministers stay in homes, they groom the family,\" Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who represents child sexual abuse victims, including one ex-2x2 member, told ABC News. \"The parents seem to have this enormous amount of trust, which is misplaced, in the religious person. And the parents are blind. Religion can be blind. Religion is great if it's used properly. But if it's not used properly, it's a disaster, it's evil.\" The claims were so widespread that the FBI announced in February that it started an investigation into the church. \"The FBI focuses, in general, on bringing cases from local to global,\" Eugene Kowel, Special Agent in Charge of the Omaha Field Office which is leading the investigation, told ABC News in a rare, exclusive interview. \"I'm trying to build an enterprise case. So, in general, the FBI doesn't stop at just an initial arrest. We will follow the evidence wherever it leads to ensure children are protected and to ensure anyone who can be held accountable is being held accountable by the criminal justice system.\" While the FBI declined to give ABC News specifics into the ongoing investigation, Cynthia Liles, a private investigator who has been looking into the church and also runs an advocacy group, said over 900 alleged perpetrators have been named. She says she provided that information to the FBI. Even former ministers of the church told ABC News that the abuse became pervasive. When asked if she felt that the church accepted abuse, former worker Sara Knauss responded, \"I wouldn't say accepted it, but pretended it didn't exist,\" Knauss said. Rather than calling the authorities, alleged abusers kept working, but in different states, according to former members. \"The typical response by the preachers when they're notified is for them to move the perpetrator to another area,\" Cherie Kropp-Ehrig, author of \"Preserving the Truth,\" told ABC News. \"And not to warn the people in the new area.\" The church has a global presence and while it operates differently in countries like Australia, the 2x2 church in the U.S. doesn't have one official leader; it has a group of leaders known as overseers. ABC News reached out to over 20 former and current overseers in the United States. All of them denied knowing about the widespread abuse. But one overseer acknowledged that workers were moved in the past, rather than being removed from the ministry and reported to authorities. \"The 'shuffling' of abusers from state to state, from country to country, is common,\" Garabedian said. People within the church knew about Autrey's abuse. Her parents wrote their overseer, Eldon Tenniswood, about her alleged abuser, Steve Rohs. In 1986, Tenniswood wrote Rohs in a letter obtained by ABC News, \"Remember, Steven, at that time you were 28 years old and she was 14 years old, which would make what you did a felony.\" Rohs admitted to the abuse, writing on May 11, 1986, in a response to Tenniswood's letter, \"We did\u2026 kiss and touch each other intimately. This did not happen with anyone else\u2026 I did not intend to cover this up, but I did not know how to handle it other than to leave the area and beg God to forgive me. I was old enough to know better, but still weak in the flesh.\" ABC News has spoken to two other alleged victims of Rohs, who say their abuse happened decades after Autrey's. To see Kyra Phillips' attempts to question Rohs and the full report into the Church, stream the \"IMPACT x Nightline\" episode \"Secrets of the 2x2 Church\" on Hulu beginning June 13. While Autrey grew up in California, she now lives in Texas with her husband Dean. With her dogs, cattle, and cowboy boots, she enjoys living a little more off the grid. \"What would you say to your 14-year-old self right now?\" ABC News asked Autrey. \"You're amazing,\" Autrey said. \"You're precious.

Eight-time Grammy award winner Usher Raymond made a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill Wednesday, urging lawmakers to make screening for Type 1 diabetes more accessible to Americans. \"Today, just talking about type 1 diabetes and early screening for type 1 diabetes,\" Usher, the Super Bowl LVIII performer, told ABC News after his meetings. Usher's child was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 2014. Before leaving, Usher acknowledged the issue was personal to him. \"Yeah, I've been able to share my story today. Hopefully, you'll get a chance to hear more about it,\" he said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes, and it often develops in children, teens, and young adults, but it can happen at any age. The CDC said the disease is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction. \"This reaction destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, called beta cells,\" the agency wrote on its website. \"This process can go on for months or years before any symptoms appear.\" Usher was first spotted riding the Senate Subway with Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock \u2013 then the Capitol press corps went on the hunt for the pop icon.  He made his way over to the House side, meeting with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other lawmakers as a mix of reporters and staffers congregated outside of the meeting. They patiently waited for a selfie as minutes turned to hours. At one point, emerging from the meeting in his tan suit, undershirt, and signature shades, Usher said, \"I had a great time here in D.C.,\" when asked about his conversations with lawmakers. Throughout the day, the music superstar met with lawmakers in both chambers about the SCREEN for Type 1 Diabetes Act \u2013 introduced yesterday and led by Reps. Schrier, DeGette, Joyce, and Bilirakis in the House and Sens. Shaheen and Collins in the Senate. The act aims to increase public awareness of the disease, including early detection of type 1 Diabetes. \"He has a family relationship with the issue and he's decided to speak out to raise awareness and I'm very, very grateful to him for doing that,\" Rep. DeGette said after the meeting broke. Her legislation is supported by the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and the American Medical Association, according to a release from DeGette. Prior to leaving the Capitol, Usher shared his plan to continue fighting for the cause in the future. \"It was my first time [up here] but it won't be my last,\" he said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"ABC News","title":"8 climate protestors arrested during Congressional Baseball Game: Police","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/8-climate-protestors-arrested-congressional-baseball-game-police\/story?id=111077381","description":"Eight climate protesters were arrested on Wednesday after being tackled on the field during the Congressional Baseball Game, U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. \"The eight people are being charged with federal charges - Interference with a Member of the \u2026","date":"2024-06-13T01:45:10Z","content":"The annual baseball game was met with pro-Palestinian and climate protesters. Two different groups of protesters interrupted the Congressional Baseball Game on Wednesday evening -- the annual charity game in which Republicans walloped Democrats for the fourth year in a row, 31 to 11. Eight climate protesters were arrested on Wednesday after being tackled on the field during the Congressional Baseball Game, U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. The self-described \"youth-led group,\" Climate Defiance, took credit for the protest and shared videos on X of protesters rushing the field, calling the \"Chevron-sponsored\" game \"unconscionable.\" During the second inning, over half a dozen protesters hopped the fence to the field, wearing shirts stating, \"END FOSSIL FUELS.\" Chants from the crowd of \"USA!\" drowned out the protesters. \"The eight people are being charged with federal charges - Interference with a Member of the U.S. Capitol Police,\" authorities said in a statement. The group was protesting outside of the stadium prior to the game's start and had been vocal for days leading up to the game about the planned protest. \"Before the charity game, we were aware that some people planned to possibly protest. This was discussed during our planning meetings and put in our comprehensive action plan to ensure we had plenty of resources to swiftly respond,\" Capitol police said in a statement on X.  Before the first pitch of the game had even been thrown, shouts rang out in the stands as roughly a dozen pro-Palestinian protesters began a demonstration opposing the U.S. government's support of Israel, which is more than eight months into the war with Hamas in Gaza. The demonstration, which began during the colors presentation, continued into the singing of the national anthem, prompting loud counter-chants of \"USA\" that originated in the Republican fan section before spreading throughout the stadium.  As they unfurled posters and Palestinian flags, security promptly removed the protesters, several of whom were clad in keffiyehs, the traditional Palestinian scarves that have become icons of the movement. In an interview given through an exterior fence of the stadium, one of the protesters spoke with ABC News, stating, \"We're here to shame Congress for participating and sponsoring and funding a genocide.\" The Congressional Baseball Game is a bipartisan tradition dating back to 1909, with proceeds supporting D.C.-area charities. The annual game has been under threat before. In 2017, at a practice for Republican lawmakers, then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner were shot.

Men really do eat more meat than women, study says","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/imagination-men-eat-meat-women-study-111093903","description":"It's a popular notion that men eat more meat than women","date":"2024-06-13T15:18:30Z","content":"It's a popular notion that men eat more meat than women CHICAGO -- Vacationing in Chicago this week from Europe, Jelle den Burger and Nirusa Naguleswaran grabbed a bite at the Dog House Grill: a classic Italian beef sandwich for him, grilled cheese for her. Both think the way their genders lined up with their food choices was no coincidence. Women, said Naguleswaran, are simply more likely to ditch meat, and to care about how their diet affects the environment and other people. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put it in the wrong way, that male people feel attacked,\u201d said Naguleswaran, of Netherlands, laughing. She said she used to love eating meat, but giving it up for climate reasons was more important to her. \u201cWe just have it in our nature to care about others.\u201d Now, scientists can say more confidently than ever that gender and meat-eating preferences are linked. A paper out in Scientific Reports this week shows that the difference is nearly universal across cultures \u2014 and that it\u2019s even more pronounced in countries that are more developed. Researchers already knew men in some countries ate more meat than women did. And they knew that people in wealthier countries ate more meat overall. But the latest findings suggest that when men and women have the social and financial freedom to make choices about their diets, they diverge from each other even more, with men eating more meat and women eating less. That's important because about 20% of planet-warming global greenhouse gas emissions come from animal-based food products, according to earlier research from the University of Illinois. The researchers behind the new report think their findings could fine-tune efforts to persuade people to eat less meat and dairy. \"Anything that one could do to reduce meat consumption in men would have a greater impact, on average, than among women,\" said Christopher Hopwood, a professor of psychology at the University of Zurich and one of the authors of the paper. The work drew on surveys funded by Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit dedicated to ending animal agriculture. Hopwood said he is not affiliated with the organization and is not an advocate. The researchers asked over 28,000 people in 23 countries on four continents how much of various types of food they ate every day, then calculated the average land animal consumption by gender identity in each country. They used the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education and standard of living, to rank how \u201cdeveloped\u201d each country was, and also looked at the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale of gender equality published by the World Economic Forum. They found that, with three exceptions \u2014 China, India and Indonesia \u2014 gender differences in meat consumption were higher in countries with higher development and gender equality scores. The large number and cultural diversity of people surveyed is \u201ca real strength of this,\u201d said Daniel Rosenfeld, a social psychologist at UCLA who studies eating behavior and moral psychology and was not involved in the study. The study did not answer the question of why men tend to eat more meat, but scientists have some theories. One is that evolutionarily, women may have been hormonally hardwired to avoid meat that could possibly have been contaminated, affecting pregnancy, whereas men may have sought out meat proteins given their history as hunters in some societies. But even the idea of men as hunters is intertwined with culture, Rosenfeld said. That's a good example of another theory, which is that societal norms shape gender identity from an early age and thus how people decide to fill their plates. Rosenfeld, who said he stopped eating meat about 10 years ago, said his own experience hanging out in college \u201cas a guy hanging out with other guy friends\u201d illustrated the cultural pressure for men to eat meat. \u201cIf they're all eating meats and I decide not to,\u201d he said, \u201cit can disrupt the natural flow of social situations.\u201d The same cultural factors that shape gender influence how people respond to new information, said Carolyn Semmler, a professor of psychology at the University of Adelaide in Australia who also studies meat eating and social factors like gender. Semmler was not involved in this study. In some of her past work, she's studied cognitive dissonance around eating meat. In those cases, she said women presented with information about poor animal welfare in the livestock industry were more likely to say they would reduce their meat consumption. But men tended to go the other direction, she said. \u201cOne participant said to me, \u2018I think you guys are trying to get me to eat less meat, so I\u2019m going to eat more,\u2019\u201d she said. Semmler said meat can be important to masculine identity, noting for example the popular notion of men at the grill. And she said presenting eating less meat as a moral cause can be a sensitive issue. Still, she said, people should be aware of how their food choices affect the planet. But she and Hopwood acknowledged how difficult it is to change behavior. \u201cMen are a tough nut to crack,\u201d Hopwood said. Jose Lopez, another diner at the Dog House Grill, said he thought men should eat less meat but said that in general he has observed otherwise.  \u201cWe\u2019re carnivores. Men eat like savages,\u201d he said.  ___ This story was first published on Jun. 13, 2024.

Gavin Newsom who says that the power is critical to safeguarding energy supplies amid a warming climate. The votes in the state Senate and Assembly on funding for the twin-domed Diablo Canyon plant represented an interim step as Newsom and legislative leaders, all Democrats, continue to negotiate a new budget. But it sets up a public friction point involving one of the governor\u2019s signature proposals, which he has championed alongside the state\u2019s rapid push toward solar, wind and other renewable sources. The dispute unfolded in Sacramento as environmentalists and antinuclear activists warned that the estimated price tag for keeping the seaside reactors running beyond a planned closing by 2025 had ballooned to nearly $12 billion, roughly doubling earlier projections. That also has raised the prospect of higher fees for ratepayers.  Operator Pacific Gas & Electric called those figures inaccurate and inflated by billions of dollars.  H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the California Department of Finance, emphasized that budget negotiations are continuing and the legislative votes represented an \u201cagreement between the Senate and the Assembly \u2014 not an agreement with the governor.\u201d The votes in the Legislature mark the latest development in a decades-long fight over the operation and safety of the plant, which sits on a bluff above the Pacific Ocean midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Diablo Canyon, which began operating in the mid-1980s, produces up to 9% of the state\u2019s electricity on any given day. The fight over the reactors' future is playing out as the long-struggling U.S. nuclear industry sees a potential rebirth in the era of global warming. Nuclear power doesn\u2019t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels, but it leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries. A Georgia utility just finished the first two scratch-built American reactors in a generation at a cost of nearly $35 billion. The price tag for the expansion of Plant Vogtle from two of the traditional large reactors to four includes $11 billion in cost overruns. In Wyoming, Bill Gates and his energy company have started construction on a next-generation nuclear power plant that the tech titan believes will \u201crevolutionize\u201d how power is generated. In 2016, PG&E, environmental groups and plant worker unions reached an agreement to close Diablo Canyon by 2025. But the Legislature voided the deal in 2022 at the urging of Newsom, who said the power is needed to ward off blackouts as a changing climate stresses the energy system. That agreement for a longer run included a $1.4 billion forgivable state loan for PG&E, to be paid in several installments. California energy regulators voted in December to extend the plant's operating run for five years, to 2030. The legislators' concerns were laid out in an exchange of letters with the Newsom administration, at a time when the state is trying to close an estimated $45 billion deficit. Among other concerns, they questioned if, and when, the state would be repaid by PG&E, and whether taxpayers could be out hundreds of millions of dollars if the proposed extension for Diablo Canyon falls through.  Construction at Diablo Canyon began in the 1960s. Critics say potential earthquakes from nearby faults not known to exist when the design was approved could damage equipment and release radiation. One fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&E has long said the plant is safe, an assessment the NRC has supported. Last year, environmental groups called on federal regulators to immediately shut down one of two reactors at the site until tests can be conducted on critical machinery they believe could fail and cause a catastrophe. Weeks later, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took no action on the request and instead asked agency staff to review it. The questions raised by environmentalists about the potential for soaring costs stemmed from a review of state regulatory filings submitted by PG&E, they said. Initial estimates of about $5 billion to extend the life of the plant later rose to over $8 billion, then nearly $12 billion, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite shocking,\u201d said attorney John Geesman, a former California Energy Commission member who represents the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, an advocacy group that opposes federal license renewals in California. The alliance told the state Public Utilities Commission in May that the cost would represent \u201cby far the largest financial commitment to a single energy project the commission has ever been asked to endorse.\u201d PG&E spokesperson Suzanne Hosn said the figures incorrectly included billions of dollars of costs unrelated to extending operations at the plant. The company has pegged the cost at $8.3 billion, Hosn said, adding that \u201cthe financial benefits exceed the costs.\u201d 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Esports Olympics set to launch after IOC presents proposal for video game project","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/esports-olympics-set-launch-after-ioc-presents-proposal-111125547","description":"The first Olympic Esports Games are set to be added soon to the IOC\u2019s portfolio of events as it seeks to attract and retain young audiences","date":"2024-06-14T14:22:17Z","content":"The first Olympic Esports Games are set to be added soon to the IOC\u2019s portfolio of events as it seeks to attract and retain young audiences LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The first Olympic Esports Games are set to be added soon to the IOC\u2019s portfolio of events as it seeks to attract and retain young audiences. The International Olympic Committee said Friday it will ask members to approve a proposal to create a video game Olympics when they meet next month in Paris on the eve of the Summer Games. The Olympic body said it was in \u201cadvanced discussions with a potential host\u201d that should be announced soon after the July 23-24 meeting in Paris. \u201cThe IOC is taking a major step forward in keeping up with the pace of the digital revolution,\u201d its president Thomas Bach said in an online briefing. The Esports Olympics will build on an IOC-backed week of video game competitions held last year in Singapore. It was a mix of physical simulations of Olympic sports and traditional video games.  The IOC said 75% of viewers engaging with the Singapore events were between the ages of 13 to 34. The new project is another win inside Olympic circles for the French official David Lappartient, who is increasingly seen as being presented as a potential IOC leadership candidate. Lappartient, the president of cycling\u2019s governing body, was given the esports brief by Bach several years ago. Last year, he also was elected to lead France\u2019s Olympic body and steered a French Alps bid to be the surprise preferred bid of the IOC to host the 2030 Winter Games. Sweden had been the favorite. Bach said on Friday it was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d that Lappartient would stay involved with the Esports Olympics project. Seeking to reassure Olympic sports which do not have an esports presence, Bach said the video games event would have a financial model separate from the current sharing of revenue from the Summer Games and Winter Games. \u201cWe are not entering into financial adventures which would put their subventions at risk,\u201d Bach said, referring to Olympic sports governing bodies which get shares from IOC funding worth hundreds of millions of dollars every four years. ___ AP Olympics: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/2024-paris-olympic-games 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Tesla stockholders vote to restore Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was tossed out by a Delaware judge","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/tesla-stockholders-vote-restore-elon-musks-record-449-111107966","description":"Tesla stockholders vote to restore Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was tossed out by a Delaware judge","date":"2024-06-13T21:18:04Z","content":"Tesla stockholders vote to restore Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was tossed out by a Delaware judge AUSTIN, Texas -- Tesla stockholders vote to restore Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was tossed out by a Delaware judge. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"CHRISTINA LARSON AP science writer","title":"What could make a baby bison white?","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/make-baby-bison-white-111103538","description":"Photos of a white bison calf in Yellowstone National Park have generated excitement as well as questions: How does that happen","date":"2024-06-13T22:14:25Z","content":"Photos of a white bison calf in Yellowstone National Park have generated excitement as well as questions: How does that happen WASHINGTON -- Photos of a white bison calf in Yellowstone National Park have generated excitement as well as questions: How does that happen? A park visitor said she took the photographs in the park earlier this month, showing a fuzzy white youngster being nuzzled by its dark brown mother. Park officials said this week that they hadn\u2019t yet spotted a white calf in the sprawling park in Wyoming and Montana, home to about 5,000 bison, also called American buffalo. In the wild, there are two genetic variations that may result in unusually light-colored animals \u2014 leucism and albinism. In both conditions, the animal inherits two copies of the gene mutation \u2014 one from each parent, who usually appear normally colored themselves. Leucistic animals lack some cells that otherwise produce melanin, a natural pigment that gives color to fur, eyes, feathers and skin. Their bodies may appear almost entirely white, or only white in patches, and they generally have normal or dark-colored eyes.  Albinism, which is more rare, results from the complete absence of melanin. Albino animals are nearly totally white, and they may have light pink or orange-colored eyes and reduced vision. Albino bison will lack dark colors in their eyes, noses and hooves, said James Derr, a geneticist at Texas A&M University.  The Yellowstone calf, with its black nose and eyes, is not albino, said Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association. There's a third possibility: A light-colored calf could be the result of a bison crossed with a white domestic cow. In that case, the calf may be light tan-colored, with brown eyes and a black or brown nose, said Derr.  Matheson said that it's unclear how often white bison calves are born in the wild.  \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how often it happens because we\u2019ve never tracked this in history,\" he said. ___ AP reporter Amy Beth Hanson in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

Maura Healey, a move advocates say was long overdue BOSTON -- A bill aimed at outlawing \u201crevenge porn\u201d has been approved by lawmakers in the Massachusetts House and Senate and shipped to Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, a move advocates say was long overdue. If signed by Healey, the bill \u2014 which bars the sharing of explicit images or videos without the consent of those depicted in the videos \u2014 would leave South Carolina as the only state not to have a law specifically banning revenge porn. Supports say the bill, which landed on Healey's desk Thursday, would align Massachusetts with the other 48 states that have clear prohibitions on disseminating sexually explicit images and videos without the subject\u2019s consent. It is a form of abuse that advocates say has grown increasingly common in the digital age, subjecting people to social and emotional harm often inflicted by former romantic partners.  The bill would make disseminating nude or partially nude photos of another person without their permission criminal harassment. Offenders would face up to two and a half years in prison and a fine of $10,000. On subsequent offenses, the punishment would increase to up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $15,000.  \u201cNo person\u2019s life should devolve into chaos because a private photo was shared without their permission, and no person should fear coercion or be threatened with the sharing of such a photo,\" Senate President Karen Spilka said. The bill explicitly states that even though a person might consent to the initial creation of an explicit image or video that doesn't mean they are also agreeing that it can be distributed without their additional consent in the future. The advent of artificial intelligence and deepfake technology in the creation of revenge porn has added to the concerns of lawmakers. Supporters said the bill opens the door to legislation further addressing the implications of the emerging technology. Karissa Hand, an aide to Healey, said the governor, who was previously the state\u2019s attorney general, \u201chas long supported legislation to ban revenge porn and hold accountable those who would engage in abusive, coercive and deeply harmful behavior\u201d and looks forward to reviewing any legislation that reaches her desk. The legislation establishes a definition for coercive control to account for non-physical forms of abuse such as isolation, threatening harm toward a family member or pet, controlling or monitoring activities, damaging property, publishing sensitive information, and repeated legal action.  Advocates describe coercive control as a pattern of deliberate behavior by an abuser that substantially restricts another person\u2019s safety and autonomy. By expanding the statute of limitation for domestic violence charges to 15 years, the bill would also give survivors a longer time to seek justice. Under current law, minors who possess, purchase or share explicit photos of themselves or other minors are charged with violating child sexual abuse image laws and are required to register as sex offenders.  The bill would instead require the state attorney general to develop an educational diversion program to provide adolescents who engage in revenge porn with information about the consequences and life-altering effects caused by engaging in the behavior. District attorneys would still have the authority to petition the court to bring criminal charges in extreme cases. Jane Doe Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, called passage of the bill in the Legislature \u201ca milestone for survivors in Massachusetts.\u201d \u201cNon-consensual sharing of intimate images impacts thousands of people in Massachusetts every year, and increases an individual\u2019s likelihood of further sexual harm,\u201d the group said in a written statement.  \u201cThis bill takes a thoughtful approach to addressing the problem - one that balances strong protections for survivors with a recognition that younger people who cause this harm often can and should benefit from educational diversion over prosecution,\u201d the group added. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"MIKE STOBBE AP medical writer","title":"Bird flu is highly lethal to some animals, but not to others.

It's killed legions of seals and sea lions, wiped out mink farms, and dispatched cats, dogs, skunks, foxes and even a polar bear.  But it seems to have hardly touched people. That's \"a little bit of a head scratcher,\u201d although there are some likely explanations, said Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. It could have to do with how infection occurs or because species have differences in the microscopic docking points that flu viruses need to take root and multiply in cells, experts say. But what keeps scientists awake at night is whether that situation will change. \u201cThere's a lot we don't understand,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director who currently heads Resolve to Save Lives, a not-for-profit that works to prevent epidemics. \u201cI think we have to get over the 'hope for the best and bury our head in the sand' approach. Because it could be really bad.\" Some researchers theorize that flu viruses that originated in birds were the precursors to terrible scourges in humans, including pandemics in 1918 and 1957. Those viruses became deadly human contagions and spread in animals and people. A number of experts think it\u2019s unlikely this virus will become a deadly global contagion, based on current evidence. But that's not a sure bet. Just in case, U.S. health officials are readying vaccines and making other preparations. But they are holding off on bolder steps because the virus isn't causing severe disease in people and they have no strong evidence it\u2019s spreading from person to person.  The flu that's currently spreading \u2014 known as H5N1 \u2014 was first identified in birds in 1959. It didn\u2019t really begin to worry health officials until a Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 that involved severe human illnesses and deaths. It has caused hundreds of deaths around the world, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected birds. When there was apparent spread between people, it involved very close and extended contact within households. Like other viruses, however, the H5N1 virus has mutated over time. In the last few years, one particular strain has spread alarmingly quickly and widely.  In the United States, animal outbreaks have been reported at dozens of dairy cow farms and more than 1,000 poultry flocks, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Four human infections have been reported among the hundreds of thousands of people who work at U.S. poultry and dairy farms, though that may be an undercount. Worldwide, doctors have detected 15 human infections caused by the widely circulating bird flu strain. The count includes one death \u2014 a 38-year-old woman in southern China in 2022 \u2014 but most people had either no symptoms or only mild ones, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's no way to know how many animals have been infected, but certain creatures seem to be getting more severe illnesses.  Take cats, for example. Flu is commonly thought of as a disease of the lungs, but the virus can attack and multiply in other parts of the body too. In cats, scientists have found the virus attacking the brain, damaging and clotting blood vessels and causing seizures and death.  Similarly gruesome deaths have been reported in other animals, including foxes that ate dead, infected birds. The flu strain's ability to lodge in the brain and nervous system is one possible reason for \"higher mortality rate in some species,\u201d said Amy Baker, an Iowa-based U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist who studies bird flu in animals. But scientists \"just don\u2019t know what the properties of the virus or the properties of the host are that are leading to these differences,\u201d Baker said. Unlike cats, cows have been largely spared. Illnesses have been reported in less than 10% of the cows in affected dairy herds, according to the USDA. Those that did develop symptoms experienced fever, lethargy, decreased appetite and increased respiratory secretions.  Cow infections largely have been concentrated in the udders of lactating animals. Researchers investigating cat deaths at dairy farms with infected cows concluded the felines caught the virus from drinking raw milk. Researchers are still sorting out how the virus has been spreading from cow to cow, but studies suggest the main route of exposure is not the kind of airborne droplets associated with coughing and sneezing. Instead it's thought to be direct contact, perhaps through shared milking equipment or spread by the workers who milk them. Then there's the issue of susceptibility. Flu virus need to be able to latch onto cells before they can invade them.  \u201cIf it doesn't get into a cell, nothing happens. ... The virus just swims around,\u201d explained Juergen Richt, a researcher at Kansas State University.  But those docking spots \u2014 sialic acid receptors \u2014 aren't found uniformly throughout the body, and differ among species. One recent study documented the presence of bird flu-friendly receptors in dairy cattle mammary glands. Eye redness has been a common symptom among people infected by the current bird flu strain. People who milk cows are eye level with the udders, and splashes are common. Some scientists also note that the human eye has receptors that the virus can bind to. A study published this month found ferrets infected in the eyes ended up dying, as the researchers demonstrated that the virus could be as deadly entering through the eyes as through the respiratory tract. Why didn't the same happen in the U.S. farmworkers? Some experts wonder whether people have some level of immunity, due to past exposure to other forms of flu or to vaccinations. However, a study in which human blood samples were exposed to the virus indicated there's little to no existing immunity to this version of the virus, including among people who'd had seasonal flu shots. A more menacing question: What happens if the virus mutates in a way that makes it more lethal to people or allows it to spread more easily?  Pigs are a concern because they are considered ideal mixing vessels for bird flu to potentially combine with other flu viruses to create something more dangerous. Baker has been studying the current strain in pigs and found it can replicate in the lungs, but the disease is very mild.  But that could all change, which is why there's a push in the scientific community to ramp up animal testing.  Frieden, of Resolve to Save Lives, noted public health experts have been worried about a deadly new flu pandemic for a long time.  \u201cThe only thing predictable about influenza is it's unpredictable,\u201d he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

Kennedy International Airport suddenly blurted out an expletive, then ordered the pilots to stop their takeoff roll. The controller saw an American Airlines plane mistakenly crossing the same runway, into the path of the accelerating Delta jet. JFK is one of only 35 U.S. airports with the equipment to track planes and vehicles on the ground. The system alerted the airport control tower to the danger, possibly saving lives last year. The National Transportation Safety Board and many independent experts say pilots should get warnings without waiting precious seconds to get word from controllers. Just last week, the NTSB recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration collaborate with manufacturers to develop technology for alerting pilots directly. Honeywell International, a conglomerate with a big aerospace business, has been working on such an early-warning system for about 15 years and thinks it is close to a finished product. The company gave a demonstration during a test flight last week. As pilot Joe Duval aimed a Boeing 757 for a runway in Tyler, Texas, a warning appeared on his display and sounded in the cockpit: \u201cTraffic on runway!\u201d The system had detected a business jet that was just appearing as a speck on the runway about a mile away \u2014 ground the Boeing would cover in a matter of seconds. Duval tilted the plane's nose up and pushed the throttle forward into a G-force-inducing climb, safely away from the Dassault Falcon 900 below. Honeywell officials claim their technology would have alerted the Delta pilots who had the January 2023 near-miss at JFK 13 seconds before the air traffic controller screamed the expletive and told them to stop their takeoff. Merely removing the need for a controller to relay the warning from ground-based systems could be critical. \u201cThose are microseconds, but they are enough to make a difference,\u201d Michael McCormick, a former FAA official who now teaches air-traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said. \u201cProviding alerts directly to the cockpit is the next step. This puts the tool in the hands of the pilot who actually has control of the aircraft. This technology is a game-changer.\" Honeywell plans to layer the cockpit-alert system on top of technology that is already in wide use and warns pilots if they fly too low. Incidents like the one at JFK are called runway incursions \u2014 a plane or ground vehicle is on a runway when it shouldn\u2019t be. Some incursions are caused by pilots entering a runway without clearance from air traffic controllers. In other cases, there isn't enough spacing between planes that are landing or taking off, which can be the fault of pilots or controllers. The number of incursions fell during the coronavirus pandemic and has not returned to the recent peaks of more than 2,000 incidents recorded in both 2016 and 2017. However, the most serious ones \u2014 where a collision was narrowly avoided or there was a \u201csignificant potential\u201d for a crash \u2014 have been rising since 2017. There were 23 in the United States last year, up from 16 in 2022, according to FAA statistics. Reducing incursions has always been a priority for FAA \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the greatest risk lies in the aviation system,\u201d said McCormick, the former FAA official.  The worst accident in aviation history occurred in 1977 on the Spanish island of Tenerife, when a KLM 747 began its takeoff roll while a Pan Am 747 was still on the runway; 583 people died when the planes collided in thick fog.  Earlier this year, a Japan Airlines jet landing in Tokyo collided with a Japanese coast guard plane that was preparing to take off. Five crew members on the coast guard plane died, but all 379 people on board the airliner escaped before it was destroyed by fire.  The FAA has paid for airport improvements designed to reduce incursions, such as reconfiguring confusing taxiways. It has also paid for technology to alert people in the control tower when a plane is lined up to land on a taxiway instead of a runway.  That type of landing error nearly happened in 2017 in San Francisco, when an Air Canada jet pulled up at the last second to avoid crashing into four jets on the taxiway that were carrying about 1,000 passengers between them. The FAA is also rolling out more simulators for controllers to practice directing traffic during times of low visibility. The NTSB last week recommended that the FAA require annual refresher training. The suggestion came after the NTSB determined that a controller who nearly caused a catastrophic crash between a FedEx plane and a Southwest Airlines jet during heavy fog in Austin, Texas, last year had not trained for low-visibility conditions in at least two years. The NTSB's examination of the February 2023 close call in Austin also renewed attention on technology to provide cockpit warnings of possible incursions and included a brief reference to the system Honeywell is developing. The FAA has not certified the system, which Honeywell calls \u201cSurf-A\u201d for surface alerts, but the company thinks certification could happen in the next 18 months.  The FAA\u2019s best technology against runway incursions is a system called ASDE-X that lets controllers track planes and vehicles on the ground. But it is expensive, so it\u2019s only at 35 of the 520 U.S. airports with a control tower. \u201cSome people thought ASDE-X was the solution,\u201d former NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said. \u201cThe problem is, there are a lot more than 35 air-carrier airports. A product (that warns pilots in the cockpit) goes to every airport that the airplane goes to.\u201d Honeywell, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, began working on a cockpit warning system around 2008 and tried to convince airlines to support the idea, but it says it found no takers. The company suspended the project when the pandemic devastated aviation in 2020. Then, as air travel recovered early last year, there were a series of high-profile close calls between planes at major U.S. airports, including the ones at JFK and Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport. \u201cTraffic was picking up. You were having more of the near-misses,\" said Thea Feyereisen, part of the Honeywell team working on the system. The timing was right to revive the warning system. \u201cPreviously, when we would talk to airlines, they were not interested. Last year, we go talk to the airlines again, and now they\u2019re interested,\" she said. Still, Honeywell doesn\u2019t have a launch customer, and company officials won\u2019t say how much it would cost to outfit a plane. Feyereisen was asked if the system would have prevented the close calls in New York and Austin. \u201cWhat our lawyers tell us to say (is) we reduce the risk of a runway incursion. We provide the pilot more time to make a decision\u201d whether to, for example, call off a landing and fly around the airport instead, she said. \u201cStill, the pilot needs to make a decision.\u201d 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"TOM KRISHER AP auto writer","title":"Future of Elon Musk and Tesla are on the line as shareholders vote on massive pay package","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/future-elon-musk-tesla-line-shareholders-vote-massive-111085545","description":"If Tesla shareholders approve an all-stock compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that was thrown out by a Delaware judge, it would almost guarantee he would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles","date":"2024-06-13T11:34:26Z","content":"Tesla shareholders have voted to restore CEO Elon Musk\u2019s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year DETROIT -- Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to restore CEO Elon Musk's record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year, sending a strong vote of confidence in his leadership of the world's largest electric vehicle maker. The favorable vote doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon. The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge's rejection. Musk has raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25% stake in the company in order to stop him from taking artificial intelligence development elsewhere. The higher stake is needed to control the use of AI, he has said. Tesla also has struggled with falling sales and profit margins as demand for electric vehicles slows worldwide. But at the company's annual meeting Thursday in Austin, Texas, Musk reassured shareholders that he will stick around, telling them he can't sell any stock in the compensation package for five years.  \u201cIt's not actually cash, and I can't cut and run, nor would I want to,\u201d he said. The company said late Thursday that shareholders had voted for Musk's compensation plan, which initially was approved by the board and stockholders six years ago. Tesla last valued the package at $44.9 billion in an April regulatory filing. It was once as much as $56 billion but has declined in value in tandem with Tesla's stock, which has dropped about 25% so far this year. Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled in January in a shareholder\u2019s lawsuit that Musk essentially controlled the Tesla board when it ratified the package in 2018, and that it failed to fully inform shareholders who approved it the same year. Tesla has said it would appeal, but asked shareholders to reapprove the package at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting. A separate vote approved moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas to avoid the courts in Delaware, where Tesla is registered as a corporation. \u201cIts incredible,\" a jubilant Musk told the crowd gathered at Tesla's headquarters and large factory in Austin, Texas. \u201cI think we\u2019re not just opening a new chapter for Tesla, we\u2019re starting a new book.\u201d Musk and Tesla didn\u2019t win everything. Shareholders approved measures that trimmed board member terms from three years to one and cut the required vote on shareholder proposals to a simple majority. Legal experts say the issue of Musk\u2019s pay will still be decided in Delaware, largely because Musk\u2019s lawyers have assured McCormick they won\u2019t try to move the case to Texas. But they differ on whether the new ratification of the pay package will make it easier for Tesla to get it approved. Charles Elson, a retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said he doesn\u2019t think the vote will influence McCormick, who issued a decision based on the law. McCormick\u2019s ruling essentially made the 2018 compensation package a gift to Musk, Elson said, and that would need unanimous shareholder approval, an impossible threshold. The vote, he said, is interesting from a public perception standpoint, but \u201cin my view it does not affect the ruling.\u201d John Lawrence, a Dallas-based lawyer with Baker Botts who defends corporations against shareholder lawsuits, agreed the vote doesn\u2019t end the legal dispute and automatically give Musk the stock options. But he says it gives Tesla a strong argument to get the ruling overturned. He expects Musk and Tesla to argue that shareholders were fully informed before the latest votes, so McCormick should reverse her decision. But the plaintiff in the lawsuit will argue that the vote has no impact and isn\u2019t legally binding, Lawrence said. The vote, he said, was done under Delaware law and should be considered by the judge.  \u201cThis shareholder vote is a strong signal that you now have an absolutely well-informed body of shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judge in Delaware still could decide that this doesn\u2019t change a thing about her prior ruling and doesn\u2019t require her to make any different ruling going forward. But I think it definitely gives Tesla and Musk strong ammunition to try to get her to revisit this.\u201d If the ruling stands, then Musk likely will appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, Lawrence said. Multiple institutional investors have come out against Musk\u2019s sizeable payout, some citing the company\u2019s recent struggles. But analysts said votes by individual shareholders likely put Musk\u2019s pay over the top. Early Friday, Tesla disclosed that shareholders voted for Musk's pay package by 1,760,780,650 to 528,908,419, with about 77% of all votes in favor. The company's shares jumped 3% by the time the markets closed Thursday and were up 1.2% in premarket trading early Friday.  After the votes were announced, Musk began telling shareholders about new developments in the company's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system. He has staked the company's future on development of autonomous vehicles, robots and artificial intelligence. \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d keeps improving with new versions, and its safety per mile is better than human drivers, Musk said.  \"This is actually going to work. This is going to happen. Mark my words, this is just a matter of time,\u201d he said.  Despite its name, \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d can\u2019t drive itself, and the company says human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d hardware went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since as the company gathered data to teach its computers how to drive.  In 2019, Musk promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said in early 2022 that the cars would be autonomous that year. In April of last year, Musk said the system should be ready in 2023. Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d using volunteer owners. U.S. safety regulators last year made Tesla recall the software after finding that the system misbehaved around intersections and could violate traffic laws.  Musk also said the company is making huge progress on its Optimus humanoid robot. Currently it has two working at its factory in Fremont, California, that take battery cells off a production line and put them in shipping containers, he said. Despite laying off the team working on Tesla\u2019s Supercharger electric vehicle charging network, Musk said he thinks the company will deploy more chargers this year \u201cthat are actually working\u201d than the rest of the industry. In the second half of the year, he expects to spend $500 million on Superchargers, Musk said. ____ Hamilton reported from San Francisco.  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"KAITLYN HUAMANI Associated Press","title":"Joey Chestnut, Takeru Kobayashi to compete in Netflix competition","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/joey-chestnut-takeru-kobayashi-compete-netflix-competition-111076762","description":"After organizers for Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest said Joey Chestnut wouldn\u2019t compete this year due to a deal with a rival brand, Netflix swiftly announced a new hot dog-eating competition that will feature Chestnut and his \u201cfi...","date":"2024-06-13T00:06:27Z","content":"Netflix has announced a new hot dog-eating contest between rivals Joey Chestnut and Takeru Kobayaski LOS ANGELES -- After organizers for Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog-eating contest said Joey Chestnut wouldn\u2019t compete this year because of a deal with a rival brand, Netflix swiftly announced a new hot dog-eating competition that will feature Chestnut and his \u201cfiercest rival.\u201d Chestnut, a 16-time hot dog-eating champion, will face off with his frequent Nathan\u2019s competitor, Takeru Kobayashi, in a live Netflix special on Sept. 2, the streamer announced Wednesday.

The Justice Department and Google had been expected to make their arguments seeking summary judgment in the lawsuit next week. But at a hearing Friday in federal court in Alexandria on unrelated issues, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema told both sides that it's clear the case has to go trial. A judge grants summary judgment only when the facts are not in dispute and a decision can be rendered as a matter of law. But Brinkema said it's clear that numerous facts are disputed. Her ruling was not unexpected. The lawsuit alleges that Google violated federal antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising.

Google did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pichai told jurors. \u201cMr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,\" he explained.  But \u201cdid you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?\u201d prosecutor Dylan Stern asked. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Pichai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.  He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.  According to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pichai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.  Ozy Media lawyer Shannon Frison said in an emailed statement Friday that it's \u201cunequivocally untrue\" that Watson told anyone that Google had made a $600 million offer.  \u201cHe never had such a conversation with Google and never told any person that he did,\u201d Frison said.  Watson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial \u201cmistakes.\u201d Defense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.  He testified earlier in the trial that his \u201cmoral compass\u201d got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and \u201cCarlos\u2019 deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.\u201d Among other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive \u2014 even using a phone app to disguise his voice \u2014 in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.  \u201cIt was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,\u201d Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode \u201ca surreal experience.\u201d  Rao testified that he did the phone trick to back up a false claim that YouTube was paying for Watson\u2019s eponymous talk show. Rao said Watson was with him during the call, texting him about what to say: \u201cI am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,\u201d read one text that was shown to jurors.  Defense lawyer Ronald Sullivan Jr. has said Watson came into the room during the call, realized \u201ca live train wreck\u201d was unfolding and tried to get Rao to end the conversation. On the other end, Moerman thought the putative YouTube exec's voice seemed obviously \u201coff,\u201d among other clues that made the Goldman bankers suspicious, he recalled Friday.  One of his colleagues soon called the actual executive at YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet. The ruse unraveled. So did the potential for a Goldman investment.  \u201cWe had been lied to,\u201d Moerman explained to the Brooklyn federal court jury. Goldman Sachs did keep advertising with Ozy after the episode, according to Rao's testimony.  Watson told Goldman and Ozy\u2019s board that Rao had suffered a mental health crisis. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants at the time but wasn't having a psychiatric break. ___ This story has been updated with the correct spelling of Google and Alphabet Inc.

He announced that he had told the National Rifle Association that \u201cbump stocks are gone,\u201d arguing they \u201cturn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.\u201d On Friday, Trump\u2019s campaign to return to the White House defended a Supreme Court decision to strike down his own ban on those devices. Trump has been endorsed by the NRA and claimed this year in a speech that he \u201cdid nothing\u201d to restrict guns.  The Supreme Court's ruling called new attention to Trump's complicated record on the Second Amendment, one that he has downplayed this year given his conservative base's aversion to gun control \u2014 even as Americans broadly support stricter restrictions on firearms, according to public polling.  As president, Trump grappled with the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida and other mass shootings, and at times pledged to strengthen gun laws, only to back away from those vows.  At a meeting with survivors and family members of the Parkland shooting in 2018, for instance, Trump promised to be \u201cvery strong on background checks\u201d and later scolded a Republican senator for being \u201cafraid of the NRA.\u201d He claimed he would stand up to the gun lobby and finally get results on quelling gun violence. But he later retreated after a meeting with the group, expressing support for modest changes to the federal background check system and for arming teachers, while saying in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that there was \u201cnot much political support (to put it mildly).\u201d Now, he casts himself as \u201dthe best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\" Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for his campaign, issued a statement Friday saying the court's decision \u201cshould be respected.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump has been and always will be a fierce defender of Americans\u2019 Second Amendment rights and he is proud to be endorsed by the NRA,\u201d Leavitt said.  President Joe Biden called the Trump-era ban \u201can important gun safety regulation,\u201d while the Democratic incumbent's campaign criticized Trump for nominating three of the Supreme Court justices who voted to strike down the ban.  \u201cWeapons of war have no place on the streets of America, but Trump\u2019s Supreme Court justices have decided the gun lobby is more important than the safety of our kids and our communities,\u201d said Michael Tyler, a Biden campaign spokesman. The Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration overstepped when in 2018 it banned bump stocks after a mass shooting in Las Vegas where hundreds were wounded and dozens were killed. The devices allow a rate of fire comparable to machine guns. The decision did not elicit an outpouring of response from most Republican members of Congress. That reflects the precarious situation it puts many in the GOP in as the ruling is seen as a victory for the pro-gun community despite overturning a Trump-era ban. U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie is a Kentucky Republican who has antagonized Trump and who supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 failed bid for the White House. On Friday, he posted on X that \u201cCongress makes the laws, not the administrative branch\u201d and then wrote the top court had invalidated \u201cTrump\u2019s bump-stock ban.\u201d Other Republican federal lawmakers simply called it an \u201cunconstitutional\u201d ban but did not mention Trump. The decision on Friday may gain more attention in the key Western battleground state of Nevada, where in 2017 a high-stakes gambler killed 60 people before killing himself, leaving his exact motive a mystery. A Nevada state lawmaker who was among the 22,000 concertgoers who fled the barrage of bullets in Las Vegas in October 2017 said that \u201cNo community has felt the devastating impact of bump stocks more than Nevadans.\u201d  \u201cNow more than ever, it is important to elect Democrats up and down the ballot to ensure we keep our communities safe from the epidemic of gun violence and prevent soulless, morally corrupt, and bankrupt MAGA Republicans beholden to the gun lobby from being in charge of the public safety of our communities,\u201d said assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui, a Democrat. _____ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri and Scott Sonner contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"LISA RATHKE Associated Press","title":"Vermont governor vetoes data privacy bill, saying state would be most hostile to businesses","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/vermont-governor-vetoes-data-privacy-bill-state-hostile-111129746","description":"Vermont\u2019s governor has vetoed a broad data privacy bill that would have been one of the strongest in the country to crack down on companies\u2019 use of online personal data","date":"2024-06-14T16:38:06Z","content":"Vermont\u2019s governor has vetoed a broad data privacy bill that would have been one of the strongest in the country to crack down on companies\u2019 use of online personal data Vermont\u2019s governor has vetoed a broad data privacy bill that would have been one of the strongest in the country to crack down on companies\u2019 use of online personal data by letting consumers file civil lawsuits against companies that break certain privacy rules. Republican Gov. Phil Scott said in his veto message late Thursday that the legislation would have made Vermont \u201ca national outlier and more hostile than any other state to many businesses and non-profits.\" \u201cI appreciate this provision is narrow in its impact, but it will still negatively impact mid-sized employers, and is generating significant fear and concern among many small businesses,\u201d he wrote.  The legislation would have prohibited the sale of sensitive data, such as social security and driver\u2019s license numbers, as well as financial information and health data. It also would have set meaningful limits on the amount of personal data that companies can collect and use, according to the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center based in Washington, D.C. The Democrat-controlled Legislature plans to override the governor's veto when it meets for a special session on Monday. The bill passed 139-3 in the House and a flurry of amendments were made in the final days of the session. \u201cOur collective efforts brought forth legislation that not only reflects our commitment to consumer protection from scams and identity theft but also sets a standard for the nation,\u201d House Speaker Jill Krowinski, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cIt is unfortunate that so much misinformation has been spread about this bill, but we know that Big Tech and their deep pockets are fearful of no longer having unrestricted access to Vermonters\u2019 personal information.\u201d More than a dozen states have comprehensive data privacy laws. When the Vermont legislature passed the bill, Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of EPIC, said the legislation was \"among the strongest, if not the strongest\u201d in the country. EPIC is urging the Legislature to override the governor's veto.  \u201cThe Vermont Data Privacy Act would have provided Vermonters with meaningful privacy rights that are lacking from other state laws, and would have rightly provided them with the opportunity to enforce those rights,\" Fitzgerald said in a statement. Scott said he also had concerns about the provision aimed at protecting children, saying that similar legislation in California \u201chas already been stopped by the courts for likely First Amendment violations\" and the state should await the outcome of that case.  The Vermont Kids Code Coalition said the legislation is different than California\u2019s and is constitutionally sound.  Much of the legislation would have gone into effect in 2025.

How else will you check Google Maps to find your Airbnb, post an Instagram video from the Eiffel Tower, or WhatsApp friends and family back home?  Of course, if you're using apps that gobble up data while traveling in a foreign country, there's always a risk of racking up hefty roaming fees from your phone carrier. The solution? An international travel eSIM for your smartphone.  How do you use this technology? Here are some tips.  If you've ever bought a new cellphone, you're probably familiar with the SIM card. Short for subscriber identity module, the SIM is a little chip the size of a fingernail that fits into a slot on most phones. Without it, you couldn't get cell service because it contains your account information and phone number.  But physical SIM cards are slowly being replaced by eSIMs \u2014 the e stands for embedded \u2014 built into newer phones. These digital versions do the same thing and can make life easier, though people used to physical SIMs might find them confusing at first.  They make switching cell carriers easier. And if you've bought a new phone recently, you might not even have a choice: Apple got rid of the SIM card tray starting with the iPhone 14 released in September 2022. They're especially beneficial for travelers. If you've got a compatible cellphone, you can add an eSIM from a virtual carrier that has better data roaming rates than your home network. Many phones will allow you to add more than one eSIM, making it easy to switch back and forth, or \u2014 for phones with the capability \u2014 use two at the same time.  Think of the convenience: Gone are the days of arriving in a strange country after a long flight, looking for a local phone company's airport kiosk, carefully popping open the SIM tray with a pin to swap in the new chip, and trying not to lose the existing one.  The eSIM market is booming. Kester Mann, director of consumer research at CCS Insight, says there are dozens of providers that can be found online, with names like Nomad, Holafly, Easysim, Airhub and Airalo.  \u201cThese guys have a role to play because I think they offer a very affordable and attractive opportunity for international travelers,\u201d Mann said.  The boom means there's plenty of competition keeping rates low. Prices are typically clearly displayed online, either through a menu of packages on the provider's website or a calculator based on the amount of data needed and trip length.  Some 800 carriers support eSIMs, according to CCS, so international coverage is extensive. Many eSIM providers offer packages based on country or region, so you can check which ones have good rates for the place you'll be visiting and sign up in advance. Traveling to Europe and need data for a month covering 30 countries? Airalo offers, for example, 10 gigabytes at $37 while Holafly's package has unlimited data for 69 euros ($75).  For an upcoming trip to Prague, I bought 5 gigabytes of data for just $5 from Global Yo. I was slightly put off by some negative reviews professing problems buying, installing or activating the company's eSIMs, but I didn't have any problems myself.  You'll need a phone that's unlocked for use with different wireless carriers.  If you're not setting up a new phone, the typical activation method is with a QR code, or a more conventional string of numbers and letters. If you're planning a trip and buy one before you leave, it's a good idea to print out the code if you don't want to activate right away.  For iPhones, go to your Settings menu, then to either the Cellular or Mobile Service section, then tap Add eSIM. You'll be prompted to scan the code, or manually enter it. The process is similar for Android users. Samsung has a guide for Galaxy devices, and Google has a help page for Pixel users, while eSIM carriers have step-by-step instructions. Apple has a YouTube video, as well as tip sheets on using eSIMs for international travel and on using two eSIMs simultaneously.  If you've got a phone that supports dual eSIMs, you \u201ccan pick potentially the best network based on price and or coverage\" while traveling, said Mann.  Some carriers have their own apps to manage eSIMs and track data usage.  More than 200 devices support the technology, CCS Insight says. U.K. phone company Vodafone has a list of compatible devices. Or dial (asterisk)#06# \u2014 an EID code indicates it's compatible.  For iPhone users, it's any model released since the XS, XS Max or XR, as well as recent iPads. They're compatible with any Samsung Galaxy devices released since 2020, and Google Pixel 4 and newer models will work; some Pixel 3 devices also support them.  First check your own carrier\u2019s roaming costs for the places you\u2019re visiting. Sometimes it\u2019s not worth it. \u201cRoaming costs these days are far lower and less prohibitive than they once were,\u201d said Mann. They\u2019ve even been abolished for European Union residents crossing the 27-nation bloc\u2019s internal borders. But travelers in Britain, which has left the EU, are facing them again for travel to the continent.  ___ Is there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

The European Union's executive branch took the decision targeting Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat under its trailblazing Digital Services Act, or DSA, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. Facing fines, the companies must provide information by July 4. Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat have been classed as \u201cvery large online platforms\u201d subject to more stringent controls under the DSA because they each have 45 million average monthly users. \u201cThe Commission is requesting the companies to provide more detailed information on the measures they have taken to diligently assess and mitigate risks related to the protection of minors online, as well as to prevent the amplification of illegal content and gender-based violence,\u201d the European Commission said on Thursday. The EU wants to find out what kind of safeguards have been implemented to guarantee that viewers are not underage. On most pornographic platforms, a mere click on a \u201cyes\u201d box saying the user is age 18 or over is enough to enter. The European Commission is also asking the companies to explain how they have adapted their internal organization to comply with the DSA.  \u201cThe DSA indeed requires designated very large online platforms to equip themselves with independent and well-resourced internal teams with sufficient authority and resources, as well as access to the management body,\u201d the European Commission said. Pornhub last year disputed its status as a very large online platform under the DSA, referring to a statement on its website saying it has 33 million average monthly users. France, Germany and Britain and U.S. states, including Utah and Texas, have drafted laws requiring porn sites to verify a user is 18 or older. Methods could include checking credit cards or government-issued ID or scanning faces to estimate ages, but all those systems have raised concerns about privacy and discrimination. Europe\u2019s digital law also calls for measures to curb the risk of spreading illegal content online, such as child sexual abuse material, or content that breaches \u201cfundamental rights\u201d like privacy, such as \u201cnonconsensual\u201d images or deepfake porn. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"SETH BORENSTEIN AP science writer","title":"Bye bye, El Nino.

It's cool flip side, La Nina, is likely to breeze in just in time for peak Atlantic hurricane season, federal meteorologists said. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Thursday pronounced dead the El Nino that warms parts of the central Pacific. The El Nino, while not quite a record breaker in strength, formed a year ago has been blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather.  The world is now in a neutral condition when it comes to the important natural El Nino Southern Oscillation, which warps weather systems worldwide. Neutral is when weather gets closer to long-term averages or normal, something that hasn't happened as much recently as it used to, said NOAA physical scientist Michelle L\u2019Heureux, who is the lead forecaster of the agency\u2019s ENSO team. But it likely won't last, she added. She said there's a 65% chance that a La Nina, a cooling of the same parts of the Pacific that often has opposite effects, will form in the July, August and September time period. One of the biggest effects of La Nina is that it tends to make Atlantic hurricane season more active, and that storm season starts its peak in August. \u201cThe likelihood of a La Nina coupled with record warm sea surface temperatures is the reason the National Hurricane Center is forecasting an extraordinary hurricane season,\u201d said Kathie Dello, North Carolina's state climatologist. \u201cStates from Texas to Maine are making preparations for an active year.\u201d Both El Nino and La Nina create \u201cpotential hot spots\u201d for extreme weather but in different places and of different types, L'Heureux said. \u201cLa Nina tends to, in the winter, bring drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and if you put global warming on top of that, that could also mean those drier conditions could intensify into droughts,\u201d L'Heureux said. That's because storm systems, mostly in the winter, move slightly northward with a shift in the jet stream during La Nina years, bringing more rain and snow north, L'Heureux said. Even though a La Nina tends to be cooler, there will likely be a residual effect of the exiting El Nino on global temperatures, L\u2019Heureux said. This year has seen each month breaking global records so far.  No more than 8% of last year's record heat could be attributed to El Nino and other natural variability, a panel of 57 scientists concluded earlier this month. The rest was from human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. A 1999 economic study found that drought from La Nina cost the United States agriculture between $2.2 billion to $6.5 billion, which is far more than the $1.5 billion cost of El Nino. A neutral ENSO is best for agriculture. Given La Nina's connection to Atlantic hurricanes and drought in the United States it makes sense that they are generally costlier, but every El Nino and La Nina is different, so people and governments should prepare for them, said meteorologist and economist Michael Ferrari, chief scientific officer of AlphaGeo, a firm that works on financial investments and climate. The El Nino that just ended \u201cwasn't a record-breaker in anybody's book, but it was probably about top five,\u201d L'Heureux said. And it added to overall global temperature and brought more moisture to the southern United States this year, along with drier conditions in parts of South America and Central America, she said. The Horn of Africa got wetter. Coral reef experts say the combination of record ocean temperatures and the boost of heating from El Nino have led to a major global bleaching event threatening and at times killing vulnerable coral. Before this year\u2019s El Nino, the world had back-to-back-to-back La Ninas, which is unusual, L\u2019Heureux said. Some studies have shown that the globe should expect more El Ninos and La Ninas \u2014 and fewer neutrals \u2014 as the world warms, but it\u2019s still an unsettled issue, she said. ___ Read more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http:\/\/www.apnews.com\/climate-and-environment ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears ______ The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Paul Nakasone was the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and the director of the National Security Agency before stepping down earlier this year.  He joins an OpenAI board of directors that's still picking up new members after upheaval at the San Francisco artificial intelligence company forced a reset of the board's leadership last year. The previous board had abruptly fired CEO Sam Altman and then was itself replaced as he returned to his CEO role days later.  OpenAI reinstated Altman to its board of directors in March and said it had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his leadership after the conclusion of an outside investigation into the company\u2019s turmoil. OpenAI's board is technically a nonprofit but also governs its rapidly growing business. Nakasone is also joining OpenAI's new safety and security committee \u2014 a group that's supposed to advise the full board on \u201ccritical safety and security decisions\u201d for its projects and operations. The safety group replaced an earlier safety team that was disbanded after several of its leaders quit.

A spokesperson for Computershare, the company hosting the webcast, confirmed that \u201cunprecedented demand\" from shareholders looking to access the meeting led to a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d that prevented some from getting through. The meeting was then adjourned. \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry that this happened and are working with our supplier to ensure that it does not happen again,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement sent to The Associated Press Thursday afternoon. The meeting was originally slated to begin at 11 a.m. ET. Around that time, those attempting to use the link found that it wouldn\u2019t load or received an error message. According to social media accounts of those who appeared to make it on the call, Gamestop briefly cited \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d before adjourning the meeting. It was not immediately clear when the event would be rescheduled. The Grapevine, Texas-based video game retailer did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday. Despite the fumble, Gamestop's shares were still up for than 6% by Thursday afternoon. At the center of the meme stock craze, Gamestop saw a resurgence last month after Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d returned online for the first time in three years.  All eyes have been on whether Gamestop can make a comeback. Roaring Kitty recently took to YouTube on Friday, to tell his hordes of followers that he still believes GameStop\u2019s management team can turn the struggling company around following a disappointing earnings report. There's a long way to go. Gamestop managed to narrow its losses in the first quarter, but its revenue fell as sales weakened for hardware and accessories, software and collectibles. GameStop also filed paperwork with securities regulators to sell up to 75 million shares of stock. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"MATT O'BRIEN AND SARAH PARVINI AP technology writers","title":"AI startup Perplexity wants to upend search business.

But its AI-driven search chatbot is already facing challenges as some news media companies object to its business practices. It is also competing against t ech giants Google, and now Apple, which are increasingly fusing similar AI features into their core products. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has spent much of the past week defending the company after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story but without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission. Forbes said it later found similar \u201cknock-off\u201d stories lifted from other publications. The Associated Press separately found another Perplexity product feature inventing fake quotes from real people, including a former elected town official from Martha\u2019s Vineyard falsely quoted to say he didn\u2019t want the Massachusetts island to become a destination for marijuana. \u201cI never said that,\u201d said Bill Rossi, a former member of the island town of Chilmark\u2019s select board. Srinivas told The Associated Press that his company is trying to build positive relationships with news publishers that ensure their news content \u201creaches more people.\u201d \u201cWe can definitely coexist and help each other,\u201d he said. Asked about Forbes, he said his product \u201cnever ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else\u2019s content,\u201d in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies\u2019 AI systems generate. \u201cWe are actually more of an aggregator of information and providing it to the people with the right attribution,\u201d Srinivas said. But, he added, \u201cIt was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source. We took that feedback immediately and updated changes that day itself. And now the sources are more prominently highlighted.\u201d Perplexity also revealed this week that it has been seeking revenue-sharing partnerships that would pay news publishers a portion of Perplexity\u2019s advertising revenue each time an outlet\u2019s news content is referenced as a source. Randall Lane, chief content officer of Forbes Media, called the dispute an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the conversation about AI. \u201cIt\u2019s a case study in where we\u2019re heading,\u201d Lane told the AP. \u201cIf the people who are leading the charge don\u2019t have a fundamental respect for the hard work of doing proprietary reporting, and keeping people informed with value-added content, we\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d A self-described \u201cAI bull\u201d who believes that the technology could help make many news organizations more efficient, Lane said the dispute between Perplexity and Forbes is important because it is a \u201cmetaphor for what can happen if the people controlling the AI don\u2019t respect the people doing the work.\u201d Perplexity bills itself as a search engine while \u201cacting like a media company and publishing a story\u201d that only Forbes had reported, Lane said. \u201cThe whole thing was very disingenuous. And what we didn\u2019t hear was, \u2018Oops, yeah we messed that one up and we need to do better,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it was just putting out more content, little tweaks to the model and treating journalism like it\u2019s just a commodity to be manufactured.\u201d Srinivas, a computer scientist and former AI researcher at OpenAI and Google, co-founded Perplexity in the summer of 2022, not long before the AI image-generator Stable Diffusion and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT began sparking the public's fascination with the possibilities of generative AI. Inspired, in part, by his childhood love of Wikipedia, he described Perplexity to the AP as \u201clike a marriage of Wikipedia and ChatGPT\u201d that can instantly answer a person\u2019s questions without the \u201chuge cluttered mess\u201d of Google\u2019s conventional search results. \u201cYou ask a question, you get an answer with clean sources, and there\u2019s like three or four suggested (follow-up) questions and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said of Perplexity. \u201cThat way people\u2019s minds can be free from distractions, and they can just focus on learning and digging deeper.\u201d The company sells a subscription for premium features and is planning to start an advertising-based service as it grows its user base. \u201cWe are not profitable as a company today, but we are also more sustainably run than foundation model companies because we do not train our own foundation models,\u201d which requires huge amounts of computing power, he said. Perplexity relies on existing AI large language models such as those built by OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook; and then \u201cpost-trains\u201d them. \u201cWe shape them to be really good summarizers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not always clear where the summarized information is coming from. One Perplexity feature called Writing \u2014 which enables a user to \u201cgenerate text or chat without searching the web\u201d \u2014 produces lengthy and unsourced commentary, often in the style of a news article. Tests of the feature by an AP reporter asking it to write about the lack of marijuana on Martha\u2019s Vineyard led it to produce a 465-word document that resembled a news article and included fabricated quotations from the former town official and another real person. The AP is not repeating the false quotes in order to avoid perpetuating misinformation. Srinivas said that the Writing feature of Perplexity is a \u201cminor use case\u201d that was intended for helping to compose essays or correcting grammar when primary source information isn\u2019t needed. He said it's \u201cmore prone to hallucinations\u201d \u2014 a common problem with AI large language models \u2014 because it isn't tethered to the web search capabilities of Perplexity's core product. \u201cThere is no doubt that generative AI is upending journalism, content creation, and search,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute. She pointed to Google\u2019s new, Perplexity-like approach that summarizes answers based on information pulled from crawling the web, as an example. That, too, led to false information and forced Google to make adjustments to the product after its public release. \u201cBut their whole model of advertising is based on sending people to websites,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhy will people go to websites if they can have the one-stop-shop of the answer in the AI output?\u201d Srinivas claimed to the AP that \u201ca lot of people get referrals from Perplexity, and I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re getting referrals from a new player in the internet.\" For now, much of that benefit may be aspirational. Perplexity\u2019s worldwide user base has grown rapidly this year to more than 85 million web visits in May, but that barely registers compared to the billions of users of ChatGPT and other popular platforms from Microsoft and Google, according to data from Similarweb. The debate demonstrates the \u201cuncertain and challenging times\u201d for online content creators in general and journalism in particular because aggregators only work if publications such as Forbes exist, said Stephen Lind, an associate professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. Using AI as a synthesizing tool works for widespread dissemination of information until \u201cyou run out of originals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are whole companies or whole applications that are also doing this, where they are rolling out new services without fully thinking through the implications or best practices or safeguards because they\u2019re rolling out applications for industries that maybe they\u2019re not native to,\u201d he said. Lind said it\u2019s good that companies like Perplexity are \u201ctaking at least some steps to course correct when an industry or a user pushes back.\u201d But some of the changes should have been baked in from the beginning, he added. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"A week of disorder in Cleveland, as City Hall remains closed after cyber threat","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/wireStory\/week-disorder-cleveland-city-hall-remains-closed-after-111133776","description":"Cleveland\u2019s City Hall remained closed to the public Friday, as officials in Ohio\u2019s second-largest city continued to grapple with the effects of a cyber threat","date":"2024-06-14T18:14:01Z","content":"Cleveland\u2019s City Hall will remained closed to the public through at least Monday, as officials in Ohio\u2019s second-largest city continued to grapple with the effects of a ransomware attack CLEVELAND -- Cleveland's City Hall remained closed to the public Friday, as officials in Ohio's second-largest city continued to grapple with the effects of a ransomware attack.

Its sister award, the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction, went to U.S. writer V. V. Ganeshananthan for her novel \u201cBrotherless Night,\u201d about a family torn apart by Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war. Both come with 30,000 pounds ($38,000) in prize money. Both winners referenced the conflict-clouded international situation, at a time when the arts world is grappling with divisions over the Israel-Hamas war and corporate sponsorship of the arts. Klein, author of \u201cNo Logo\u201d and \u201cThe Shock Doctrine,\u201d delves into her experience being mistaken for Naomi Wolf, author of \u201cThe Beauty Myth\u201d and more recently a promulgator of anti-vaxx ideas and other conspiracy theories. Part memoir and part reportage, \u201cDoppelganger\u201d \u2014 subtitled \u201cA Trip into the Mirror World\u201d \u2014 investigates how online life has distorted reality, and asks what might be done about it. Historian Suzannah Lipscomb, who headed a panel of judges for the nonfiction award, called Klein\u2019s book \u201ca courageous, humane and optimistic call-to-arms that moves us beyond black and white, beyond Right and Left.\u201d Klein thanked the prize for \u201cnot shying away from controversy.\u201d She has backed calls for book festivals to stop taking money from companies with investments in fossil fuels or Israel\u2019s defense sector, a campaign that has led to U.K. events cancelling funding from finance firm Baillie Gifford.

She said writing historical fiction \u201ccarefully and thoughtfully\u201d about a traumatic conflict well within living memory that was true to people\u2019s experience was \u201chard work.\u201d \u201cIt took such a long time because of the chorus of people it was necessary to talk to,\u201d she said.

The June 25 derailment at the Grona Lund park in Stockholm \u201cwas caused by deficiencies in the ordering, manufacturing and testing of new support arms for the Jetline trains,\" the Swedish Accident Investigation Authority said. It said the support arms weren't sufficiently strong. The roller coaster was carrying 11 passengers at the time of the derailment. The front of the train jumped off the tracks, leaving one car tilted toward the ground. A woman in her 30s was thrown out of the ride and died. Two others also fell from the train, one of whom was seriously injured and the other received minor injuries. Seven other passengers also had minor injuries.

The European Union's executive branch took the decision targeting Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat under its trailblazing Digital Services Act, or DSA, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. Facing fines, the companies must provide information by July 4. Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat have been classed as \u201cvery large online platforms\u201d subject to more stringent controls under the DSA because they each have 45 million average monthly users. \u201cThe Commission is requesting the companies to provide more detailed information on the measures they have taken to diligently assess and mitigate risks related to the protection of minors online, as well as to prevent the amplification of illegal content and gender-based violence,\u201d the European Commission said on Thursday. The EU wants to find out what kind of safeguards have been implemented to guarantee that viewers are not underage. On most pornographic platforms, a mere click on a \u201cyes\u201d box saying the user is age 18 or over is enough to enter. The European Commission is also asking the companies to explain how they have adapted their internal organization to comply with the DSA.  \u201cThe DSA indeed requires designated very large online platforms to equip themselves with independent and well-resourced internal teams with sufficient authority and resources, as well as access to the management body,\u201d the European Commission said. Pornhub last year disputed its status as a very large online platform under the DSA, referring to a statement on its website saying it has 33 million average monthly users. France, Germany and Britain and U.S. states, including Utah and Texas, have drafted laws requiring porn sites to verify a user is 18 or older. Methods could include checking credit cards or government-issued ID or scanning faces to estimate ages, but all those systems have raised concerns about privacy and discrimination.

At the end of a four-day inquiry into the accident outside RAF Croughton, an air base in eastern England that is used by U.S. forces, Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember recorded the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn as being as a result of \u201cinjuries sustained during a head-on collision\u201d with a car being driven on the wrong side of the road.  Unlike in the United States, drivers in the U.K. drive on the left-hand side of the road.  In a statement that was read at the inquest, the driver, Anne Sacoolas, had admitted to police that she \u201cdrove like an American\u201d and that she had not received any training about driving in the U.K.  Sacoolas, who told police that she worked as an analyst for the U.S. State Department, declined to make the journey to the U.K. from the U.S. for the inquest. \u201cI made a tragic mistake that I will live with every single day for the rest of my life,\" she said in a written statement to the inquiry. \"There is not a single day that goes by that Harry is not on my mind and I am deeply sorry for the pain that I have caused.\u201d Sacoolas and her husband, an American intelligence officer, returned to the U.S. 19 days after the accident. The U.S. government had invoked diplomatic immunity on her behalf, prompting an outcry in Britain. Sacoolas pleaded guilty by video link of causing death by careless driving in Dec. 2022 at London\u2019s Central Criminal Court after being advised by the U.S. administration against making the trip. She was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for a year, with the judge in the case reducing the penalty because of Sacoolas\u2019 guilty plea and previous good character.

Li, China\u2019s No. 2 official, is the first Chinese premier to visit New Zealand since a 2017 visit by Li Keqiang. He will also travel to Australia and Malaysia, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said this week. The trip coincides with easing tensions between Australia and China that have vexed the relationship in recent years. After their meeting, Luxon and Li announced new agreements on trade, environmental and other issues. China is the South Pacific nation\u2019s largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth 36 billion New Zealand dollars ($22 billion). They signed a bilateral free trade agreement in 2008 \u2014 China\u2019s first with an Organization for Cooperation and Development nation \u2014 and Li's visit marked the 10th anniversary of a pledge to bolster ties signed in 2014 when China\u2019s President Xi Jinping last visited Wellington. New Zealand has long sought to diversify its export market away from dependence on China, but Luxon on Thursday hailed Li's visit as a renewed opportunity for business, adding there were \u201chuge\u201d opportunities for more trade, citing China\u2019s \u201crapidly rising middle class.\u201d Wellington in recent years has struck a more moderate tone with Beijing on security matters than many of its Western partners \u2014 including the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada \u2014 and has sought a consistent foreign policy approach to Beijing that spans political parties and administrations. That has often prompted milder remarks from New Zealand on Chinese human rights or security issues than its allies, but Luxon said Thursday the countries' \u201clongstanding\u201d relationship permitted disagreement. \u201cThe ability to be able to talk very directly and very upfront about issues that we might disagree on, have differences of opinions around, is actually a very good thing,\u201d Luxon said. \u201cIt might be uncomfortable at times for both parties, but at least we\u2019re actually able to do that.\u201d Li, too, affirmed the two countries\u2019 willingness to diverge. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that we don\u2019t always agree with each other on everything,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut I think differences should not become a chasm that blocks our exchanges and communication. Instead, it should be a driving force for us to learn from each other and help each other develop.\u201d The countries were \u201cgood friends,\u201d Li added. Luxon, when asked by reporters how much of his meeting with Li had covered common ground and how much concerned the countries\u2019 differences, replied: \u201cProbably 50-50.\u201d Luxon said he told the Chinese premier he would have \u201cno tolerance\u201d for foreign interference in New Zealand\u2019s affairs. Luxon said Li had raised concern about Wellington\u2019s possible participation in a trilateral security pact with Australia, the United States and Britain known as AUKUS. Li arrived in New Zealand's capital to a mostly warm public welcome, with supporters who lined the streets in the capital far outnumbering protesters denouncing China\u2019s human rights record. Asked by reporters whether China was a good citizen in the global community, Luxon stopped short. \u201cIt\u2019s an important one,\u201d he said. Li\u2019s upcoming visit to Canberra will cap two years of efforts to rebuild China-Australia relations after a period of intense challenges, including over regional security and human rights. It will mark the first visit there by a Chinese premier in seven years, and follows Albanese\u2019s trip to Beijing last November and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u2019s trip to Australia and New Zealand in March. China has been steadily rolling back tariffs and other restrictions it placed on imports from Australia as relations soured in 2020. China opposes to Australia\u2019s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines with assistance from the U.S. and the U.K., which it sees as part of American efforts to constrain China by deepening military ties with other countries in the region. But with Australia unlikely to bend on that issue, Li\u2019s focus will likely be on moving past their differences and deepening economic ties. Australia, which has a trade surplus with China, is a major supplier of iron ore and other minerals to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. ___ Associated Press journalist Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"PAOLO SANTALUCIA Associated Press, COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press","title":"Italy's G7 venue is a faux medieval luxury resort far from public view","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/italys-g7-venue-faux-medieval-luxury-resort-public-111088331","description":"Leaders of the Group of Seven rich democracies are meeting in a faux medieval town constructed as a luxury resort on the heel of Italy\u2019s boot","date":"2024-06-13T12:54:32Z","content":"Leaders of the Group of Seven rich democracies are meeting in a faux medieval town constructed as a luxury resort on the heel of Italy\u2019s boot BORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- Leaders of the Group of Seven rich democracies are meeting in a faux medieval town constructed as a luxury resort on the heel of Italy\u2019s boot. Borgo Egnazia, nestled amid olive groves and prickly pear cacti in the southern Puglia region, has reportedly hosted Madonna and the Beckhams. Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake got married there. On Thursday, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni waited near the arched entrance and in front of one of Puglia's famed olive trees to greet the other G7 leaders. The summit venues have been located far from population centers since police clashed with anti-globalization protesters at the 2001 G8 summit in the northern port city of Genoa. This time, the main press center is in the city of Bari, in a different province two hours away with security checks. Located next to an archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets of pink-hued cobblestones, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clock tower \u2014 but has no mayor or postal code. The borgo, or Italian for village, is constructed out of Lecce stone, a unique limestone called the \u201cmarble of the poor,\u201d giving it the same gold and cream glint of the Baroque center of nearby Lecce. The meandering streets are so convincing that visitors have reported having trouble finding their way back from the breakfast dining room. But this is no medieval town. It was built in 2010, helping to drive Puglia's tourism boom thanks in part to its 18-hole golf course, which overlooks the Adriatic sea. Anyone wishing to visit the venue after the leaders leave can book a superior double, with breakfast included, starting at 1,230 euros a night, according to aggregator sites. Guests enjoy two swimming pools, a spa and wellness center as well as three tennis courts. A private beach club is reserved for the resort in Savelletri, 1.5 kilometers (a mile) away. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"UK Labour leader Keir Starmer says he'll end the era of 'gestures and gimmicks' if he wins power","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/uk-labour-leader-keir-starmer-hell-end-era-111085822","description":"The left-of-center politician aiming to become Britain\u2019s prime minister in three weeks\u2019 time is promising to lead a government that\u2019s both \u201cpro-business and pro-worker\u201d and restore stability after years of economic and political turmoil","date":"2024-06-13T11:50:25Z","content":"The left-of-center politician aiming to become Britain\u2019s prime minister in three weeks\u2019 time is promising to lead a government that\u2019s both \u201cpro-business and pro-worker\u201d and restore stability after years of economic and political turmoil MANCHESTER, England -- The left-of-center politician aiming to become Britain\u2019s prime minister in three weeks\u2019 time said Thursday he will lead a government that\u2019s both \u201cpro-business and pro-worker\u201d and restore stability after years of economic and political turmoil. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said that if he\u2019s elected on July 4, he will end the \u201cdesperate era of gestures and gimmicks\u201d of the Conservative Party\u2019s turbulent tenure. Launching Labour\u2019s election manifesto in the northwest England city of Manchester, Starmer said a Labour government would \u201cstop the chaos, turn the page and start to rebuild our country.\u201d Next month British voters will elect lawmakers to fill all 650 seats in the House of Commons, and the leader of the party that can command a majority \u2014 either alone or in coalition \u2014 will become prime minister. Labour currently has a double-digit lead in opinion polls over Prime Minister Rishi Sunak \u2019s governing Conservatives, who have been in power for 14 years under five different prime ministers.  The Conservatives jettisoned two prime ministers without an election in quick succession in 2022: first Boris Johnson, felled by scandals, then Liz Truss, who rocked the economy with drastic tax-slashing plans and lasted just seven weeks in office. Starmer, a former chief prosecutor who is widely seen as competent but dull, is trying to turn his stolid image into an asset. His core message is that he has transformed Labour from its high-taxing, big-spending days under former leader Jeremy Corbyn into a party of the stable center. Starmer said his platform was \u201ca manifesto for wealth creation,\u201d and acknowledged that a Labour government would face \u201chard choices\u201d about public spending. \u201cWe cannot play fast and loose with the public finances,\u201d he said. He said he rejected the idea that \u201cthe only levers are tax and spend,\u201d and would get the economy expanding after years of sluggish growth. Starmer\u2019s cautious economic approach dismays some in his party, who want bolder change, but has won the support of many business leaders. Starmer called the party's platform a manifesto for \u201cwealth creation,\u201d and its ambitious goals were largely long-term ones: establishing a new industrial policy, developing a 10-year infrastructure strategy, building 1.5 million new homes. Labour pledged to improve ties with Britain\u2019s former partners in the European Union, but ruled out a return to the bloc\u2019s frictionless single market and customs union. The plan's spending commitments were modest. The manifesto forecasts that taxes will rise by 7.4 billion pounds ($9.25 billion) by 2028-29, through measures including by closing loopholes related to the recent abolition of the \u201cnon-domiciled\u201d tax status, which has allowed some wealthy individuals to avoid paying U.K. taxes. The party is also planning to extend a windfall tax on energy companies.  Starmer said personal taxes would not rise under a Labour government, but that did not stop the Conservatives casting Labour as the high-tax party. \u201cIf you think they\u2019ll win, start saving,\u201d Sunak wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Starmer spoke at the headquarters of the Co-op, a Manchester-founded cooperative society that has grown into a large retail and services empire. He introduced several voters, including a father whose family of four live in a one-bedroom apartment, and Nathaniel Dye, a man with terminal cancer campaigning for faster treatment. The only unscripted moment came from a demonstrator calling for Labour to have tougher climate change policies, who was swiftly removed. Sunak released the Conservative manifesto \u2014 the party's key handbook of promises \u2014 on Tuesday, pledging to cut taxes and reduce immigration if the Conservative Party is reelected. Labour's 131-page manifesto included previously announced plans, with little in the way of last-minute treats to woo voters. \u201cIt\u2019s not about rabbits out of a hat, it's not about pantomime,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI\u2019m running as a candidate to be prime minister, not a candidate to run the circus.\u201d ___ Lawless reported from London.

The health ministry said Thursday that a 38-year-old man died in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province on Wednesday, the same day a laboratory test confirmed that he had contracted the virus. Another man died Monday in a hospital near Johannesburg, the ministry said. Health Minister Joe Phaahla said the two deaths were among six recent confirmed cases of mpox in South Africa, all of them in men in their 30s. Some had multiple sexual partners, including men and women. Genetic tests for the first three cases showed the men had the less severe version of mpox, which spread globally in an outbreak that began in 2022. In all cases, the men had no travel history to countries currently experiencing an outbreak, \"which suggests there is local transmission of this infectious disease,\u201d Phaahla said. He said the six men had underlying conditions. The latest man to die had HIV. Mpox is known to be more deadly in people with other health conditions, particularly those that weaken their immune systems. Mpox, also known as monkeypox, is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is common to other parts of Africa, where people are often infected through bites from rodents or other small animals. Mpox was not known to spread easily among people until 2022, when authorities detected epidemics in Europe, North America and elsewhere and the World Health Organization declared it a global emergency. That epidemic also marked the first time that mpox was seen to spread via sex; the majority of people affected were gay or bisexual men. The U.N. health agency said last year mpox was no longer an international crisis. WHO reported last month that there had been 186 mpox deaths worldwide since 2022, with a fatality rate of less than 1%. South Africa last recorded an mpox case in 2022, Phaahla said. He said South Africa doesn't have any vaccines but was considering obtaining doses and rolling out an immunization campaign. Phaahla said the outbreak in South Africa is distinct from the ongoing epidemic in Congo, where a more lethal form of the disease might be fueling the country's biggest-ever outbreak. ___ AP Africa news: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/africa 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"NAYARA BATSCHKE Associated Press","title":"Storms in Chile damage homes, flood roads and leave at least 1 person dead","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/storms-chile-damage-homes-flood-roads-leave-1-111111989","description":"Heavy rains lashed much of Chile, damaging homes, flooding roads, knocking out power and causing mudslides that have swept through residential areas","date":"2024-06-14T00:34:49Z","content":"Heavy rains lashed much of Chile, damaging homes, flooding roads, knocking out power and causing mudslides that have swept through residential areas SANTIAGO, Chile -- Heavy rains lashed much of Chile on Thursday, damaging homes, flooding roads, knocking out power and causing mudslides that have swept through residential areas.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government didn\u2019t want Russia involved. But the Swiss insist that Russia must be involved at some point, and hope it will join the process one day. The conference on Saturday and Sunday, underpinned by elements of a 10-point peace formula presented by Zelenskyy in late 2022, is seen as a largely symbolic effort on the part of Kyiv to rally the international community and project strength against Russian might.  But the question looming over the summit will be how the two countries can eventually end the war without Moscow attending.  The conflict has also led to international sanctions against nuclear-armed Russia and raised tensions between NATO and Moscow. The summit comes as Russian forces have been making modest territorial gains in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Here\u2019s a look at what to expect from the weekend gathering at the Buergenstock Resort on a cliff overlooking Lake Lucerne. Among the stakes will be simple optics: How many countries the Swiss and Ukrainians can draw in. Swiss officials sent out around 160 invitations. About 90 delegations, including a handful of international organizations like the United Nations, will attend. Roughly half will be from Europe. Zelenskyy led a diplomatic push in Asia and beyond to rally participation. Several dozen attendees will be heads of state or government, including from France, Poland, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting Zelenskyy on Saturday on the sidelines of the summit, and she's also expected to deliver an address. U.S. President Joe Biden, who was wrapping up a visit to Italy on Friday for a Group of Seven summit, opted to dispatch Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Biden and Zelenskyy signed a 10-year security agreement Thursday at the G7 summit. Russia's key ally China won't attend. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has said it believes a peace conference should involve both Russia and Ukraine. The final list of attendees isn\u2019t expected until late Friday, and question marks remain about how key developing countries like India, Brazil and Turkey might take part, if at all.  But so far, under half of the 193 U.N. member countries are planning to attend, testifying to a wait-and-see attitude in many capitals.  \u201cRussia does not have a lot of allies in this particular situation,\" said Keith Krause, a professor of international security studies at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. \u201cIt has a number of states that are susceptible to being pressured, and a few that actually wish to stand aside, from what they see as a northern, U.S.-Russia, NATO-Russia confrontation.\u201d Naysayers say the conference will be short on substantial achievements. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government doesn\u2019t believe Switzerland, which has lined up behind European Union sanctions on Moscow over the war, is neutral.  Putin said Friday that \u201cwithout Russia\u2019s participation, without an honest and responsible dialogue with us, it is impossible to reach a peaceful solution in Ukraine and in general regarding global and European security.\u201d He suggested that the conference is \u201djust another ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention.\" Participants are expected to unite around an outcome document or a joint plan, and Ukraine will have a lot of input. But ironing out language that delegations can agree upon is still a work in progress. Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, said that Ukrainian officials wanted countries that respect Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity to be invited. He said the basis of the talks should be a 10-point peace formula that Zelenskyy has presented. Yermak said Tuesday that Ukraine and the other participants would be preparing a \u201cjoint plan\u201d to unite around, \"and we\u2019re looking for the possibility in the second summit to invite representative of Russia, and together present this joint plan.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s peace plan launched by Zelenskyy outlines 10 proposals that encapsulate the president\u2019s step-by-step vision to end the full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022. The plan includes ambitious calls, including the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory, the cessation of hostilities and restoring Ukraine\u2019s state borders with Russia, including Crimea.  But Ukraine is unable to negotiate from a position of strength. Moscow\u2019s army has the upper hand in firepower and number of troops, while Kyiv\u2019s momentum has been stalled by delays in Western military supplies.  That is likely why the most contentious elements of the plan aren't being discussed. Only three themes will be on the table: nuclear safety, including at the Russia-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, humanitarian aid and global food security. Western officials in Kyiv said these themes cut across international interests and are easy for Kyiv to rally the international community around. But they don't encompass the tougher issues that can only be resolved with Moscow as a negotiating partner. Russia\u2019s hesitancy about the conference stems in part from its unwillingness to show any sign of acceptance of the Ukrainian peace formula. Putin has espoused a deal to be premised on a draft peace agreement negotiated in the early days of the war that included provisions for Ukraine\u2019s neutral status and put limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks on the status of Russia-occupied areas. Krause, of the Graduate Institute, said that Ukraine needs to emerge from the conference with momentum and renewed commitment from allies on issues like territorial integrity and future relationships \u2014 even if NATO and EU membership may be far off. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is particularly deluded that this is going to give birth to a new peace plan, or even to some kind of agreement that stops the hostilities on the battlefield,\" Krause said. \"But as past wars have shown, including as far back as World War II, discussions about the contours of the peace begin long before the fighting stops on the battlefield.\u201d ___ Samya Kullab in Kyiv, Ukraine, Aamer Madhani in Washington, and Jim Heintz in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Putin promises a cease-fire in Ukraine if Kyiv withdraws troops from occupied regions and renounces plans to join NATO","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/putin-promises-cease-fire-ukraine-kyiv-withdraws-troops-111117629","description":"Putin promises a cease-fire in Ukraine if Kyiv withdraws troops from occupied regions and renounces plans to join NATO","date":"2024-06-14T10:37:53Z","content":"Putin promises a cease-fire in Ukraine if Kyiv withdraws troops from occupied regions and renounces plans to join NATO MOSCOW -- Putin promises a cease-fire in Ukraine if Kyiv withdraws troops from occupied regions and renounces plans to join NATO. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"FIRDIA LISNAWATI Associated Press","title":"Australian man goes on trial in Indonesia for alleged drug possession on Bali","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/australian-man-trial-indonesia-alleged-drug-possession-bali-111082830","description":"A court on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali has began the trial of an Australian man who faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of possessing methamphetamine under the country\u2019s tough drug laws","date":"2024-06-13T08:38:24Z","content":"A court on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali has began the trial of an Australian man who faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of possessing methamphetamine under the country\u2019s tough drug laws DENPASAR, Indonesia -- A court on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali on Thursday began the trial of an Australian man who faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of possessing methamphetamine under the country's tough drug laws. Troy Andrew Smith, from Port Lincoln in South Australia, was arrested on April 30 after police raided his hotel near Kuta beach, a popular tourist spot, and seized 3.15 grams (0.1 ounce) of crystal methamphetamine from his room, authorities said. The arrest followed a tip that Smith had received a suspicious package containing toothpaste by mail from Australia. Prosecutors at the District Court in Denpasar, Bali's provincial capital, said he violated anti-narcotics laws that carry a penalty of up to 12 years in prison and a fine of 8 billion rupiah ($491,000). Authorities reduced the initial charge of drug trafficking, which carries a possible death penalty, to the less serious charge of drug use after a police drug assessment team determined he was a drug user. The 49-year-old accountant confessed to using drugs since 2020 to stop drinking alcohol, and denied being a dealer, lead prosecutor Isa Ulinnuha said. \u201cHe was not involved in illicit narcotics trafficking, but was a narcotics abuser in the moderate category,\u201d Ulinnuha told the court. \u201cTherefore, we also recommend that he undergo a psychological evaluation and inpatient medical rehabilitation for at least six months in a government rehabilitation facility.\u201d After the charges against Smith were read, the panel of three judges adjourned the trial until June 20. Smith\u2019s lawyer, Ida Bagus Gumilang Galih Sakti, said he would seek to prove that Smith is a user, not a trafficker, and has no connection with any drug network.

President Joe Biden said the agreement to tap into the windfall profits on some $280 billion in frozen Russian assets held in Europe would put that money to work for Ukraine. \u201cAnother reminder to (Vladimir) Putin: We're not backing down. In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression,\u201d Biden said at an evening news conference, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by his side. The agreement was hashed out hours before Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni opened the summit at a luxury resort in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity. She compared the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \u201cwith their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future.\u201d Beyond discussing Ukraine, the war in Gaza and China's industrial policy, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering. He\u2019ll be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders \u2014 Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kis Saied \u2014 to press Meloni's development and migration initiatives on the continent.  Along with Zelenskyy, other guests included Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron also facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts. The U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia\u2019s frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.  \u201cIt is a strong signal that we are sending to Ukraine that we will support Ukraine in its fight for freedom for as long as it takes,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \"It is also a strong signal to Putin that Putin cannot outlast us,\u201d she said. A French official said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen \u2014 for example, when the war ends \u2014 then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries. Zelenskyy listed the asset deal as one of many arrangements finalized during the summit, including a bilateral security agreement with the U.S. and Japan. \"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X. Sunak, for his part, announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine and a new round of sanctions against suppliers of munitions and other aid to Russia\u2019s military located in China, Israel, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.  Meloni went into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than in the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy\u2019s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU. The leaders of the G7\u2019s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany. Meloni didn't hesitate to flex her far-right muscles in the opening sessions: Italian negotiators successfully removed the word abortion from the G7 final communique. The text however does reaffirm commitments made at last year's G7, where abortion rights were specified, according to a draft seen by the ANSA news agency. \u201cI regret this,\u201d Macron said about the text, answering the question of an Italian reporter on the sidelines of the summit. He recalled that France had included a women's right to abortion in its Constitution, and that France defends \u201cthis vision of equality between women and men.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a vision that\u2019s shared across all the political spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret it, but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\u201d he told the Italian reporter. Meloni, who campaigned on a \u201cGod, Family, Fatherland\u201d motto, has insisted that she won't roll back abortion rights in Italy, where they have been legal since 1978, but the center-left opposition worries she is slowly chipping away at them. The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that\u2019s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia\u2019s medieval white-stone hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010. Located next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it was sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.

The ministers are meeting over two days at NATO headquarters in Brussels in the last high-level talks before a summit hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington on July 9-11, where the military organization\u2019s leaders are expected to announce financial support for Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s Western allies are trying to bolster their military support as Russian troops launch attacks along the more than 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, taking advantage of a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. European Union money was also held up by political infighting. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is chairing Thursday\u2019s meeting, said that Ukraine\u2019s beleaguered armed forces need longer-term predictability about the kinds of weapons, ammunition and funds they can expect to receive. \u201cThe whole idea is to minimize the risk for gaps and delays as we saw earlier this year,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters. The hold-up, he said, \u201cis one of the reasons why the Russians are now able to push and to actually occupy more land in Ukraine.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s full-fledged invasion in February 2022, Ukraine\u2019s Western backers have routinely met as part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, run by the Pentagon, to drum up weapons and ammunition for Kyiv. A fresh meeting was held at NATO headquarters on Thursday. Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said that his country would send Ukraine 2,300 rocket motors, and that 80,000 more of the devices are being tested. \"Pending the results of those tests, we intend to ship more packages of these motors to our Ukrainian partners in the future,\u201d he told reporters. But no progress was made on tracking down the Patriot guided missile systems that Ukraine so badly needs and has been requesting for months. A key advantage of the U.S.-made systems, apart from their effectiveness, is that Ukrainian troops are already trained to use them. \u201cI continue to work this,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters after chairing the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure they have the capability they need.\u201d While the contact group meetings have resulted in significant battlefield support, they have been of an ad-hoc and unpredictable nature. Stoltenberg has spearheaded an effort to have NATO take up some of the slack. The idea is for the 32-nation military alliance to coordinate the security assistance and training process, partly by using NATO\u2019s command structure and drawing on funds from its common budget. Stoltenberg said he hopes Biden and his counterparts will agree in Washington to maintain the funding level for military support they have provided Ukraine since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion in February 2022. He estimates this at around 40 billion euros ($43 billion) worth of equipment each year. On Wednesday, Hungary announced that it would not veto the plan as long as it\u2019s not forced to take part. \u201cI asked the Secretary-General to make it clear that all military action outside NATO territory can only be voluntary in nature, according to NATO rules and our traditions,\u201d Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cHungary has received the guarantees we need.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest security alliance does not send weapons or ammunition to Ukraine as an organization, and has no plans to put troops on the ground. But many of its members give help on a bilateral basis, and jointly provide more than 90% of the country\u2019s military support. The other 31 allies see Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as an existential security threat to Europe, but most of them, including Biden, have been extremely cautious to ensure that NATO is not drawn into a wider conflict with Russia. NATO operates on the basis that an attack on any single ally will be met with a response from them all. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"Widespread outage hits Puerto Rico as customers demand ouster of private electric company","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/widespread-outage-hits-puerto-rico-customers-demand-ouster-111079553","description":"A widespread power outage has hit Puerto Rico and left more than 300,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory\u2019s power plants shut down","date":"2024-06-13T02:22:51Z","content":"A widespread power outage has hit Puerto Rico and left more than 340,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory\u2019s power plants shut down SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A widespread power outage hit Puerto Rico Wednesday night, leaving more than 340,000 customers without electricity after two of the U.S. territory\u2019s power plants shut down. The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayam\u00f3n, Caguas and Carolina. Luma Energy, which operates transmission and distribution for Puerto Rico\u2019s power authority, said on X that the outage was tied to an issue with the power plants\u2019 transmission lines. It provided a statement to The Associated Press saying it was investigating the outage that coincided with the shutdown of units operated by Genera PR, which operates and maintains state power generation units. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi condemned the outage and said he was demanding answers and solutions from Luma and Genera PR. \u201cThe events that have been occurring in recent weeks with our electrical system are unacceptable,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cWhile it is true that we have old plants and transmission lines in terrible condition, the people continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of sense of urgency that private operators are demonstrating.\u201d Both Luma and Genera PR were selected as private operators under Pierluisi's administration. The outage is the most recent in a string of blackouts to hit Puerto Rico, which is still trying to rebuild the grid after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm. The outage prompted the mayor of the San Juan capital, Miguel Romero, to declare a state of emergency late Wednesday as he accused Luma of sharing limited information about the ongoing blackouts. \u201cThere are thousands of children with specific feeding needs, as well as older adults who often need therapy machines to protect their health and often save their lives,\u201d the decree stated. Scores of Puerto Ricans took to social media to condemn the most recent outage and demand the ouster of Luma, noting that it occurred amid excessive heat warnings. Not all on the island of 3.2 million people with a poverty rate of more than 40% can afford generators or solar panels. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press","title":"G7 summit opens with deal to use Russian assets for Ukraine as EU's traditional powers recalibrate","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/g7-summit-opens-deal-russian-assets-ukraine-eus-111080576","description":"A Group of Seven summit is opening in Italy with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral","date":"2024-06-13T04:22:27Z","content":"A Group of Seven summit is opening in Italy with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral BARI, Italy -- A Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right. Diplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden. Beyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He\u2019ll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders \u2014 Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied \u2014 to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.  Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts. The U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia\u2019s frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.  A French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen \u2014 say if the war ends \u2014 then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries. In addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.  Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy\u2019s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU. The leaders of the G7\u2019s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany. As a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique. A French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron\u2019s office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing. \u201cWhile it\u2019s unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially \u2018Mediterranean Summit,\u201d said Nick O\u2019Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council. That includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe. Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses. He'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \u201cmerchants of death.\u201d But Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime. The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that\u2019s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia\u2019s medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010. Located next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit. No such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi\u2019s port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board. As with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \u201cdinner for the poor\u201d on Friday night calling for \u201cpeace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\u201d ___ Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"EU court orders Hungary to pay 200 million euros fine, plus extra 1M euros per day for failure to apply asylum policies","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/eu-court-orders-hungary-pay-200-million-euros-111082490","description":"EU court orders Hungary to pay 200 million euros fine, plus extra 1M euros per day for failure to apply asylum policies","date":"2024-06-13T08:22:03Z","content":"EU court orders Hungary to pay 200 million euros fine, plus extra 1M euros per day for failure to apply asylum policies BRUSSELS -- EU court orders Hungary to pay 200 million euros fine, plus extra 1M euros per day for failure to apply asylum policies. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"European Court of Justice fines Hungary 200 million euros for failing to comply with asylum rules","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/european-court-justice-fines-hungary-200-million-euros-111082651","description":"The European Court of Justice has ordered Hungary to pay a fine of 200 million euros and a further 1 million euros per day of delay for failing to comply with the bloc\u2019s asylum rules","date":"2024-06-13T08:37:58Z","content":"The European Court of Justice has ordered Hungary to pay a fine of 200 million euros and a further 1 million euros per day of delay for failing to comply with the bloc\u2019s asylum rules BRUSSELS -- The European Union\u2019s top court ordered Hungary to pay a fine of 200 million euros ($216 million) on Thursday for persistently breaking the bloc\u2019s asylum rules despite a previous European Court of Justice ruling, plus an additional 1 million euros for every day it fails to comply going forward. Hungary had not implemented a 2020 ruling from top EU judges in Luxembourg, the ECJ wrote in a press release. \u201cThat failure, which consists in deliberately avoiding the application of a common EU policy as a whole, constitutes an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law.\u201d Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n slammed the ruling as \u201coutrageous and unacceptable.\u201d  \u201cIt seems that illegal migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform X. Hungary\u2019s anti-immigrant government has taken a hard line on people entering the country since well over 1 million people entered Europe in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria. The case concerns changes Hungary made to its asylum system in the wake of that crisis, when some 400,000 people passed through Hungary on their way to Western Europe. Hungary built fences protected by razor wire on its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia and a pair of transit zones for holding asylum seekers on its border with Serbia. Those transit zones have since closed.  The measures were part of Orban\u2019s increasingly strict anti-immigration policies and the extreme minimization of Hungary\u2019s asylum system. Back in 2020, the ECJ found that Budapest\u2019s policies had restricted access to international protection, unlawfully detained asylum applicants and failed to observe their right to stay in Hungary while their application went through the full due process, the court recalled on Thursday. The transit zones were closed in 2020, shortly after the first ECJ ruling. But the European Commission, which is responsible for monitoring the 27 EU member states\u2019 compliance with their shared laws, took the view that Budapest had still not complied and requested the European Court of Justice to fine Hungary, the ECJ said Thursday. After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020, the Hungarian government also pushed through a law forcing people seeking international protection to travel to Belgrade or Kyiv to apply for a travel permit at its embassies there to enter Hungary. Only once back could they file their applications. The European Commission took Hungary to the European Court of Justice over the law, insisting that the country had failed to fulfil its obligations under the 27-nation\u2019s blocs rules. The rules oblige all member countries to have common procedures for granting asylum. People have the right to apply for asylum or other forms of international protection if they fear for their safety in their home countries or face the prospect of persecution based on their race, religion, ethnic background, gender or other discrimination. ___ Samuel Petrequin in Brussels contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"The Latest | US national security adviser says Israel stands behind cease-fire proposal","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/latest-us-national-security-adviser-israel-stands-cease-111083385","description":"U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan has pushed back against assertions that Israel isn\u2019t fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House","date":"2024-06-13T09:34:24Z","content":"U.S. President Joe Biden says he doesn\u2019t expect to reach a cease-fire deal for Gaza in the near future U.S. President Joe Biden said Thursday he doesn\u2019t expect to seal a Gaza cease-fire deal in the near future, as an American-backed proposal with global support has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas.

The escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah\u2019s rocket fire, and as the militant group seeks to pressure Israel during the cease-fire negotiations in support of its ally Hamas. Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies. U.N. agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.

Local media reported the strike hit a three-story residential building and that a number of wounded people, including women and children, were transported to local hospitals, which put out a call for blood donations. It was not immediately clear who the target of the strike was. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have clashed almost daily for more than eight months against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. The clashes have escalated in recent days. On Tuesday, Israel killed the highest-ranking Hezbollah commander in the conflict to date. The militant group has responded by intensifying its barrages of missiles fired into northern Israel. JERUSALEM \u2014 Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite news network will remain closed in Israel \u2014 its reporting operations frozen, website blocked and offices shuttered \u2014 until late July and possibly longer, an Israeli court said Thursday. The court said the news outlet must remain shut down for 45 more days starting Thursday because letting it operate could pose a threat to Israel\u2019s security interests, alleging a connection between the Qatari-owned network and the Hamas militant group. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim. The court's decision was denounced by an Israeli rights group that is mounting a legal challenge to the new wartime law that shuttered Al Jazeera. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel said Thursday that the order \u201cviolates freedom of expression and freedom of the press\u201d and threatened to appeal to Israel\u2019s highest court. Israel shut down the network's local operations last month. Al Jazeera has maintained 24-hour coverage in Gaza during the war, and Israel\u2019s military operations have killed and wounded members of its staff. While including on-the-ground reporting of the war\u2019s devastating toll, Al Jazeera's Arabic-language arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups. JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli forces killed at least one Palestinian in a daylong raid Thursday into the northern West Bank, according to the military and Palestinian health officials. During what Israel\u2019s military described as an operation targeting militancy in a flashpoint area of the occupied territory, troops encircled a home in the town of Qabatiya looking for what the army said were \u201ctwo senior wanted suspects.\u201d Israeli soldiers exchanged fire with the suspects and hit the home with shoulder-fired missiles, and the two were killed, the military statement said. As of Thursday night, Palestinian health officials had only confirmed the death of one man, 21-year-old Qais Mohammed Zakarneh. Israel\u2019s military said it also arrested several Palestinians suspected of militancy and dug up explosives planted in the ground. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war Oct. 7, over 530 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank. BORGO EGNAZIA, Italy \u2014 U.S. President Joe Biden said Thursday he doesn\u2019t expect to reach a cease-fire deal for Gaza in the near future, as Israel and Hamas have not fully embraced an American-backed proposal with global support. Biden said international leaders at the Group of Seven summit in Italy had discussed the cease-fire, but when asked by reporters if a truce deal wound be reached soon, Biden replied simply, \u201cNo,\u201d adding, \u201cI haven\u2019t lost hope.\u201d Earlier Thursday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan pushed back against assertions that Israel isn\u2019t fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas. \u201cIsrael has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\u201d Sullivan said. Hamas responded to the plan by offering amendments, and Sullivan said the goal is \u201cto figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\u201d Hamas says the requested changes aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. The cease-fire proposal announced by Biden includes those provisions, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. At a news conference later Thursday, Biden said, \u201cThe biggest hang-up so far is Hamas refusing to sign on, even though they have submitted something similar.\u201d He said it remains to be seen whether a deal comes \u201cto fruition.\u201d But he said he remains committed to pushing for the two sides to come together on the three-phase deal he publicly outlined late last month. MADRID \u2014 Spain and Turkey called on the international community to take action to end the eight-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. At a bilateral trade summit in Madrid on Thursday, the two NATO members reiterated calls to halt the fighting and deliver more aid to Palestinians enduring a humanitarian crisis in the war-ravaged territory. \u201cFor too long the international community has looked the other way,\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said at a news conference. \u201cIt has thought that without resolving this conflict we could live in peace and stability. What has happened during these eight months has opened the eyes of the world.\u201d S\u00e1nchez also demanded the release of hostages held by Hamas. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the United States and the other U.N. Security Council members to lobby Israel. On Monday, the Security Council overwhelmingly approved its first resolution endorsing a cease-fire plan, but neither Israel nor Hamas has fully embraced it.  Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized a Palestinian state on May 28. Turkey did so in 1988. S\u00e1nchez urged other countries to follow in their footsteps.  BEIRUT \u2014 The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah attacked at least six Israeli military posts and bases on Thursday with rockets and explosive drones, in a second day of attacks on northern Israel in retaliation for killing one of the group\u2019s top commanders. Cross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have been taking place almost daily since the war in Gaza began in October. This week\u2019s escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah\u2019s rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza. Hezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel. The Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas. Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights. The military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets \u2014 referring to drones \u2014 and six were intercepted. Israel said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday. Hezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group\u2019s Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border. Hezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world\u2019s most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry. Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed. BAGHDAD \u2014 Iraq\u2019s top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country. \u201cThere are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\u201d Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza. Kani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months. In recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \u201cprepared for very intense action\u201d along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight. FASANO, Italy \u2014 U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn\u2019t fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House. \u201cIsrael has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\u201d Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit. \u201cTo this day they stand behind the proposal.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\u201d Sullivan added. Sullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \u201cto figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\u201d \u201cThe goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\u201d he told reporters. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.  Some are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas. \u201cWe are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \u201cThey negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\u201d  More than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes. \u201cEvery day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\u201d said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \u201cWe are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\u201d The United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don\u2019t have enough clean drinking water. Other residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks. \u201cI expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\u201d said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \u201cThe negotiations are false.\u201d DOHA, Qatar \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \u201cworkable\u201d and some not. The back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides. The cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 will keep trying to \u201cclose this deal.\u201d He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands. \u201cHamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \u201cI believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn\u2019t mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\u201d The Palestinian militant group says the \u201camendments\u201d aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.  Those provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.  The proposal\u2019s three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase. At the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \u201ca permanent end to hostilities\u201d and \u201cfull withdrawal\u201d of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages. A major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"US reporter Evan Gershkovich, jailed in Russia on espionage charges, to stand trial, officials say","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/us-reporter-evan-gershkovich-jailed-russia-espionage-charges-111089317","description":"Russian officials say U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich, jailed in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s office said Thursday that an indictment of Gershkovich has been finalized and his ...","date":"2024-06-13T13:33:57Z","content":"Russian officials say U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich, jailed in Russia for over a year on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg MOSCOW -- U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been jailed for over a year in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, where he was detained, authorities said Thursday.  An indictment of The Wall Street Journal reporter has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city about 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) east of Moscow, according to Russia\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s office. There was no word on when the trial would begin. Gershkovich, 32, is accused of \u201cgathering secret information\u201d on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General\u2019s office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him.  Gershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the United States. The reporter, his employer and the U.S. government denied the allegations, and Washington designated him as wrongfully detained. Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged after arresting Gershkovich that he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but provided no evidence to back up the accusations.  The U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller slammed the development, saying there was \u201cabsolutely zero credibility to those charges\" and adding that the U.S. government would continue to work to bring Gershkovich home.  \u201cEvan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime,\" Miller said. \"The charges against him are false. And the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately.\u201d  The Biden administration has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\u201d a statement by Almar Latour, Dow Jones CEO and publisher of the Journal, and Emma Tucker, the Journal's editor in chief, said.  They added that the charges against Gershkovich were \u201cfalse and baseless.\u201d \"The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan\u2019s case is an assault on free press,\" the statement said. \u201cWe had hoped to avoid this moment and now expect the U.S. government to redouble efforts to get Evan released.\u201d Roger Carstens, the Biden administration\u2019s special presidential envoy who serves as the U.S. government\u2019s top hostage negotiator, said that though he had been hopeful about striking a deal to get Gershkovich home before this point, the latest development \u201cdoesn\u2019t slow or stop us down.\u201d  \u201cThe bottom line is, this was not unexpected,\u201d he said.  Uralvagonzavod, a state tank and railroad car factory in the city of Nizhny Tagil, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, became known in 2011-12 as a bedrock of support for President Vladimir Putin. Plant foreman Igor Kholmanskih appeared on Putin\u2019s annual phone-in program in December 2011 and denounced mass protests occurring in Moscow at the time as a threat to \u201cstability,\u201d proposing that he and his colleagues travel to the Russian capital to help suppress the unrest. A week later, Putin appointed Kholmanskikh to be his envoy in the region.  Putin has said he believed a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany, which appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. Asked last week by The Associated Press about Gershkovich, Putin said the U.S. is \u201ctaking energetic steps\u201d to secure his release. He told international news agencies in St. Petersburg that any such releases \u201caren\u2019t decided via mass media\u201d but through a \u201cdiscreet, calm and professional approach.\u201d \u201cAnd they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\u201d he added in an allusion to a potential prisoner swap. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.  He was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich\u2019s arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine. The son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, Gershkovich was fluent in Russian and moved to the country in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022. Since his arrest, Gershkovich has been held at Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo Prison, a notorious czarist-era prison used during Josef Stalin\u2019s purges, when executions were carried out in its basement. U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, who regularly visited Gershkovich in prison and attended his court hearings, has called the charges against him \u201cfiction\u201d and said that Russia is \u201cusing American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d Since sending troops to Ukraine, Russian authorities have detained several U.S. nationals and other Westerners, seemingly bolstering that idea. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich jailed in Russia on espionage charges to stand trial in Yekaterinburg, authorities say (CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert misspelled Gershkovich's name)","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/us-reporter-evan-gehshkovich-jailed-russia-espionage-charges-111089225","description":"U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich jailed in Russia on espionage charges to stand trial in Yekaterinburg, authorities say (CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert misspelled Gershkovich's name)","date":"2024-06-13T13:18:02Z","content":"U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich jailed in Russia on espionage charges to stand trial in Yekaterinburg, authorities say (CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert misspelled Gershkovich's name) MOSCOW -- U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich jailed in Russia on espionage charges to stand trial in Yekaterinburg, authorities say (CORRECTS: A previous APNewsAlert misspelled Gershkovich's name). 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"The Associated Press","title":"South Africa's ANC party says it has a broad agreement with the main opposition and others on a coalition government","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/south-africas-anc-party-broad-agreement-main-opposition-111101170","description":"South Africa's ANC party says it has a broad agreement with the main opposition and others on a coalition government","date":"2024-06-13T18:22:04Z","content":"South Africa's ANC party says it has a broad agreement with the main opposition and others on a coalition government CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South Africa's ANC party says it has a broad agreement with the main opposition and others on a coalition government. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"},{"author":"LORNE COOK Associated Press","title":"Canada's defense investment plans put it on track to meet NATO guideline, minister says","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/canadas-defense-investment-plans-put-track-meet-nato-111127842","description":"Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair says his country looks on track to meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by 2030","date":"2024-06-14T15:26:20Z","content":"Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair says his country looks on track to meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by 2030 BRUSSELS -- Canada looks on track to meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by the end of the decade, Defense Minister Bill Blair said Friday, notably by boosting investment in the Arctic near its shared border with Russia as the region warms quickly because of climate change. After Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO allies agreed to halt budget cuts and move toward spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade. Canada was barely spending 1% at the time. Last year, as it became clear that Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine would grind on, they decided that 2% should be a spending minimum. According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023. \u201cOur country finds itself at a pivotal moment. Our sovereignty and our security are no longer guaranteed by our geographic location,\" Blair said. Canada is surrounded by three oceans with NATO's biggest ally, the U.S., as its neighbor. \"But the new threat environment, the greater accessibility of our Arctic, the new technologies and the actions of our adversaries have taught us that we need to be ready,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. Blair said that he expects Canada's defense spending to climb to at least 1.75% of GDP by 2029, but that other investment, notably replacing the country's aging submarine fleet or purchasing integrated air defense and missile systems, would probably push the figure past the 2% mark. \u201cI believe it brings us inevitably to over 2% of defense spending. But I\u2019ve got some work to do in order to be able to articulate that both to my own country and to our allies,\u201d he said. Canada already plans to buy surveillance aircraft, helicopters and restock its ammunition supplies. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that he expects around two thirds of the alliance\u2019s 32 member countries to spend 2% of GDP on their defense budgets this year, up from just three countries a decade ago. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"}]}

As the group reaches its finale in Florida on Friday and Sunday, the spotlight is now on the skies. The weather forecast for both USA\u2019s match against Ireland on Friday, and Pakistan\u2019s match against the Irish on Sunday, looks grim with regards to there being much chance of play. India have already qualified as group winners while USA are in the box seat in second spot with two wins, including against Pakistan, to their name already. Pakistan remain hopeful of progressing in the second qualification spot but matters could be taken out of their hands before Sunday\u2019s meeting with the Irish. It is all to play for and, weather permitting, we could be in for a nerve-jangling final two rounds in Group A. The streets in Broward County have been flooded, and weather warnings have been issued to locals. Local weather forecast shows an 80 percent chance of heavy rainfall that could cause further flooding. It does not bode well for players and fans of both sides \u2013 as well as those of Pakistan. If play begins, both teams will need to play at least five overs each to constitute a game. There\u2019s an added time of 90 minutes to finish the game should play be possible. If the weather remains true to its forecast, the game could be washed out without a ball being bowled. An abandoned game will leave both teams with a point each, giving USA five points from their four games and ensuring their Super Eight qualification ahead of Pakistan, Canada and Ireland. Even if the 2009 champions beat Ireland in the last game, they will not be able to bag more than four points in total. The pitch will come into play for the first time in the tournament after the Nepal vs Sri Lanka game was washed out without a ball being bowled. While the venue has produced par scores in the past, a run of showers and thunderstorms could make it a more even contest between bat and ball. Each side has won a game apiece in their two T20 meetings thus far. Despite their loss to India, USA will be encouraged by their performance against some of the biggest stars of the game. They also have a string of good results to boost their confidence. Ireland have had a forgettable tournament so far, losing to India and Canada, and will look at this match as a turning point. USA: L W W L W\nIreland: L L W W W The hosts could go with the same team that has won them two matches, which means captain and top-order batter Monank Patel could replace Shayan Jahangir if the former is fit to play. Squad:\u00a0Monank Patel (captain), Shayan Jahangir, Andries Gous, Nitish Kumar, Steven Taylor, Harmeet Singh, Corey Anderson, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Khan, Jessy Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar, Nosthush Kenjige. Ireland could make a change or two to the side that has lost two games in two, but it is unclear where that shuffle will come. Squad: Paul Stirling (captain), Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Josh Little, Barry McCarthy, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker, Ben White, Craig Young.

Prominent #MeToo activist and journalist Sophia Huang Xueqin has been jailed for five years by a court in southern China after being found guilty of \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d. Labour activist Wang Jianbing, who stood trial with Huang, was sentenced to three years and six months in prison after being found guilty of the same charge at the Guangzhou Intermediate Court on Friday, according to a statement from the Free Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing group. It added that 35-year-old Huang told the court she would appeal. It was not clear whether Wang, 40, planned to do the same. \u201c[The sentence] was longer than we expected,\u201d a spokesperson for the group told the Reuters news agency, asking to remain anonymous for safety reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should have been this severe, and it is completely unnecessary. So we support Huang Xueqin\u2019s intention to appeal.\u201d In the run-up to their arrest in September 2021, Huang was involved in several #MeToo campaigns in China that provided support to survivors of sexual assault and harassment, while Wang was also a prominent #MeToo supporter and provided legal support for people with disabilities and workers with occupational diseases. Huang and Wang went on trial last year in a closed court over activities including weekly gatherings with fellow activists, and their involvement in online human rights education. Dozens of their friends were summoned by police and had their homes searched and electronic devices confiscated, according to Amnesty. The pair denied any wrongdoing, their supporters said. \u201cTomorrow marks exactly one thousand days since Sophia Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested,\u201d said Amnesty\u2019s China Director Sarah Brooks. \u201cThese convictions will prolong their deeply unjust detention and have a further chilling effect on human rights and social advocacy in a country where activists face increasing state crackdowns.\u201d There was a heavy security presence around Guangzhou People\u2019s Intermediate Court on Friday morning, with police questioning bystanders, according to Reuters. The charge \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d is frequently used by the Chinese government against critics. It carries a maximum prison term of five years but can be longer if the suspect is considered a ringleader or to have committed serious crimes. \u201cThese malicious and totally groundless convictions show just how terrified the Chinese government is of the emerging wave of activists who dare to speak out to protect the rights of others,\u201d Brooks said, calling for Huang and Wang\u2019s immediate release. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined in 2022 that Wang was being arbitrarily detained and has repeatedly called on China to repeal the crime of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d or bring it into line with international standards. Huang, who reported on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong five years ago, was also detained by Chinese police for three months in late 2019 when she was accused of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d.

More than 1.5 million Muslim pilgrims have gathered in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mecca for the start of Hajj, taking place this year against the harrowing backdrop of Israel\u2019s continued onslaught on the Gaza Strip. The annual pilgrimage began on Friday with crowds of robed worshippers circling the Kaaba, the black cubic structure at Mecca\u2019s Grand Mosque, many expressing sadness eight months into Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. \u201cOur brothers are dying, and we can see it with our own eyes,\u201d said 75-year-old Zahra Benizahra from Morocco. Palestinians in Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive into the strip\u2019s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt. \u201cWe were deprived of Hajj because of the closure of the crossing and because of the war and destruction,\u201d Amna Abu Mutlaq, 75, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe are unable to leave and every time we try to leave, they tell us that the crossing is closed and we cannot leave. They deprived us of everything.\u201d Palestinian authorities said 4,200 people from the occupied West Bank had arrived in Mecca for the pilgrimage. One thousand more pilgrims, from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war, who were already outside Gaza before Rafah was closed, were invited by King Salman of Saudi Arabia. However, the Gulf kingdom\u2019s minister in charge of religious pilgrimages, Tawfiq al-Rabiah, warned last week that \u201cno political activity\u201d would be tolerated during the event. This year\u2019s Hajj has also brought Syrian pilgrims to Mecca on direct flights from Damascus for the first time in more than a decade, part of an ongoing thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and conflict-stricken Syria. Syrians in rebel-held areas used to cross the border into neighbouring Turkey in their exhausting trip to Mecca for Hajj. Saudi authorities expect the number of pilgrims attending Hajj to exceed two million this year. One of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, it involves a series of rituals in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia that take several days to complete. Reporting from in front of the Great Mosque of Mecca, Al Jazeera\u2019s Hashem Ahelbarra said: \u201cWe\u2019re expecting pilgrims \u2026 to perform the Friday prayers, to go to the plains of Mina to spend the night, and then tomorrow is going to be the very highlight of the Hajj with the day that they will spend in prayers, contemplation and incantations at the valley of Arafat. \u201cThis is an extremely complex operation \u2026 The Saudis are deploying massive personnel throughout this journey to ensure smooth traffic and safety for all the pilgrims,\u201d he said. One of the five pillars of Islam, Hajj must be performed at least once by all Muslims who have the means to do so. Some have waited for years for the chance to make the trip, with permits allocated by Saudi authorities on a quota basis for each country. Nonaartina Hajipaoli, 50, told the AFP news agency she felt privileged to be among the 1,000 pilgrims who came this year from Brunei in Southeast Asia. \u201cI\u2019m speechless, I can\u2019t describe what I feel,\u201d she said. The pilgrims will first perform the tawaf \u2013 circling seven times around the Kaaba. They will then head towards Mina, a valley surrounded by craggy mountains several kilometres outside Mecca, where they will spend the night in air-conditioned tents. The climax will come on Saturday with daylong prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon. The pilgrimage is a moving spiritual experience for pilgrims who believe it absolves sins and brings them closer to God, while uniting the world\u2019s more than two billion Muslims. It is also a chance to pray for peace in many conflict-stricken Arab and Muslim countries, including Yemen and Sudan, where more than a year of war between rival generals has created the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis. As has been the case for several years, the gathering is taking place during the sweltering Saudi summer, with officials predicting average highs of 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit). Mohammed al-Abdulali, spokesman for the Saudi Ministry of Health, told the AFP news agency this week there were more than 10,000 documented cases of heat-related illnesses last year, 10 percent of which were heat stroke. Mitigation measures this year include misting systems and heat-reflective road coverings. \u201cThe authorities have been asking pilgrims to take precautionary measures amid high temperatures expected throughout the Hajj,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahelbarra. A text message sent to pilgrims on Thursday instructed them to \u201cdrink water regularly, more than 2 litres daily\u201d and to \u201calways carry an umbrella\u201d, warning that temperatures could climb to 48C (118F).

Taipei, Taiwan \u2013 Earlier this year, electric car enthusiast Anders Berner eagerly opened the door of a BYD Seal to take the sedan on a test drive outside the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Berner was already impressed by how far Chinese EV makers like BYD Auto had come in a short time. \u201cMany Chinese EVs are made with excellent materials and have been put together well \u2013 they are high-quality cars,\u201d Berner, a mechanical engineer by trade, told Al Jazeera. \u201cAnd in terms of battery technology for EVs, Chinese companies are leading the field.\u201d Berner is among those who believe that Chinese EVs have the qualities needed to become the dominant player in the global car market. Compared with Western brands, Chinese EVs have a leg-up in terms of affordability. In the European Union, Chinese EVs typically sell for 20 percent less than EU-made models, according to the European Commission. Chinese battery maker CATL, which supplies Tesla, Volkswagen and BMW as well as Chinese EV makers, alone supplies about 40 percent of the world\u2019s EV batteries and in late April unveiled the first battery with a driving range of more than 1,000 kilometres on a single charge. Chinese EVs are increasingly making their mark overseas. Shenzhen-based BYD sold 525,409 EVs across all markets during the final quarter of last year to become the world\u2019s biggest electric car company, beating Tesla\u2019s 484,507 units. China narrowly failed to overtake Japan as the world\u2019s largest car exporter overall with 5.22 million vehicles sold overseas. In the European Union, Chinese EVs increased their market share to 8.2 percent in 2023, up from 0.5 percent in 2019. The European Federation for Transport and Environment has projected that market share to rise to 11 percent this and as high as 20 percent by 2027. Growing concern in Western capitals, however, is threatening to derail Chinese EVs\u2019 rapid rise. United States President Joe Biden has cast China\u2019s industrial policy as a national security threat, pledging not to allow its manufacturers to \u201cflood\u201d the US market with its vehicles. \u201cI am not going to let that happen on my watch,\u201d Biden said in March. Although the Chinese market share of EVs sold in the US is already negligible, Biden in May announced that he would quadruple tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100 percent and triple tariffs on Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries to 25 percent. The EU has echoed Washington\u2019s concerns. On Wednesday, the EU Commission announced that new duties of between 17.4 percent and 38.1 percent would be imposed on Chinese EVs from July 4 unless Beijing offers a \u201csolution\u201d to subsidies that the bloc says are distorting the market. The tariffs, introduced after the launch of a probe in October, come on top of already existing duties of 10 percent. The combined tariffs are close to the 50 percent mark that research provider Rhodium Group has estimated would be necessary for the EU to curb Chinese EV imports. But they also risk setting the EU on the path of a trade war with China, according to Rene Toender, an independent strategic adviser to the car industry in Scandinavia. So far, Beijing has called the EU tariff hikes a \u201ctypical case of protectionism\u201d and said, \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d At the same time, leading up to the EU announcement of the duties, the China Passenger Car Association described a hypothetical 20 percent tariff hike on Chinese EVs as \u201cunderstandable\u201d given the auto sector\u2019s role as a major employer in Europe. The auto industry provides about 13.8 million jobs in the EU, about 6 percent of all jobs in the bloc. In the US, about 9.7 million jobs, roughly 5 percent of private sector employment, depend on the industry. Toender said the EU has felt compelled to address a growing fear that the success of Chinese EVs could come at the expense of European jobs. \u201cAt the same time, the success of national car brands is a source of national pride in some countries,\u201d Toender Al Jazeera. \u201cSo, it would be a hard hit to see them lose out to Chinese manufacturers.\u201d Apart from risking Chinese retaliation, the US and EU measures also threaten to undermine efforts to lower carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The US government plans to end government purchases of fossil fuel cars by 2035, while several US states including California intend to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by the same year. The EU intends to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars across the bloc from the same date. Toender said such goals will be unattainable without open access to the Chinese EV industry since the EU accounts for less than 10 percent of global battery output, while China supplies about 76 percent. \u201cThere isn\u2019t sufficient battery capacity elsewhere to replace the Chinese production,\u201d Toender said. \u201cSo, the global expansion of the Chinese EV industry in the near future could very well be decided by how the West chooses to weigh its climate targets against minimising its EV imports from China.\u201d Meanwhile, Beijing is positioning the EV industry as a key plank of China\u2019s future economic development, according to Kasper Ingeman Beck, a postdoctoral scholar of China\u2019s political economy and state-led green transition at Copenhagen Business School. In 2015, the Chinese government highlighted \u201cnew energy vehicles\u201d as a key industry for securing the country\u2019s prosperity under its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d national industrial plan. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party now sees a narrow window of 10-15 years during which Beijing can take advantage of and shape ground-breaking new technological transformations that they see as the only option for lifting the country from a middle-income country to a high-income country,\u201d Beck told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey have pursued this through an investment-oriented economic model where politically chosen industries have received massive financial support.\u201d On the EV front, this focus has resulted in the creation of a crowded field of Chinese EV manufacturers pumped up on public money \u2013 which the Chinese economy is unlikely to be able to support in the long run, according to industry adviser Toender. \u201cSo right now Chinese car companies are engaged in a brutal fight to the death over who remains standing a few years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we are seeing Chinese manufacturers rapidly releasing new EV models, constantly innovating and slashing prices.\u201d Fierce competition combined with overinvestment have contributed to Chinese car companies currently manufacturing between 5 and 10 million excess vehicles a year. \u201cMany end up as exports as an unintended consequence of the investment-led economic model, not by design,\u201d Beck said. Toender said that the Chinese government is likely not actively trying to flood Western markets with excess EVs. \u201cThat would result in an even larger outcry and force Western lawmakers to shut the Chinese manufacturers out of the market for good,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the Chinese EVs that we do see making it to the European market are being priced much higher than at the cutthroat prices back in China.\u201d In some countries, BYD charges two or three times the price for some models compared with China. Toender said that is a sign that Beijing is not looking to make a quick profit, but to establish Chinese companies in the market long-term. In Copenhagen, Berner said his test drive of the BYD Seal left him feeling underwhelmed. \u201cIt is where it needs to be, but it doesn\u2019t wow,\u201d he said, adding that many Chinese EVs are less fine-tuned to drive than their European peers. \u201cSo, there is generally some room for improvement there.\u201d Still, Berner has little doubt that Chinese manufacturers will be able to iron out such niggles over time. Despite the pressures facing Chinese EVs, he is convinced that Chinese EVs will become an increasingly common sight on European roads. \u201cAnd I think we will eventually come to accept Chinese EVs.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Al Jazeera","title":"One sailor injured, merchant ship on fire after Houthi missile attack","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/14\/one-sailor-injured-merchant-ship-on-fire-after-houthi-missile-attack","description":"The Palau-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated M\/V Verbena was delivering timber to Italy when it came under fire.","date":"2024-06-14T04:58:21Z","content":"The Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated M\/V Verbena was delivering timber to Italy when it came under attack. Two cruise missiles launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have struck a bulk cargo carrier in the Gulf of Aden, severely injuring one of the crew. The M\/V Verbena, a Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, and Polish-operated ship, \u201creported damage and subsequent fires on board. The crew continues to fight the fire. One civilian mariner was severely injured during the attack,\u201d the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAircraft from USS Philippine Sea medically evacuated the injured mariner to a partner force ship nearby for medical attention,\u201d it added. The Houthis, who are locked in a war with a Saudi-led coalition after removing Yemen\u2019s internationally-recognised government from Sanaa in 2014, have been targeting vessels with alleged Israeli links in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023. They say the action is in solidarity with the Palestinians over Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, in which at least 37,232 people have been killed. On Thursday, the Iran-backed group said it had carried out attacks on three ships over 24 hours, including on the Verbena, \u201cin retaliation to the crimes committed against our people in the Gaza Strip, and in response to the American-British aggression against our country\u201d. Earlier on Thursday, the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) centre said a vessel had been attacked and caught fire, while the private security firm Ambrey said a merchant vessel made a radio distress call saying it had been struck by a missile. The Houthis later claimed the attack on the Verbena, as well as attacks on two other ships in the Red Sea. Central Command said the Houthis had launched two ballistic missiles in the Red Sea that caused \u201cno injuries or significant damage\u201d. The UKMTO said one vessel earlier missed by the Houthis was hit by a \u201cthird projectile\u201d that caused \u201cminor damage\u201d. The vessel was able to remain under way, it said. The Verbena was loaded with timber and was on its way from Malaysia to Italy, according to CENTCOM. Security and military sources told the Reuters news agency that the Verbena still had power and steering capabilities. Thursday\u2019s attack marked the Houthis second direct hit on a merchant ship in two days. A day earlier, they claimed a series of small watercraft and missile attacks that left the Tutor, a Greek-owned coal carrier, taking in water near Hodeidah and in need of rescue. The Philippines\u2019 Department of Foreign Affairs condemned the assault on the Tutor, whose crew included Filipinos. The Houthi campaign in the Red Sea region has disrupted global shipping, causing delays and adding to international supply chain costs. The rebels have sunk one ship, seized another vessel and killed three seafarers in separate attacks. Shipping companies, meanwhile, have redirected their vessels around the southern tip of Africa adding a further 3,000-3,500 nautical miles (5,500-6,500km) to their route.

Pilgrimage \u2013 the devotional practice of journeying towards a site deemed sacred and collectively engaging in acts of worship and faith there \u2013\u00a0 has been a fundamental part of the human experience since time immemorial. It is a widespread and important practice in many religions. Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, Christians and Muslims all have pilgrimage as part of their religious worship. The right and need to assemble for common goals are indeed innately and intrinsically human. Even the American Constitution deems the right to assemble a necessary legal and fundamental right in its First Amendment. Pilgrimages, which bring thousands \u2013 and sometimes millions \u2013 of human beings together in a single site, are usually completely peaceful. Unlike the participants of similarly large secular gatherings like sporting events and music festivals, devoted pilgrims rarely resort to violence or harm their environment. No doubt there are some fanatics who assemble people for supposed religious goals and entice them towards violent campaigns, but their actions are not representative of pilgrimages, or the core values of any religion. Our world today is plagued by war, violence, murder, rape, burglary, racism, domestic violence, child abuse, drug dependency, sex trafficking, hunger, homelessness, fraud in every industry, corruption in institutions and government, mental health crises, and an escalating climate emergency. The value of human life and labour is forgotten as most services and industries turned to automation and came to be dominated by machines a la, A Brave New World. Meanwhile, most secular forms of assembly and organisation have proved themselves to be recipes not for unity and peace, but for hate, harm and chaos. In this context, we should perhaps turn to religious pilgrimages to find a way to rekindle peaceful human interaction and pave a new, peaceful path forward for humanity. As noted by Patrick Deneen in his 2018 book, Why Liberalism Failed, the mission of modernity and liberal society, namely, to create a peaceful world predicated on individual liberation and freedom, has proven to be a massive failure. As such, a fresh look at conventions that are as old as Adam might just save the day for us. Perhaps modernity could and should be replaced with, literal, antiquity! The right for human beings to assemble for worship and the right to protect places of worship is emphatically voiced in the Quran: \u201cHad Allah not repelled [the aggression of] some people by means of others, destruction would have come upon monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah\u2019s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those help Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty.\u201d (Surah al-Hajj (22): 40) For Muslims, this is the month of the Hajj, the universal pilgrimage. The Hajj \u2013 which means to make a firm intention \u2013 is the pilgrimage to the House of Allah in Mecca. This house which we call the Ka\u2019ba was rebuilt by Abraham, who is considered the founding father of three important religions: namely Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Adherents of these three faiths all claim they are representatives of the Abrahamic Faith. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in uniting members of the Abrahamic Faith. This seems to be a noble initiative and indeed one that the Quran calls for: Say, [O Prophet,] \u201cO People of the Book! Jews and Christians. Let us come to word that is common amongst us: that we will worship none but Allah, associate none with Him, nor take one another as lords instead of Allah\u2026\u201d (Surah Ali Imran (3): 64) Abraham was also the prophet who laid down the foundations for the rituals of the Hajj known as \u201cManasik\u201d. The descendants of Abraham observed the Manasik correctly for a long while, but eventually began to corrupt the rules and changed many rituals. By the time Prophet Muhammad was born, the Hajj had lost its original beauty of worship and was barely recognisable. Prophet Muhammad restored the Manasik to their original pristine Abrahamic convention when he performed his Hajj \u2013 which is the Hajj all Muslims perform today. Uniting people of the Abrahamic faith would require the faithful to adhere to the Civilizational Values (known as the Millah) Abraham promoted andpractisedd. Most of the values of the Millah are represented in the Muslim Hajj. While Muslims don their hajj garb, they are not allowed to argue, bicker and fight. In that state, they are not allowed to swat a fly, stamp a mosquito, scratch themselves such that blood comes out or hunt animals. They are not allowed to inflict harm on themselves or others; otherwise, they must pay a heavy penalty. The Quran states that the area around the Ka\u2019ba \u2013 known as the Haram \u2013 is a sanctuary and a place of safety and security. Harm cannot exist there. More than two million Muslims abide by this code every year. There are exceptionally few fights, robberies, or cases of abuse or harassment during the Hajj. There is an air of unity that is unmatched in any human assembly. Let\u2019s remember what Malcolm X wrote in his 1964 Letter from Mecca: \u201cNever have I witnessed such sincere hospitality and overwhelming spirit of true brotherhood as is practiced by people of all colors and races here in this ancient Holy Land, the home of Abraham, Muhammad and all the other Prophets of the Holy Scriptures. For the past week, I have been utterly speechless and spellbound by the graciousness I see displayed all around me by people of all colors. There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non-white. During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass, and slept on the same rug \u2013 while praying to the same God \u2013 with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in the deeds of the white Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan and Ghana.\u201d Unity through the worship of One God, unity of all peoples, at all times, and the absence of inflicting harm is the essence of the Muslim assembly at the Hajj. This is the code of the Abrahamic Faith which is incorporated in the message of Prophet Mohammad. Those who frown upon religion and Islam might want to take a second look at this universal providence! Influencers of the world who wish to rid the world of its ills and man-made problems will do well to follow a code that is steeped in formula that are revealed from the Divine Who is the Most Merciful and the Most Compassionate.

But the plan carries risks \u2014 and the threat of retaliation.","date":"2024-06-14T09:44:43Z","content":"The funds could help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. But the plan carries risks \u2014 and the threat of Russian retaliation. The G7 group of countries announced a plan on Thursday to use frozen Russian assets to finance a $50bn loan for Ukraine as Kyiv continues its desperate campaign to stop its bigger neighbour\u2019s forces from advancing further, 28 months into Moscow\u2019s war. The announcement came as leaders of the grouping, which consists of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, France and the European Union, met at an annual summit held in Puglia (Apulia), Italy. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy, who attended the summit, hailed the move as \u201ca vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war\u201d. But just hours after that announcement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova promised that there would be \u201cextremely painful\u201d measures in retaliation. Here\u2019s what we know about the frozen assets, how the loan is expected to work and what the risks might be for Kyiv and its Western allies: Many Western nations froze assets of the Russian Central Bank on their territory after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Those assets amount to about $300bn. Those frozen assets have generated some $3bn yearly in earnings through interests, and the US has long pressed for this money to be used to support Ukraine. Most of the assets are held and managed within the European Union. EU officials say the interests generated are not contractually owed to Moscow, and therefore represent unexpected gains for the holding countries. Some have pushed for Russian assets frozen in the West to themselves be handed over to Ukraine \u2014 but that is controversial, and will likely need clearances from courts and could represent a violation of international law.\u00a0Frozen assets are usually seen as belonging to the owner of those assets \u2014 not the country in which they are geographically located. Here\u2019s a breakdown of most overseas Russian assets that were originally frozen in 2022, according to data from the countries\u2019 central banks: The details are still being hashed out but the basic idea is this: One of the G7 entities \u2013 the EU or the US, for example \u2013 will take out a $50bn loan on international markets, and provide it upfront to Ukraine. Then, the interest on that loan will be financed by the profit being generated by the confiscated Russian assets. Ukraine is expected to use the money to buy weapons, but also to rebuild. A World Bank report in February estimated that the war-ravaged country\u2019s reconstruction costs stand at $486bn over the next 10 years. The funds are expected to reach Kyiv by the end of the year.\u00a0This means that it might not have an immediate effect on Ukraine\u2019s capabilities in the ongoing war. But the loan was always intended as a long-term plan. Some experts say US President Joe Biden has pushed for it, even as he has also sealed a new 10-year security plan to train Ukraine\u2019s military, at a politically volatile time in the United States. Former President Donald Trump, who is ahead of Biden in key swing states for their repeat matchup this November, has opposed US funding for Ukraine. In his first term in office, Trump withdrew the US from key global commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama \u2014 including the Paris climate change pact and the Iran nuclear deal. Yes. If Russia regains control over its assets, or if those are unfrozen as part of peace negotiations, G7 countries will have to find other ways to repay the loan. If the frozen Russian assets fail to generate the income needed to match the loan interests \u2014 because of market fluctuations \u2014 G7 nations will again need to find alternative ways to finance the loan repayment. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told reporters that all G7 countries would contribute to the loan, but details are unclear. The sanctions on Russian assets in Europe need a European Union vote of approval every year. In theory, a single veto vote from, say, Hungary \u2014 an EU member widely seen as soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 could sabotage the Ukraine loan plans.\u00a0Hungary blocked a tranche of EU aid to Ukraine earlier this year. Russia might also hit back against the G7 plan by doing the same \u2014 using Western assets in Russia that it froze amid the Ukraine war to compensate for the loss of revenue from its frozen assets in the West. While Russia does not have access to many assets from Western central banks, it has said that it has the assets of Western companies that were operating there before the war. Russia claims these assets are worth roughly the same as the $300bn in Russian assets frozen in the West.

Chile\u2019s weather service issued the highest level of alarm, covering some 14 million of the 20 million people living in six of the country\u2019s 16 regions, but this was later lifted as authorities said 80 percent of the storm had passed, and was headed for neighbouring Argentina.

Curanilahue, about 600km (373 miles) south of the capital Santiago, has been hard hit as the Curanilahue and Las Ranas rivers overflowed after the area received 350mm (13.8 inches) of rain in just hours \u2013 more than in 2023 as a whole. About 2,000 houses in the area were damaged. President Gabriel Boric, in a message from Sweden where he was on an official visit, warned that the rains \u201cwill continue very strongly\u201d. Earlier on Thursday, before boarding a plane to visit the affected areas, Toha said a state of \u201ccatastrophe\u201d had been declared in five regions to expedite the deployment of resources. SENAPRED said the downpours have affected about 3,300 people, down from an initial estimate of 4,300. In Santiago, which also saw heavy rains, schools were closed for the day and authorities urged people to limit their movements. In the city of Vina del Mar, experts worked to save a 12-storey apartment building at risk of collapse after the rains caused a massive sinkhole underneath it.

Bari, Italy \u2013 Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries are meeting for a three-day summit to discuss global affairs in the southern region of Puglia (Apulia). The event is being held on Thursday in Borgo Egnazia, a luxurious resort surrounded by olive trees in the style of a medieval village and very much loved by celebrities including popstar Madonna. Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the host of this year\u2019s summit, will be welcoming the heads of state of the seven members \u2013 the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom \u2013 as well as the chiefs of the European Council and the European Commission.  As the \u201clike-minded\u201d group tries to shake off its reputation of being a club just for the wealthy West, Italy has extended an invitation to more than 10 other countries for sideline discussions. These include UAE\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed, Algeria\u2019s President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Notable absentees are Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who, according to a list seen by Al Jazeera, had been invited. The timing could not be better for Meloni, who will preside over the summit as Europe\u2019s rising star following her far-right party\u2019s victory at the recent European Parliament elections that saw a turn to the right across the continent. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be heading to the G7 with the strongest government of all,\u201d the prime minister said on her way to Puglia. Africa and the Mediterranean \u2013 two key national security issues \u2013 will feature prominently in the summit. Meloni is expected to expand her flagship foreign policy, the so-called Mattei Plan. The project aims to position Italy as a major energy hub between Europe and the African continent in the hope of boosting growth in Africa and, in turn, curbing immigration to Europe. Support for Ukraine is also top of the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to arrive on the summit\u2019s first day for two sessions dedicated to the war-torn country. The G7\u2019s most anticipated outcome is an agreement over a $50bn loan for Ukraine backed by profits accrued on Russian assets frozen in the West soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. An Italian source told Al Jazeera there was political will to announce a deal at the summit, even if some technical issues need ironing out. Such an agreement, the source said, would send a strong message of unity with Kyiv at a time when Ukrainian soldiers are on the back foot, and Moscow is making steady gains in the east and north of the country. A potential change in the White House in the US\u2019s November elections has added to the urgency. Another session is on the Middle East, where Israel\u2019s war on Gaza is expected to dominate talks. Observers say leaders are likely to reiterate past positions, from calling on Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal laid out by US President Joe Biden, to acknowledging the importance of a two-state solution for peace in the region.

Russia has failed to make any significant gains in its war in Ukraine during the past week, and suffered a number of setbacks on its own soil, in occupied Crimea and occupied Georgia. At the same time, Russia sought to project power far beyond its borders, sending a flotilla to Cuba, which conducted missile drills along the way and threatened to disseminate long-range weapons to Western adversaries. On the ground, Russia\u2019s incursion in Ukraine\u2019s northern Kharkiv region appeared to have stalled, as forces spearheading two separate initiatives in Vovchansk and north of Lyptsi made no new gains. Ukrainian military officials have described that May 10 incursion as an effort to distract their forces from the defence of Chasiv Yar, a key settlement in Donetsk, on the eastern front. Here, Russian forces did make constant incremental gains throughout the past week, but the Khortytsia Group of forces defending this position said Russian forces were not operating inside Chasiv Yar. Visual evidence suggested Russian forces were still 700-800 metres east of the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal, a waterway that runs around the eastern edge of Chasiv Yar. A separate attempted incursion north of Sumy on June 9 advanced about 700m into Ukraine and appeared ineffective since it had \u201cnot established a significant or enduring presence in this area,\u201d according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Ukraine\u2019s regional military administration in Sumy ordered the evacuation of eight villages within 10km (6.2 miles) of the Russian border. A recent change in allied policy towards Ukrainian weapons use appeared to have complicated Russian logistics in the past week. In late May, the United States and Germany joined France and the United Kingdom in allowing Ukraine to use their weapons inside Russia, in response to the new Kharkiv offensive. On Monday, the Ukrainian partisan group Atesh, which operates in occupied Crimea, said Russian authorities had begun to move air defence systems to the Russian border region of Belgorod, \u201cwhich creates a security threat in Crimea, leaving it without proper coverage\u201d. Ukraine used US-made Army Tactical Missiles (ATACMs) to further weaken Crimea\u2019s air defences that day. Its general staff said their forces had destroyed the main radar of an S-400 air defence battery in Dzhankoi, and the radars of S-300 batteries in Yevpatoria and Chernomorsk, all in northern and western occupied Crimea. Without the radar, the accompanying missile launchers cannot target their missiles. Crimean air defence acts as a shield for the Russian region of Krasnodar Krai and the Russian naval port of Novorossiysk immediately to its east, which was considered a relatively safe haven after repeated Ukrainian strikes on the port of Sevastopol in Crimea. But in early June, the Russian Black Sea Fleet moved some 18 ships out of Novorossiysk. Ukrainian navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russian authorities realised the ships were sitting ducks. On Saturday, the Ukrainian Navy reported that seven of those Russian ships were in the Sea of Azov \u2013 possibly to protect the Kerch Bridge, which connects Krasnodar Krai to Crimea. Russia used the bridge on June 8 to transport fuel to Crimea \u2013 something it had not done since March, favouring a ferry crossing next to the bridge instead. But Ukraine used US weapons to hit the Russian side of the Kerch ferry crossing on May 31, as soon as geographic restrictions were lifted, complicating Russian logistics. The bridge\u2019s vulnerability to attack has been known since October 2022, when Ukraine first struck it with a truck bomb, and it proved vulnerable to Ukrainian naval drones last July. In the past few days, Russia has placed barges on either side of the bridge as additional protection from naval drones. Whereas the UK and France have not publicly restricted the use of their weapons anywhere on Russian soil, the US and Germany have allowed their use only in response to incoming fire and only in Kharkiv. The ISW was critical of this policy, saying it had \u201cremoved a maximum of 16 percent of Russia\u2019s ground sanctuary\u201d, compared with the range of territory in Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk regions that could be struck using US-made High Mobility Army Rocket systems (HIMARS), and called on the administration to give Ukraine a free hand. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum that providing Western adversaries with long-range weapons would be a \u201csymmetrical response\u201d to the lifting of Ukraine\u2019s prohibition from striking Russian soil with allied weapons.\u00a0 He also threatened to use nuclear weapons. In addition to the lifting of geographic restrictions, Ukraine is to receive F-16 fighter jets this year. One report said it could expect 60 decommissioned jets from Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. Ukraine, which still operates Soviet aircraft, has said it needs twice that many to protect its airspace, but on June 6 French President Emmanuel Macron announced he will send French Mirage 2000-5 fighters to Ukraine, without specifying how many or when. Ukraine sounded less than thrilled. \u201cLike all modern aircraft, the Mirage 2000 can effectively perform assigned combat missions. It can be both air and ground strikes. The aircraft is quite modern, but the F-16 remains a priority,\u201d said Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Ilya Yevlash the following day. Speaking to French television networks on the eve of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings that ended World War II, Macron also said France would train a battalion of Ukrainian troops (4,500) on French soil. Ukraine does have a free hand when it comes to its own domestically produced weapons, and it continued to use these to strike military and energy targets in Russia, as it has done since the beginning of this year. Ukrainian drones struck refineries in Belgorod and Rostov on June 6. Two days later, its drones struck Russia\u2019s Mozdok military base in North Ossetia, Georgia territory Russia occupied in August 2008. And Ukraine hit a Russian command post in Belgorod with an unspecified weapon on June 9. The most prestigious hit came on June 8. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence (GUR) claimed to have damaged a Russian Sukhoi-57 multirole fighter. It published satellite images purporting to show the plane surrounded by scorch marks on the tarmac at Akhtubinsk airfield in Astrakhan region, 589km (366 miles) from the contact line. The Su-57 is Russia\u2019s most advanced military combat aircraft, and the strike would be the first damage to this type of aircraft in the Ukraine war. \u201cImages dated 8 June reveal craters from the explosion and distinct fire marks caused by the strike,\u201d said GUR. It said Russia has an estimated six Su-57s in active service, with another six under construction. \u201cThere are data that continue to be refined. There is preliminary information that there could be two Su-57 aircraft affected,\u201d said a GUR spokesperson a day later on a telethon. \u201cThere is also information about irretrievable losses and wounded among the personnel of the occupiers.\u201d Ukraine said the planes had been used to launch Kh-59 and Kh-69 missiles into Ukrainian territory. Russia continued to target Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2013 on Friday Ukraine\u2019s air force said it shot down 48 out of 53 Shahed drones Russia launched targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure. It also shot down five X-101\/X-555 missiles. Russia has used combinations of drones and missiles to devastate Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure during the past winter. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday that Russia had damaged or destroyed 73 percent of the country\u2019s power plants. The Financial Times said Russia had reduced Ukraine\u2019s pre-war installed electricity generating capacity of 55GW to just 20GW. Russia, too, was experiencing problems with energy \u2013 and not just from the refineries Ukraine has been knocking offline, which have reportedly reduced refining capacity by at least 14 percent. A Stockholm arbitration court on Wednesday ruled that Germany\u2019s leading gas importer could demand enormous damages from Russia for undelivered gas. The company, Uniper, was in litigation with Russia\u2019s state gas supplier, Gazprom, over who was responsible for the non-delivery of gas through the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which was to have started operating in 2022, when it was blown up by unknown saboteurs. The court ruled that Uniper may cancel its long-term supply contracts with Gazprom and demand 13 billion euros ($14bn) in damages from the Russian company. Gazprom has run into other problems recently. The Financial Times reported that Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping disagreed last month on a sale price for Russian gas to China, with Xi demanding prices near the subsidised domestic Russian rates. That disagreement has stalled the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which Gazprom was to have started building to China. Largely due to the war in Ukraine and the loss of sales to Europe, Gazprom posted a $6.9bn loss last year, its largest in a quarter-century. If the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline does not begin operating in 2029, the FT reported, Gazprom\u2019s profits are forecast to drop by a further 15 percent.

During a Wednesday press conference in Doha, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was less than honest about a United States-proposed Gaza ceasefire deal. During the course of his opening remarks and the question and answer session, Blinken made several statements that are either transparently untrue or deeply misleading. First, Blinken insisted that the three-phased ceasefire deal announced by US President Joe Biden on May 31 was an \u201cIsraeli proposal\u201d and that Israel fully backs it. When asked during the question and answer session whether the US was attempting to put pressure on Israel to accept the proposal, Blinken said there was no need to do so because Israel had already accepted it. But Blinken was being untruthful. Biden proposed the deal because he is desperate to get out from under his disastrous Gaza policy before the start of the Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for August. Biden\u2019s proclamation that it was an \u201cIsraeli proposal\u201d simply isn\u2019t true. In the two weeks since Biden made his announcement, Israeli officials have not come forward and announced their acceptance of the deal. In fact, they\u2019ve done the opposite. Over the past two weeks, Israeli officials have made clear that they oppose the Biden draft proposal. Moreover, Netanyahu and other officials have made clear that Israel intends to continue its war on Gaza, an aim which contradicts the basic terms of Biden\u2019s proposal. On Monday at the United Nations, Israeli representative Reut Shapir Ben-Naftaly could not have been clearer about Israel\u2019s position. She said that Israel\u2019s war aims \u201chave not changed\u201d and that the war \u201cwill continue \u2026 until Hamas military and governing capabilities are dismantled\u201d. She also said that Israel would not \u201cengage in meaningless and endless negotiations\u201d about a permanent ceasefire. Israel\u2019s public positions caused a former top Israeli diplomat, Alon Liel, to proclaim that Israel has \u201cdefinitely not\u201d accepted the \u201cproposal submitted by the Americans\u201d. Indeed, Israel continues to say it is pursuing the \u201ctotal victory\u201d it has sought since the start of the war. Although Israel claims \u201ctotal victory\u201d involves the elimination of Hamas, a more realistic interpretation is that Israel seeks the complete destruction of Gaza and the forced transfer of Palestinians there to Egypt and\/or Jordan. In any case, what is clear is that Israel has no intention of honouring phase two of Biden\u2019s agreement, which calls for a permanent end to fighting. Here, the devil is in the details. The wording in Biden\u2019s proposal gives Israel a way out after phase one. The Biden proposal stipulates that phase two can only be reached upon Israel\u2019s agreement at the end of phase one. If Israel doesn\u2019t agree to move to phase two and chooses to end negotiations, then the ceasefire is off. But, as Israeli officials have made clear, Israel hasn\u2019t agreed even to these very watered down ceasefire terms. Blinken\u2019s second lie pertains to Hamas and its position on the proposal. During the press conference, Blinken indicated that the Biden proposal was \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the deal Hamas proposed on May 6. Blinken went on to blame Hamas for being insincere and \u201ccontinuing to try to change the terms,\u201d including terms that \u201cHamas had previously accepted\u201d. But all of this is also untrue. First, Hamas\u2019s May 6 proposal was quite different from the Biden proposal. It did not give Israel wiggle room to easily exit the agreement after phase one. Also, and importantly, the Hamas proposal called for an end to Israel\u2019s illegal, suffocating blockade on Gaza. Blinken said that Hamas had proposed \u201cnumerous changes\u201d to Biden\u2019s proposal. All Hamas did, however, was attempt to move things closer towards its May 6 proposal, which would lead to an actual end to the war. One significant change that Hamas did introduce \u2013 an Israeli troop withdrawal \u2013 was necessitated by Israel\u2019s taking over of the Philadelphi Corridor on May 30. This is an important fact that Blinken conveniently decided to omit. Third, Blinken said the \u201cwhole world\u201d supports the proposal and that Hamas is the only entity to avoid getting behind it. This is highly misleading. Over the past several months, the US and Israel have rejected and obstructed several serious ceasefire proposals, all of which have been backed by Hamas and the global community. After engaging in this obstruction, the US made its very imperfect proposal on May 31. Countries in the United Nations Security Council voted for it not because it was a great proposal, nor because they thought it was better than previous proposals which they had also voted for. They voted for this proposal precisely because of US obstructionism. Countries know that this proposal is the only game in town, the only opportunity that the US and Israel will allow for at least a temporary cessation. Several countries made their reservations known on Monday. Russia, China, Malta and Algeria, among other global actors, have expressed their reservations. Blinken\u2019s statement that the \u201centire world\u201d stands behind the Biden proposal is deeply misleading. Fourth, Blinken blamed Hamas for holding up the ceasefire for 12 days. During his Wednesday remarks, Blinken mentioned the \u201c12 days\u201d \u2013 which is the time elapsed between Biden\u2019s announcement and Hamas\u2019s response \u2013 a total of five times. Each mention was an attempt by Blinken to blame Hamas for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. For example, Blinken said, \u201cthe reality is as this negotiation is going on, during the 12 days that it took Hamas to respond, the world wasn\u2019t standing still. Gaza wasn\u2019t standing still. People were suffering every single day.\u201d But Blinken is again being untruthful. Biden announced the deal on May 31, but, as\u00a0Sami Al-Arian\u00a0and other analysts have noted, didn\u2019t present a written, detailed draft to Hamas until\u00a0much later. The exact date is unclear, but based on news reports, it appears that as of June 5, Hamas still hadn\u2019t received anything in writing from Biden. It appears they may have finally received a written draft by June 6. The group responded on June 11. That would mean a five-day gap, not the 12 that Blinken misleadingly claimed. Given the apparently significant discrepancies between what Biden announced on May 31 and what he submitted to Hamas in writing, it is not unusual that Hamas needed five days to respond. In any case, attempting to blame Hamas for Palestinian suffering constitutes another US attempt to shield Israel from blame over its mass killings in Gaza. That Blinken would lie is not surprising. Indeed, in the context of Israel, the Palestinians, and Gaza, the Biden administration has a history of untruths. But the sheer amount of lies that Blinken was able to pack into a short press conference is nonetheless astonishing. Recent diplomatic manoeuvring isn\u2019t likely to end the war on Gaza, but it will serve Biden\u2019s domestic aims. At the end of all this posturing, Biden will be able to tell US voters that he tried his best to end the war but that Hamas didn\u2019t allow him to.

Bari, Italy \u2013 Africa is set to be high on Italy\u2019s agenda this year at the Group of Seven (G7) leaders\u2019 meeting, as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni aims to position the country as a key energy hub between Europe and the continent. But whether there is a clear vision and economic resources to do so remains to be seen, experts have warned. A dozen heads of state are expected to attend the three-day forum, which starts Thursday in the southern region of Puglia, to discuss global politics. Africa, climate change and development are up as the first themes of the initial G7 session. Signalling Meloni\u2019s outreach ambitions, a relatively high number of guests from the Global South have been invited to this year\u2019s forum. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, and rising competition with China are expected to dominate talks, but Meloni wants the crown jewel of her foreign policy to feature prominently: the so-called Mattei Plan. The project embodies her vision to project power in Africa and turn Italy into a bridge for gas to be distributed from Africa and the Mediterranean to the rest of Europe, as well as supporting economic growth to stem mass migration from the African continent. But Meloni\u2019s objectives seem to be centred on investment rather than development. She has selected financial institutions, banks and private and state-owned companies for her push. The involvement of NGOs and humanitarian organisations is less prominent. At the G7, experts have said, she will be seeking partnerships, money and legitimacy. The timing could not be better for the prime minister who will be presiding the summit as Europe\u2019s rising star following victory at the recent European Parliament elections. \u201cIt\u2019s about presenting a new strategy appealing to both the electorate and enterprises \u2013 Africa is seen as an opportunity to grow when diversifying energy partners and resources [are] key,\u201d said Maddalena Procopio, a senior policy fellow in the Africa programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cMeloni wants to present Italy as the new European face in Africa and to place emphasis on the continent at the G7 is a smart move because she knows there is an unprecedented global interest in it,\u201d Procopio said. Africa is home to some 30 percent of the world\u2019s mineral reserves, many of which are critical to renewable and low-carbon technologies including solar and electric vehicles. It also stores 8 percent of the world\u2019s natural gas, according to the UN. Such resources are key as Western nations try to wean themselves off Russian gas after Moscow invaded Ukraine. Since last year, Algeria has accounted for nearly 40 percent of Italy\u2019s gas imports. Some observers say there is also a geopolitical calculus. Italy\u2019s ambition is to step in at a time when competitor France is suffering major setbacks. Italy has a lighter colonial baggage compared with France and aims at striking a tone that is neither paternalistic nor imposing to African partners. Anti-French, anti-American sentiments have been brewing recently across the continent, especially in Francophone Africa where French troops have departed from several countries. Amid growing competition between the Western bloc and the China-Russia front, the EU and US will follow Meloni\u2019s plan with interest, but there is a degree of scepticism about its viability. During an Italy-Africa summit early this year, Meloni fleshed out five areas of investment \u2013\u00a0 energy, agriculture, water, health, and education \u2013 and a few pilot projects. Observers were left unimpressed. \u201cIt was vague and most of the projects presented were a rebranding of some already up and running,\u201d said Bernardo Venturi, head of research and policy at the Agency for Peacebuilding NGO. He said that no additional resources were allocated for the plan \u2013 other than 5 billion euros ($5.38bn) formerly taken from other budgets, and claimed most African partners had not been consulted. Since then, a working group was set up where the foreign ministry and NGOs with decades of experience on the ground were left with a marginal role, he added. \u201cItaly also lacks the economic resources to invest in new projects and has a marginal institutional presence across the continent,\u201d said Venturi, who has closely watched the development of the project. For that, it needs EU member states to financially support it, but Meloni has given a fairly a low degree of responsibility\u00a0 to the foreign ministry, raising questions about its international reach. Further criticism came from rights groups, who said the plan is an attempt to dress up anti-immigration policies as an energy investment scheme. Meloni built up much of her election campaign on promises to address migration. Human rights groups have accused her government of trying to impede the work of search and rescue organisations in the Mediterranean by restricting refugees\u2019 rights to reach its shores. An Italian official who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity dismissed the initiative, saying, \u201cThere is not such a thing as the Mattei Plan, it\u2019s just narrative\u201d.

Here's a breakdown.","date":"2024-06-13T10:04:18Z","content":"Commission of Inquiry accuses Israel and Palestinian groups of war crimes. Here\u2019s a breakdown. A United Nations-backed inquiry has concluded that war crimes have been committed by Israel and by Hamas as well as other Palestinian groups, during the now eight-month conflict. The independent Commission of Inquiry report, released on Wednesday, cover the period from the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7 and Israel\u2019s subsequent war on Gaza, with the period of investigation ending December 31, 2023. Israel is still waging its vicious war on Gaza. The report is unflinchingly graphic, including details of sexual violence, torture and mutilations carried out on unarmed citizens. Here is what it said: Both, it\u00a0accuses both Israel and Palestinian groups. It found the Hamas-led Palestinian fighters who attacked Israel on October 7 committed war crimes, failing to make a distinction between Israeli combatants and non-combatants during their attack. It also found that Israel and its army are committing \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d in Gaza, including\u00a0\u201cextermination; murder, gender persecution targeting Palestinian men and boys; forcible transfer; and torture and inhuman and cruel treatment\u201d. Israel has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in Gaza in an assault that shows no sign of stopping. The report also found an explosion of violence across the occupied West Bank since October 7 and Israeli government efforts to arm and mobilise an already radicalised settler movement.      According to the report, the Hamas-led fighters, including members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, carried out waves of attacks against Israeli civilians, including sexual and gender-based violence as well as murder and torture. Children, teenagers and the elderly were also targeted. The report notes the subsequent \u201cdesecration of corpses by burning, mutilation and decapitation\u201d as well as \u201cthe sexualized desecration of both male and female corpses\u201d. Investigators could not determine if rape had been carried out during the attack due to their inability to access and interview witnesses and victims. Israel\u2019s response to the attack was also criticised, the report finding that the Israeli army used its Hannibal Directive \u2013 a military that allows the army to do anything to stop the capture of Israelis, even kill them. The Israeli military killed at least 14 Israeli civilians because of the directive, the report found. Israel initially said it would assault Gaza to retrieve the captives taken there and to destroy Hamas\u2019s ability to govern. Instead, soon a total siege was imposed on the enclave as collective punishment of the people\u00a0Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called \u201chuman animals\u201d, the report said. \u201cGiven Israel\u2019s repeated assertion that militants are \u2018embedded\u2019 within the civilian population, the Commission considers these statements indicate that the Israeli Government has given [the Israeli Security Forces] blanket authorisation to target civilian locations widely and indiscriminately in the Gaza Strip,\u201d it continued.  The report also found that widespread sexual and gender-based violence, as well as torture, have all been characteristic of the Israeli response. Men and women were repeatedly forced to strip in public, with the men and boys\u2019 experience filmed and posted online, the Commission concluding that \u201cforced public stripping and nudity and other types of abuse by Israeli military personnel were either ordered or condoned\u201d. What Israel touted as its efforts to \u201cminimise civilian casualties\u201d were also heavily criticised. Instructions to civilians on how to reach \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d were unclear and the time given was insufficient as thousands of starving, injured, and elderly people were forced to walk carrying their entire lives from one spot to another, trying to follow unclear Israeli calculations. Evacuation routes were chaotic, with evacuees stopped and harassed at checkpoints by members of the Israeli military. There are 1.7 million Palestinians displaced within Gaza.      According to the report, requests for information were sent to both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The PA responded positively and provided the Commission with extensive comments on the report\u2019s contents. The Israeli government was uncooperative and failed to respond to six requests for information. The Israeli government has also blocked the Commission\u2019s investigators from accessing medical staff within Israel. Hamas military wing has rejected all accusations that its forces committed sexual violence against Israeli women on October 7. Israel\u2019s diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva denied the charges in the report in a social media post saying\u00a0that the Commission of Inquiry \u201chas once again proven that its actions are all in the service of a narrow-led political agenda against Israel\u201d.

A second person has died in South Africa this week from the viral infection mpox, says the health ministry, less than 24 hours after it announced the first death. Previously known as monkeypox, mpox is a viral illness transmitted through close contact with infected humans or animals, as well as via materials such as contaminated sheets. In July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency, which lasted for 10 months. On Thursday, South Africa\u2019s government said the second person who died was a 38-year-old man. He was admitted to a hospital in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province with extensive lesions, headache, fatigue, oral ulcers, muscle pain and a sore throat. He tested positive for mpox on Wednesday. \u201cThe patient has unfortunately demised in KZN the same day his test results came back positive,\u201d spokesperson for the national health department Foster Mohale said. The total number of laboratory-confirmed mpox cases stands at six in the country, with two deaths since the first case was recorded five weeks ago. On Wednesday, Health Minister Joe Phaahla had announced the first death, and four more infections. \u201cOne death is too many, especially from a preventable and manageable disease,\u201d Phaahla said, urging those with suspected symptoms to seek medical attention and help trace contacts. The six cases were the first recorded in the country since 2022.      Mpox spreads through close physical contact. Most cases are mild but it can kill. The disease causes painful and scarring lesions, principally to the face, anus and genitals. Common symptoms include a skin rash, fever, headache, muscle aches and swollen lymph nodes, according to the WHO. Mpox was first discovered in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the spread since then mainly limited to certain West and Central African nations. More than 97,000 cases and 186 deaths were reported across 117 countries in the first four months of 2024, according to the WHO. Phaahla, the health minister, said that all those recently infected in South Africa were men in their 30s. Their cases were classified as severe. \u201cOur intention is to obtain a stockpile of Tecovirimat treatment for rapid deployment in case the current situation leads to a wider outbreak,\u201d Phaahla said, referring to an antiviral drug.

Thousands of protesters gathered in the shadow of the country\u2019s domed Congress building on Wednesday, in a demonstration against the proposed austerity measures contained in the wide-reaching bill. But while the day began with street barbecues, picketing and protest songs, tensions rose in the afternoon as debate unfolded inside the congressional building. Riot police armed with helmets, batons and clear, plastic shields arrived to disperse the crowds. They deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, spraying protesters bundled against the winter cold. Local media reported that several opposition lawmakers who were among the crowd, including Juan Manuel Pedrini, had to be transferred to a nearby hospital to treat burns to their eyes and skin. \u201cA sad day for Argentinian democracy,\u201d said a social media account for the Union for the Homeland, a Peronist political party representing the opposition. It declared its \u201cabsolute repudiation of the repression perpetrated by the police\u201d. Milei\u2019s government, meanwhile, pointed to the violent tactics some protesters allegedly used as the afternoon wore on. Officials said 18 people had been detained after reports emerged of rock-throwing and the use of sticks as weapons. A car belonging to the radio station Cadena 3 was also set on fire. Waldo Wolff, the minister of justice and security for the city of Buenos Aires, said one person was even found \u201cwith a grenade\u201d. \u201cThe culture of violence that sets the pace for demonstrations is at an end,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform X. \u201cIn addition to the 18 detained, we are going to take the images to the justice system so that everyone who broke sidewalks [and] burned cars and trash cans will pay.\u201d The administration of President Milei went further, accusing the demonstrators of attempting to overthrow the government and disrupt Congress\u2019s proceedings. \u201cWe went to protect Congress, and they responded with stones and fire,\u201d Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said on X. The social media account for the executive office issued a message as well, congratulating the armed forces \u201cfor their excellent actions in repressing the terrorist groups that, with sticks, stones and even grenades, attempted to perpetrate a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d. The bill at the heart of the unrest \u2014 called the \u201cLey de Bases\u201d or the \u201cLaw of Bases\u201d \u2014 is set to advance Milei\u2019s libertarian agenda, as he attempts to privatise public companies, beef up his executive powers and rev up the economy. In Argentina, annual inflation continues to rise, currently sitting at a rate of nearly 300 percent. As costs spiral, poverty is increasing. Milei says his austerity measures will bring inflation and the country\u2019s sovereign debt under control \u2014 but his critics predict the steep cuts will only worsen the situation. The bill previously passed in Congress\u2019s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, in late April after months of negotiations and a failed vote in February. But political observers believe the bill faces an even higher climb in the opposition-controlled Senate. The Peronist Union for the Homeland holds 33 of the chamber\u2019s 72 seats, compared with seven for Milei\u2019s La Libertad Avanza party.

The UK\u2019s opposition leader Keir Starmer has pledged to make wealth creation the top priority of his government in a pre-election pitch to voters. Speaking ahead of the release of the Labour Party\u2019s election manifesto on Thursday, Starmer said he would prioritise economic growth and not raise taxes. \u201cWe will not raise tax on working people. That means no tax rises for income tax, for national insurance, for VAT [value-added tax],\u201d Starmer said on Wednesday during a leaders\u2019 debate hosted by Sky News. \u201cThe manifesto tomorrow will be a manifesto, a plan, for wealth creation,\u201d Starmer added. \u201cNow you may not hear a Labour leader say that very often, but for me, that is the most important thing.\u201d Starmer, a former human rights lawyer-turned-prosecutor, is widely expected to win next month\u2019s election after 14 years of Conservative Party rule. Opinion polls have for months shown centre-left Labour to be leading the Conservatives by about 20 points. Still, Starmer, 61, has sought to assure voters that Labour will govern with a pro-business and pro-growth agenda, after Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s most left-wing leader in decades, presided over its worst performance since 1935 at the last election. As well as pledging not to raise personal taxes, Labour has ruled out raising corporation tax and said its plans do not require a hike in capital gains tax, although it has not committed to leaving the rate unchanged. \u201cI want to do things differently. I want to grow our economy. I accept that previous Labour leaders have sort of pulled the tax lever every single time and driven up spending,\u201d Starmer said. The UK has been among the worst-performing major economies in recent years. The country slipped into recession in the last three months of 2023, with gross domestic product (GDP) declining 0.3 percent, following a 0.1 percent contraction in the previous quarter. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has forecast the UK to grow 0.4 percent this year, slower than any other G7 economy apart from Germany.

Argentina\u2019s upper house has narrowly passed a controversial bill key to libertarian President Javier Milei\u2019s economic reform plans as thousands of protesters clashed with police in the streets. Senators voted 37 to 36 late on Wednesday to give provisional approval to the plan, embarking on an all-night marathon sitting, extending into the following day ahead of votes on each article of the package, which includes radical measures on privatisation and tax breaks for investors. The Senate had been divided down the middle over the bill, which was eventually decided by a tie-breaking vote from the head of the chamber, Vice President Victoria Villarruel. \u201cToday, there are two Argentinas,\u201d Villarruel said at the session. \u201cA violent Argentina that sets a car on fire, throws rocks and debates the exercise of democracy, and another Argentina with workers waiting with great pain and sacrifice for the change that they voted for.\u201d As the senators voted, thousands of protesters poured into the streets, burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails as hundreds of federal security forces pushed back with rounds of tear gas and water cannon. Seven people, including five lawmakers, were treated at hospital after being pepper-sprayed, according to the Ministry of Health. Dozens of others received medical attention at the scene. At least 10 people were arrested and nine police officers were injured, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Security, quoted by the AFP news agency. The vote delivered a major boost to Milei, a self-declared \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d, whose efforts to overhaul the government and economy have run into tough resistance in Argentina\u2019s opposition-dominated Congress, which he has dubbed a \u201cnest of rats\u201d. A political outsider with just two years of experience as a lawmaker, his three-year-old party, Liberty Advances, holds only 15 percent of seats in the lower house and 10 percent in the Senate. \u201cTonight is a triumph for the Argentine people and the first step toward the recovery of our greatness,\u201d Milei posted on X, calling his bills \u201cthe most ambitious legislative reform of the last 40 years\u201d.      The bill is central to Milei\u2019s plans to overhaul an embattled economy. Executive measures imposed so far, which include slashing subsidies and firing thousands of public sector employees, have deepened a recession, increased poverty to 55 percent and sent annual inflation surging 300 percent. Right-wing and left-wing lawmakers clashed over various parts of the 238-article reform bill, which includes the declaration of a one-year state of economic emergency allowing Milei to disband federal agencies and the privatisation of about a dozen public companies. Other measures deal with reducing access to minimum retirement allowances and weakening labour protections \u2013 slammed by left-wing opponents as a licence to fire workers. The provisions also envision tax, customs and foreign exchange incentives to encourage investment in the country racked by economic crisis. Prior to the bill\u2019s preliminary Senate approval, opposition lawmakers took to the floor claiming it would reverse decades of progress. Opposition senator Mariano Recalde said the labour reforms in particular \u201ctake us back to the last century when the employee had no labour rights\u201d. The bill was passed by the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, in April. If approved in a full vote by the Senate, the measure will return to the lower house for a final green light. The measure is opposed by a broad swath of society, including social organisations, left-wing political parties, retirees, teachers and labour unions. Protesters fear the bill will leave them further exposed to rising unemployment and consumer prices. \u201cArgentine people\u2019s lives are at play,\u201d said protester and social leader Luis D\u2019Elia. \u201cThis poison has failed several times in Argentina, and we won\u2019t allow this to carry on.\u201d Miriam Rajovitcher, a 54-year-old teacher, said if the law passed, she would lose many of her labour and pension rights. \u201cI am so much worse off,\u201d she said.

Tens of thousands of men in vibrant attire, henna-dyed beards and bright headgear thronged around the Muslim shrine nestled at the base of a mountain, to pay their respects last week. Worshippers raised their hands and cried out their wishes. Some also tied multicoloured threads around the trees at the shrine, which represented their prayers. The shrine to Mian Nizamuddin Kiyanwi has its origins in the 19th century and provides free meals all year to devotees, most of them from Kashmir\u2019s nomadic pastoral community. Devotees believe their wishes are granted at the shrine. Kiyanwi, originally from Kashmir, migrated to the Hazara region of modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan during the late 19th century. There, he was mentored by a Sufi saint and later returned to Kashmir to preach Islam. After he died, the shrine was built as a mark of respect towards him \u2013 a manifestation of the region\u2019s unique ties with Sufism. Abdul Razaq, a devotee, said that he has been visiting the shrine since he was six and feels blessed by paying obeisance there. \u201cI remember as a kid we had to travel a lot by foot, but things have changed, and today we can reach the shrine in a day,\u201d he said. Another devotee, Mohammad Farooq, who is visually impaired, said: \u201cIt would have been great if I could see things for myself, but I find peace when I visit the shrine.\u201d Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety, is a Muslim-majority region. Rebel groups have been fighting since 1989 for Kashmir\u2019s independence, a goal supported by a large number of Muslims in the disputed territory. The region has remained embroiled in civil strife for decades and the shrine, including hundreds of others strewn around its landscape, has been and continues to be, far more than a mere spiritual retreat for Muslims. Many worshippers find these shrines a rare space far removed from unrelenting political tensions in the region.

The United States Supreme Court has rejected a bid to curb access to a drug used in abortions, ending an attempt by abortion opponents to limit access to the procedure. In a 9-0 ruling on Thursday, the justices overturned a lower court\u2019s decision last year to limit access to the drug mifepristone, used in more than half of abortions in the country. The Food and Drug Administration had taken steps in 2016 and 2021 to ease how the pill is prescribed and distributed. The pill, given FDA regulatory approval in 2000, is used in more than 60 percent of US abortions, according to a recent study. The conservative-dominated Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a key ruling that granted the right to abortion, sparking outrage from women\u2019s rights advocates and Democrats. Thursday\u2019s decision has come months before the US elections, where reproductive rights have been a top theme in the campaign. Three of the top court\u2019s justices who overturned Roe v Wade \u2013 the 1973 legal precedent that enshrined the right to abortion \u2013 had been appointed by former President Donald Trump, who is set for a rematch with US President Joe Biden in November. Since the revoking of the guarantee of abortion rights at the federal level, dozens of Republican-led states have imposed bans and severe restrictions on access to the procedure.      In the past two years, Democrats have stressed abortion rights and reproductive freedom to hit out against Republicans. Biden welcomed the top court\u2019s decision on the abortion pill on Thursday, stressing that the ruling \u201cdoes not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states\u201d. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear: attacks on medication abortion are part of Republican elected officials\u2019 extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Biden said in a statement. The Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs behind the lawsuit challenging mifepristone lacked the necessary legal standing to pursue the case, which required that they show they have been harmed in a way that can be traced to the FDA. Abortion is a prominent political issue in the US. For decades, restricting abortions has been a top goal for conservative religious groups. Liberals, who oppose government restrictions on abortion, argue that the procedure is part of a woman\u2019s healthcare, personal choices and bodily autonomy. Trump, who enjoys wide popularity amongst conservative Christians who oppose abortion, said in April he would not sign a federal abortion ban into law if elected. Last year, he called a six-week abortion ban in Florida a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d.

Violence against children caught in multiplying and escalating conflicts reached \u201cextreme levels\u201d in 2023 with an unprecedented number of killings and injuries, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, a United Nations report has found. Children were \u201ckilled and maimed in unprecedented numbers in devastating crises\u201d, notably in the Gaza Strip, according to the report released by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday. The annual Children and Armed Conflict\u00a0report found \u201ca shocking 21 percent increase in grave violations\u201d against children under the age of 18 in an array of conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burkina Faso, Somalia and Syria. The UN verified 30,705 violations against children in 2023, affecting more than 15,800 boys and 6,250 girls. Some were subjected to multiple violations, the report said. While armed groups were responsible for almost 50 percent of the grave violations, it said, \u201cgovernment forces were the main perpetrator of the killing and maiming of children, attacks on schools and hospitals, and the denial of humanitarian access.\u201d      \u00a0 For the first time, the UN report put Israeli forces on its blacklist of countries that violate children\u2019s rights over the killing and maiming of children and attacks on schools and hospitals. It listed the armed groups Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad for the first time as well. In Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory in 2023, the report said, 5,698 grave violations against children were attributed to Israeli forces, 116 to Hamas, 58 to unidentified perpetrators, 51 to Israeli settlers, 21 to Islamic Jihad, 13 to Palestinian individuals and one to Palestinian Authority security forces. It said the process of verifying the attribution of 2,051 other violations was ongoing. The Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent war on Gaza have led to a surge in grave violations against children, especially from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas in Gaza, the report said. In the Gaza Strip alone, the report said, the UN verified the killings of 2,141 Palestinian children. It said, however, that about 9,100 children were reported killed in the territory \u201cand verification is ongoing\u201d. Overall in the Palestinian territories, it said, \u201csome 19,887 Palestinian children were reported killed or maimed and the reports are pending verification.\u201d The magnitude of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza \u201cand the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip have been unprecedented\u201d, Guterres said, reiterating calls for Israel to abide by international law and ensure civilians are not targeted and that excessive force is not used. The UN chief said he is \u201cappalled by the dramatic increase and unprecedented scale and intensity of grave violations against children in the Gaza Strip, Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite my repeated calls for parties to implement measures to prevent grave violations\u201d. Sudan \u2013 where a war between rival generals has been raging since April 2023 \u2013 witnessed \u201ca staggering 480 percent increase in grave violations against children\u201d, the report said. The Sudanese military and the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces were added to the blacklist for killing and injuring youngsters and attacking schools and hospitals. The paramilitary was also cited for recruiting and using children in military operations and for rape and sexual violence. By the end of 2023, Guterres said, the UN had verified 1,721 grave violations against 1,526 children in Sudan. \u201cI am appalled by the dramatic increase in grave violations,\u201d he said, especially the recruitment, killing and maiming of children as well as sexual violence and attacks on schools and hospitals.      A growing civil conflict in Myanmar also saw a 123 percent increase in grave violations against children, and the Myanmar armed forces, related militias and seven armed groups were included on the blacklist. The report said the UN verified 2,799 grave violations against 2,093 children, including 238 killings and 623 injuries attributed to the military and its allied militias. The UN kept the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups on its blacklist for a second year over the killing and maiming of children in Ukraine and attacks on schools and hospitals there. The UN verified the killing of 80 Ukrainian children and maiming of 419 by Russian forces and their affiliates last year, mostly from explosive weapons, the report said. Virginia Gamba, the secretary-general\u2019s special representative on children and armed conflict, said one of the \u201cdisturbing\u201d trends found was the continued use of schools and hospitals for military purposes by parties to conflict. \u201cI urge all parties to conflict to stop the military use of schools and to ensure hospitals retain their protected status,\u201d Gamba said, speaking to reporters at the UN headquarters in New York. She said the UN reported 5,205 verified incidents of the denial of humanitarian access to children, which is \u201can unacceptably high figure, representing a 32 percent increase over previous years\u201d.

The current international system that was put in place in the aftermath of the Second World War is struggling to address the many challenges and issues the world is facing today. Driven by the interests and desires of a specific set of states, it is fuelling conflict and hindering peace, stability and prosperity across the globe. After the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, the world has entered a new tumultuous era in which the international community came face to face with a new set of challenges to peace and stability. Modern era necessitates collaboration at both regional and global levels, with a greater involvement of global actors in problem-solving. However, the Ukraine-Russia war, Israel\u2019s attacks on Palestine, and numerous other conflicts highlight the ineffectiveness of international actors in addressing regional issues and their lack of resolve to find solutions. The global influence of international organisations is in decline. This is because these organisations have failed to recognise the nature of the multipolar modern world that began to emerge at the turn of the century. It is important to acknowledge that the international system cannot be shaped solely by a few superpowers and their political and ideological concerns. It is impossible to imagine a world system in which\u00a0the interests and benefits of certain powers are prioritised at the expense of exploiting other countries and peoples. International organisations and the countries that dominate them must recognise this reality and adapt their strategies accordingly. The global system that was put in place after the Second World War is on the verge of collapse, yet it seems impossible to create a system that aligns with the modern era. It is crucial for leading international organisations, initiatives to promptly assume responsibility for constructing a system that aligns with the requirements of the current era. Being an international organisation, the G7 is a group of countries that share common values and principles and\u00a0strive to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights on a global scale. Given the recent international crises and conflicts, it is necessary to reconsider and discuss the G7\u2019s performance in meeting its responsibilities and how its decisions have been received on international platforms. The G7 does not have the authority to make binding decisions, however, in the current landscape, when even the functions and operations of international organisations \u2013 which are supposedly capable of making binding decisions \u2013 are being scrutinised, the G7 cannot avoid these questions. The theme of this year\u2019s summit, which will be attended by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye, as a special guest, has been set as \u201crules-based international system.\u201d The discussions at the three-day summit, will focus on the defence of the rules-based international system among other pressing issues of our time, from the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East, to food security and migration. The theme of the summit is highly appropriate because these days certain states are blatantly violating the rules, norms and standards the current international order has supposedly been built upon and is guarding. Despite this theme, it is crucial to underscore the unfortunate reality that\ncertain states in today\u2019s world blatantly violate the norms that the international system has adopted and built upon. Israel has slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent people in Gaza in a matter of months, eventually bombing even Rafah , the location it had previously designated as the only \u201csafe zone\u201d. Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and other cities amount to a blatant war crime. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has consistently highlighted the need to put an end to Israel\u2019s reckless attacks for months now. As There is a growing global acceptance of the notion that Israel is shielded by the international system rather than being prevented. There is no denying that international actors, especially the G7, have failed to oppose Israel\u2019s actions, which disregard all laws, principles, and values The international system failed to produce a binding call for a ceasefire for many months as Israel slaughtered thousands of women and children. It took repeated mass protests and a powerful uprising of young people at university campuses for the leaders of the G7 to make such a call. The global outcry and revolts against Israel\u2019s strikes serve as a stark reminder that those who support Israel will be remembered with deep shame. These leaders have announced their full support for the ceasefire plan put forward by US President Joe Biden on May 31. However, it is unclear whether this appeal, and the support it has received from the G7, will be able to deter Israel from continuing its war on Palestine. The G7 and other international actors are expected, and required, to do more. It is essential to restructure this system and devise methods to establish a new framework that prioritises the rights of the oppressed over the interests of the powerful. The dysfunction and silence of the international actors in the crises and conflicts that have been taking place in recent years highlight the significance and relevance of our President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s statements, \u201cThe World is Bigger than Five\u201d and \u201cA Fairer World is Possible.\u201d He strongly values and supports T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s endeavours for global peace. The leading role T\u00fcrkiye played in the efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war and to resolve the grain crisis that stemmed from that conflict speaks to this determination. T\u00fcrkiye remains committed to promoting regional and global peace, stability, and crisis resolution in the face of growing challenges of our times, from irregular migration and climate change to international terrorism, and disrupted supply chains.

Washington, DC \u2013 The vice presidency in the United States does not come with much power, yet the names of vice presidential nominees appear on the ballot, yard signs and campaign merchandise next to the main candidates for president. Vice presidents can play an outsized role in the White House beyond the narrow authorities granted by the US Constitution. And as candidates, they can help carry the message of their campaign and boost it. This year, President Joe Biden Biden is expected to stick with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. Former President Donald Trump is set to announce his VP pick during or shortly before the Republican National Convention next month. The VP is elected as part of the presidential ticket. So, if people vote for Biden\u2019s re-election as president, they indirectly elect Harris for another four-year term as VP. As the campaign season heats up, Al Jazeera looks at the VP position in the US and how vice presidential nominees are chosen. Christopher Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton who has written two books about vice presidential candidates, said the VP has a \u201cvery limited set of responsibilities\u201d according to the constitution. \u201cThe VP takes over for the president if something happens \u2013 death, resignation or even in case of temporary incapacity. That\u2019s the big one,\u201d Devine told Al Jazeera. The vice president also casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate \u2013 something that Harris did regularly in the first two years of Biden\u2019s presidency when the chamber was split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. The vice president is also the president of the Senate, but VPs have largely stopped presiding over legislative proceedings \u2013 a mostly ceremonial role \u2013 in past decades. Nowadays vice presidents act as presidential advisers. They are expected to be the \u201clast person in the room\u201d before the president makes major decisions, Devine said. \u201cThey also play other roles, like being a liaison to Congress, helping to negotiate on legislative matters,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. \u201cOf course, they have some role in foreign policy \u2013 meeting with foreign heads of states or doing diplomatic missions, attending funerals and the like. So there\u2019s lots that vice presidents do. But most of what they do is not required by the constitution.\u201d Modern US history has seen powerful vice presidents \u2013 like Dick Cheney, especially during George W Bush\u2019s first term \u2013\u00a0 as well as ones who had a low profile and were not seen as pivotal to their administration, such as Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s former VP. Devine said the president ultimately shapes the role of the vice president. \u201cIt\u2019s really up to the individual presidents. So vice presidents can be used as a great asset to advise the president on important matters. They could also be pushed to the side,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. Lindsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian, said another factor that determines vice presidents\u2019 level of influence is their own experience and relationships. For example, Cheney had served as a defence secretary, congressman and White House chief of staff. \u201cThey need to have something that they can bring to the table in a way that allows them to call on their expertise and connections in order to make an impact,\u201d Chervinsky said of vice presidents. Unlike candidates for president, VP candidates do not run in party primaries. They are chosen after the presidential nominee is determined. Presidential candidates pick their own running mates who then get the official nomination during their party\u2019s convention. Devine said candidates usually start with a long list of candidates and then start narrowing it down after rounds of interviews and background checks. \u201cThe vetting process is incredibly invasive because they\u2019re trying to find out if there are any skeletons in the closet that could come out about the vice presidential candidate during the campaign,\u201d Devine said. \u201cSo they ask for tax records, medical records, they do interviews with people who have worked with the candidates, with family members. They want to know everything.\u201d Chervinsky said candidates typically want their VP pick to be a good public speaker to advance the campaign\u2019s message; being an \u201cattack dog\u201d who can effectively rebuke opponents also helps. \u201cThey\u2019re also usually looking for someone who is different from them in some way,\u201d Chervinsky added. The considerations could include race, age, gender and experience, to help with so-called ticket-balancing, which is meant to broaden the appeal of the campaign. For example, Biden picked Harris \u2013 a Black woman who is considerably younger than him. Barack Obama, a first-term senator at the time, chose Biden, who had been in the Senate for 35 years. Devine said beyond electoral politics, candidates also look for a capable governing partner. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at who can help win the election, but they\u2019re also looking at long term who can help govern once in office,\u201d he said. Both Devine and Chervinsky said VP nominees do not make or break campaigns. \u201cTo the extent they matter, it\u2019s by influencing how people see the presidential candidates\u2019 judgement,\u201d said Devine. \u201cDo they make responsible decisions or not?\u201d Trump had fallen out with his former VP after Pence refused to use his ceremonial role of counting the electoral college votes in Congress to reverse Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Trump is looking for someone who is loyal to him above all other things, including the constitution,\u201d Chervinsky said. She added that he may choose a woman or a person of colour as his running mate to appeal to those subsets of voters. Trump\u2019s rumoured VP picks include Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Senator Tim Scott, Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Scott is the only Black Republican in the US Senate. \u201cIdeally, he should be looking for someone who could be the responsible governing party partner, but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s generally how his considerations are made,\u201d Chervinsky said of Trump.

Wikipedia editors clash over the recent Israeli raid in the central Gaza refugee camp. A fierce \u201cedit war\u201d has broken out on Wikipedia over a page dedicated to a deadly Israeli raid in the Nuseirat refugee camp near Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on the morning of June 8. The bloody attack \u2013 ostensibly to free four Israeli captives held there \u2013 killed nearly 300 displaced people and injured more than 700, overwhelming the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Now, the Israeli raid has become the focus of a heated editing dispute on Wikipedia, which has been forced to restrict editing access to the page dedicated to the incident. This is what we know about the creation of the Wikipedia page and the spiralling online war it has triggered: The Israeli raid on Nuseirat grabbed global headlines due to the freeing of the four Israeli captives \u2013 Noa Argamani, 25; Almog Meir Jan, 21; Andrey Kozlov, 27; and Shlomi Ziv, 40 \u2013 who had been taken by Hamas from a music festival during the October 7 attacks on southern Israel. To explain what happened during the raid and rescue, a Wikipedia editor known only by the username \u201cGalamore\u201d\u00a0created an article dedicated to the incident. Wikipedia allows editors to remain anonymous with their names and countries of origin hidden. However, it does not guarantee that an editor\u2019s identity cannot be discovered by means outside its control. Molly White, an American software engineer and technology researcher, who has been a Wikipedia editor for the past 18 years, editing mostly political pages, told Al Jazeera: \u201cSome argue that anonymity actually helps because, based on a person\u2019s personal identity, you\u2019re not assuming things about them that might be accurate or not. However, she added: \u201cI think it can be challenging if you don\u2019t know much about a person to evaluate biases that they might have, where they\u2019re coming from, their level of expertise\u201d. After its creation, the article on the Nuseirat raid was edited 627 times by 103 users in just one week. This is an unusually high number of changes made to a single article on Wikipedia. By comparison, the Wikipedia page about the October 7 Hamas attacks has been edited 1,705 times by 368 people over the course of eight months. As is common practice when an \u201cedit war\u201d breaks out, Wikipedia administrators quickly locked the page, allowing access to only a few select editors. For anyone else trying to access the page to make changes to it, a notice appears stating \u201conly extended confirmed users and administrators can edit it\u201d. A registered editor becomes an \u201cextended confirmed user\u201d once their account has existed for 30 days and once they have made at least 500 edits. The article\u2019s creator, Galamore, has been registered as a Wikipedia editor since December 25, 2023, and has made 1,186 edits on different Wikipedia articles, largely those with profiles of Israeli personalities, including the footballer Yehezkel Chazom, the board game designer Ephraim Hertzano and chess master Moshe Aba Blass. According to Wikipedia, making more than 1,000 edits puts an editor in the top 0.1 percent of Wikipedia editors in terms of number of edits. An edit war happens when two or more editors persistently change each other\u2019s contributions to an article, causing a repetitive cycle of reversions. This is also known as \u201cvandalism\u201d by users of Wikipedia and includes the \u201cdeliberately disruptive or malicious editing\u201d of any page. This might include deleting content or changing it so it becomes intentionally biased, libellous, offensive or degrading. Edit wars are not uncommon on Wikipedia pages. White said: \u201cThis actually happens all the time. It\u2019s particularly common with things that happened recently like breaking news topics.\u201d White said an edit war had broken out on a page she was involved in editing about the January 6 Capital riots in Washington, DC in 2020. \u201cThere was a huge, months-long argument over what that article should be titled, whether it should be the January 6 \u2018insurrection\u2019 or \u2018riots\u2019 or \u2018attack\u2019 on the Capitol.\u201d According to Wikipedia\u2019s neutrality policy, pages should be written from a neutral point of view \u201cwithout editorial bias\u201d. It operates a set of monitoring tools that can alert it if an edit war appears to have broken out. Wikipedia users can also add a \u201cdispute tag\u201d to a page, indicating that the neutrality of an article has been called into question. This may trigger a wider discussion among Wikipedia\u2019s staff on how to resolve the contentious topic and placing the page in \u201cprotection mode\u201d \u2013 restricting editing access to certain editors only \u2013 until the issue has been resolved. These are some of the key changes that were made to the article in its first 50 hours.

Environmental and social justice advocates in Canada have welcomed a new bill that pledges to develop a national strategy to prevent and address the effects of environmental racism. In a statement on Friday, the Canadian Coalition for Environmental and Climate Justice (CCECJ) said passage of Bill C-226 this week would help communities better understand the scale of the problem and lay out strategies for how to tackle it. The bill passed a third reading in the Senate on Thursday and is now expected to achieve \u201croyal assent\u201d, the last step in the legislative process. \u201cWe know the stories about where and how environmental racism exists in Canada. The formal data on these realities is incomplete, and therefore, there is a lack of understanding about how real this problem is,\u201d said Ingrid Waldron, CCECJ\u2019s co-founder and co-director. \u201cData collection and analysis will be a critical starting point in the strategy required by the Environmental Justice Strategy Act. The consequences of inaction on environmental racism would be ongoing negative impacts on people\u2019s health and wellbeing.\u201d Environmental racism refers to the disproportionate siting of hazardous projects and polluting industries among populations of colour and Indigenous communities. Over the past decades, examples in Canada have included mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows First Nation in northern Ontario, the building of major oil and gas pipelines on unceded, Indigenous lands, and the placement of landfills near historic African-Canadian communities on the east coast. I am pleased to share that the federal Environmental Racism\/Justice private members bill (Bill C-226) was approved at Senate yesterday. It becomes the first environmental justice law in Canada. Statement from my organizations ENRICH and the CCECJhttps:\/\/t.co\/pWN7z7NOMy \u2014 Dr. Ingrid Waldron (@ingrid_waldron) June 14, 2024  Advocates have spent years urging the Canadian government to take action on the issue, the effects of which continue to be felt in communities across the country. Janelle Nahmabin, of Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Ontario,\u00a0told Al Jazeera in 2021 about how growing up in one of Canada\u2019s most heavily industrialised areas \u2013 known as \u201cChemical Valley\u201d \u2013 has affected her and her community. The pollution residents are exposed to every day has harmed their relationship with the land, she said, which in turn \u201cdisconnects Indigenous people from their culture, because the land is a part of our identity\u201d. In 2020, a United Nations special rapporteur also found a \u201cprevalence of discrimination in Canada\u2019s laws and policies regarding hazardous substances and wastes is clear\u201d. \u201cThere exists a pattern in Canada where marginalized groups, and Indigenous peoples in particular, find themselves on the wrong side of a toxic divide, subject to conditions that would not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada,\u201d the expert said in a report (PDF) to the UN Human Rights Council. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals had promised in their 2021 party platform to pass legislation requiring the environment minister to \u201cexamine the link between race, socio-economic status, and exposure to environmental risk\u201d. Trudeau\u2019s government supported Bill C-226 on environmental racism, with Steven Guilbeault, the minister of environment and climate change, saying in February that \u201cenvironmental protection should not change depending on who you are or where you live\u201d. \u201cDecision-making should ensure equal opportunity to all and avoid discriminating underrepresented groups. This national engagement will help us meaningfully and collectively reflect on environmental justice and racism,\u201d Guilbeault said in a statement.      Bill C-226 \u2013 put forward by Green Party leader Elizabeth May \u2013 requires the minister to \u201cdevelop a national strategy to promote efforts across Canada to advance environmental justice and to assess, prevent and address environmental racism\u201d. It also says the minister must work with interested parties, including Indigenous communities, and then submit a report to Canada\u2019s Parliament within two years of the bill\u2019s final passage, laying out the national strategy. \u201cThe passage of Bill C-226 represents a commitment to addressing the long-standing and deeply entrenched issue of environmental racism in Canada,\u201d May of the Green Party said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThis legislation is a testament to the power of collective action and the importance of ensuring that all voices, especially those of marginalized communities, are heard and respected in our environmental policies.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Alexander Durie","title":"Basket Pour Toutes: Fighting against France\u2019s sports and Olympics hijab ban","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/sports\/2024\/6\/13\/basket-pour-toutes-fighting-against-frances-sports-and-olympics-hijab-ban","description":"Ahead of Paris 2024, France\u2019s secularism rule forces female Muslim basketballers to choose between faith and the game.","date":"2024-06-13T13:13:39Z","content":"Ahead of Paris 2024, France\u2019s secularism rule is forcing female Muslim basketball players to choose between faith and the game. Paris, France \u2013\u00a0Diaba Konate was a rising star in French basketball. Called up by the French Federation of Basketball (FFBB) at 17, she went on to play in the national youth teams in three major tournaments, reaching the finals of the U18 European Championship and the Youth Olympic Games in 2018, and winning a gold medal at the 2019 World Beach Games. At the time, the sky was the limit. She moved to the United States on a full scholarship to play with UC Irvine, surpassing 1,000 points in her collegiate career after scoring a season-high 20 against UC Santa Barbara in February 2023. Now 24, Konate dreams of playing for France again, but it has become a trickier proposition. What\u2019s stopping Konate from another national call-up isn\u2019t her potential \u2013 it\u2019s that two years ago, she started wearing a hijab, a headscarf worn by many Muslim women to cover the hair and neck. \u201cI never thought it would be a big hindrance\u201d, Konate told Al Jazeera, recalling how little changed when she started wearing it in the US at 22. But when she wanted to play in a tournament in France that summer, match organisers told her she could only do it if she took off her hijab. She felt \u201chumiliated\u201d, and later discovered that this was part of new FFBB regulations that forbid players from wearing \u201cany equipment with a religious or political connotation\u201d. Konate felt \u201cabandoned\u201d by the FFBB and by many of her former national coaches, who never contacted her after Article 9.3 banning headscarves was implemented in December 2022. Now, Konate has turned to activism to campaign with a collective called Basket Pour Toutes (Basketball For All) that includes mostly young hijab-wearing Muslim women in France who love basketball. Together, they are defying a hijab ban in basketball and across French sports. Their campaign is gaining momentum before the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera announced last September that French athletes wearing a hijab will be banned from competing. Currently, any athlete wearing a hijab will be allowed to compete at Paris 2024 \u2013 except if they\u2019re French. Timothee Gauthierot is a basketball club coach in the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Sec \u2013 he is the co-founder of Basket Pour Toutes. He said that even before this nationwide ban, there were very few hijab-wearing girls who dreamed of becoming professional athletes in France because \u201cthere is so much discrimination\u201d against them. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow them to reach that level\u201d, he said. Human rights experts have said the hijab ban in French basketball is part of a trend of policymakers \u201cweaponising\u201d France\u2019s tradition of la\u00efcit\u00e9 (secularism) to exclude Muslim women and girls from French society, drawing parallels with laws to ban the headscarf and later the abaya (loose-fitting, long-sleeved robe) in public schools, in 2004 and in 2023, respectively. Campaigners have repeatedly pressured the FFBB to overturn Article 9.3, which was implemented without consultation from basketball clubs. Several sources told Al Jazeera that the FFBB introduced new regulations after French senators voted to ban the hijab in sporting competitions in January 2022. This set a precedent as attempts by a collective of Muslim women footballers to allow the hijab in French football were struck down. But Rim-Sarah Alouane, a legal expert on religious freedom, said these regulations \u201cdisproportionately impact Muslim women, thus amounting to indirect discrimination\u201d. She added that \u201cthe principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 is meant to ensure state neutrality in religious matters, not to suppress religious expression\u201d. Paris 2024 will be the first Olympic Games where human rights provisions are included in its Host City Contract. The contract states that Paris 2024 intends to \u201cguarantee respect for the human rights of all populations placed under its responsibility during the organisation\u201d. Ahead of the Olympics, Basket Pour Toutes is pushing for both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to intervene against France\u2019s hijab ban. FIBA itself had a hijab ban until 2017, when it was overturned after an advocacy campaign. Meanwhile, the IOC allows athletes to wear headscarves in its competitions, but has not responded to letters by Amnesty International, FairSquare and the Sport and Rights Alliance calling for it to ensure France allows its hijab-wearing athletes to play sports. For these reasons, Shireen Ahmed, an award-winning journalist focused on Muslim women in sports, said that these Olympics are the \u201cbiggest case of sportswashing\u201d, as France claims to protect human rights while \u201cbeing anti-Muslim in its own backyard\u201d. This issue is \u201call about choice\u201d Ahmed said, describing how this ban relates to issues around women\u2019s bodily autonomy and shows an attempt by policymakers to dictate what women can or cannot wear. \u201cOur objection is not with la\u00efcit\u00e9 [secularism], it\u2019s that it\u2019s unevenly applied,\u201d she said, noting how male athletes who wear a religious cross do not face the same scrutiny. Meanwhile, the French Federation of Basketball\u2019s ban is having harsh effects on female Muslim athletes in France. December 4, 2022 was the date that Helene Ba was first told she was banned from playing basketball. Ba, a 22-year-old law student who grew up in the Paris suburb of Yvelines, recalls that \u201cthe most violent thing\u201d on that match day was that the referee told her coach, instead of her, that she couldn\u2019t play. She said the referee didn\u2019t even mention Article 9.3 \u2013 but instead remarked that wearing a hijab was \u201ca problem of danger\u201d. But, knowing the law, she fought back. \u201cI said that I wouldn\u2019t take off my hijab,\u201d Ba told Al Jazeera. \u201cFIBA [the world basketball body] authorises it, and this was a local match. It\u2019s violent to ask a woman to take off a piece of cloth. This is a legal claim and we have the right to religion and the freedom to practice sports.\u201d But Ba said this didn\u2019t stop people in the stands from asking \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to take it off?\u201d She refused to because \u201cfaith always comes first\u201d, she said. Ba then left the stadium and her team played without her. It was then that Ba realised she had to do something about this, not just for her but for all Muslim athletes in France. \u201cWhen you attack the freedoms of minorities, you attack everyone,\u201d Ba said. \u201cThis [Article 9.3] damages the image of basketball.\u201d Through mutual acquaintances, Ba would meet two pivotal people with whom she would co-found Basket Pour Toutes: coach Timothee Gauthierot and sociologist Haifa Tlili. After conducting more than 150 interviews with Muslim girls in sports in France, Tlili said that \u201cwe do not realise the effects of these traumas\u201d triggered by the hijab ban. \u201cMany girls have told me: \u2018If you take basketball away from me, what do I have left?\u2019,\u201d she said. Badiaga Coumba, a 21-year-old who plays in Gauthierot\u2019s club in Noisy-le-Sec, said that since the FFBB\u2019s ruling took effect, she has felt lost, unsure what to do with herself, and has pretty much given up basketball, although she considers her teammates her \u201csecond family\u201d. But unlike Ba, who was one of the only Muslim athletes at her club and who was left out when the hijab ban was implemented, Coumba is in a very diverse club: almost fully gender equal (rare for most basketball clubs), and with many Black and Muslim players. On a team of 10 girls, there are usually three who wear the hijab, creating a strong sense of solidarity. When referees started telling coaches that hijab-wearing athletes could not even sit on the bench, most French clubs followed the rules \u2013 but not Coumba\u2019s club. The eligible players went on the pitch, placed the ball on the ground, and refused to play. Referees would quickly grasp what was happening, and call off the match. Gauthierot, who has stood by his female athletes when they\u2019ve done this, has faced severe legal reprisals by the FFBB, and even the president of the Paris region, Valerie Pecresse. On October 7, 2023, she posted on X, formerly Twitter, \u201cI call on the State to stop leaving competition referees alone in the face of Islamist attempts to destabilise sport grounds\u201d. After receiving a collective letter from 70 Paris clubs protesting this basketball hijab ban, Pecresse ordered the suspension of \u201cany subsidy to a club violating our charter of la\u00efcit\u00e9\u201d. Since most clubs are dependent on public funds, as many as 20 clubs have been heavily impacted and have had to retract their support. The FFBB has also hit back directly against Gauthierot, fining him 300 euros ($325) and suspending him from all official capacities in basketball for six months from September 2024, in an ongoing case that Gauthierot is legally contesting. \u201cThey say that it [the hijab] can lead to radicalisation, but we really live in harmony,\u201d Gauthierot said. \u201cThey [the FFBB] make decisions without knowing us.\u201d Gauthierot, who is of Guadeloupean origin, cited sports legends who stood up against discrimination as role models, like modern American football\u2019s Colin Kaepernick; or former US runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who gave the Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to lose,\u201d said Gauthierot, who works in IT and volunteers at the local basketball club. \u201cI\u2019d rather do it without discriminating against girls.\u201d Critics of the hijab ban point out that this is happening while France prepares to host the first Olympic Games to reach full gender parity, making the situation even more alarming. \u201cBy proudly claiming that the Games will be \u2018gender equal\u2019, the French authorities are exposing their own hypocrisy of celebrating such alleged advancements while at the same time discriminating against Muslim women and girls through hijab bans in sports,\u201d Amnesty International researcher Anna Blus said. Andrea Florence, director of the Sports & Rights Alliance, highlighted, \u201cIt\u2019s the Olympic principle 6 [of the Olympic Charter] that people should enjoy sports without discrimination of any kind. It\u2019s not about the number of people banned, it\u2019s about those who can\u2019t even be included.\u201d Al Jazeera contacted the FFBB, the French Ministry of Sports, FIBA, and the IOC for comment. Only FIBA replied, stating that \u201cthe headgear is allowed in Official Basketball Competitions, including the Olympic Games, in accordance with the Official Basketball Rules\u201d. It did not specify if it would intervene against the FFBB\u2019s hijab ban. Despite challenging times for the girls from Basket Pour Toutes, they are not losing hope in their fight for justice. Last April, they organised a massive tournament in Noisy-le-Sec open to all women. Twenty-five teams and 90 girls took part, in what Helene Ba described as an opportunity \u201cto show the FFBB that everything is fine and that we can play without any problems\u201d. Meanwhile, Diaba Konate \u2013 who recognises that she is one of the few Muslim girls in France who had the privilege to move to the US to pursue the sport she loves \u2013 is now coming back to her country to pave the way for cultural change in French basketball, and to be closer to family. She said that no woman should have to move away from home to play sports, and vowed to use her experiences to support others. \u201cThere\u2019s a battle to be fought in France. I want to help the FFBB to deconstruct stereotypes about veiled women as there\u2019s a lot of prejudice,\u201d Konate said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make that choice [between faith and sport]. We shouldn\u2019t be forced to do these things.\u201d \u201cRepresentation matters. It\u2019s important to have role models. You need people [who look] like you to be inspired. I have accomplished everything I wanted \u2013 now it\u2019s for the future generations.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Justin Salhani","title":"Does ceasefire in Gaza mean Israeli escalation with Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah?","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/13\/does-gaza-ceasefire-mean-israel-escalates-with-lebanons-hezbollah","description":"War drums beat louder as Israel kills Hezbollah commander and Lebanese group launches massive missile attack.","date":"2024-06-13T12:21:41Z","content":"War drums beat louder as Israel kills Hezbollah commander and Lebanese group launches massive missile attack. Beirut, Lebanon \u2013 Hezbollah fired more than 200 missiles and rockets across its southern border on Wednesday in one of its heaviest attacks on northern Israel since the 2006 war. The day before, Israel had assassinated Taleb Abdullah, the most senior Hezbollah commander killed since October 8. What happened on Tuesday and Wednesday is the latest intensification of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seem to be coming to a head. Israel has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, the day Hamas led an attack on Israel, killing 1,139 people and capturing some 240. Israel faces genocide charges for its actions in Gaza in a case brought to the International Criminal of Justice by South Africa. Analysts told Al Jazeera a Gaza ceasefire could shift Israel\u2019s military focus to Lebanon, where it has exchanged attacks with Hezbollah since the day after October 7. The exchanges across Lebanon\u2019s southern border are not exactly tit-for-tat. Al Jazeera found in an April investigation that Israel had launched more than five attacks on Lebanon for every attack from Hezbollah. Israel has killed about 300 Hezbollah members and more than 70 civilians during this time, while Israel says it has lost about 15 soldiers and 10 civilians.      While tensions are increasing along the border, analysts believe Israel would struggle to widen the war on Lebanon without first a ceasefire in Gaza. \u201cThe Israelis will not enlarge their fight with Lebanon as long as there is [still] one single shot in Gaza,\u201d Tannous Mouawad, a retired brigadier general in the Lebanese army, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhen [a ceasefire is achieved in] Gaza, the Israelis will definitely turn towards Lebanon.\u201d The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is under domestic pressure tas the school year approaches and more than 90,000 people remain displaced from their homes in northern Israel. Politicians say Hezbollah needs to be pushed back from the border before civilians can safely return \u2013 although many have reportedly decided not to come back. Netanyahu said last week that Israel is \u201cprepared for a very intense operation\u201d on the border with Lebanon. \u201cAn opinion poll published by [Israeli newspaper] Maariv \u2026 showed [that] over 70 percent of Israelis want to do away with Hezbollah,\u201d Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera. \u201cSeveral members of the [Israeli] war cabinet also share this hawkish position.\u201d \u201cWe are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made, and the [Israeli military] is prepared and very ready for this decision,\u201d chief of staff of Israel\u2019s army, Herzi Halevi, told military officials in early June.      A push for war against Hezbollah and Lebanon does not mean an assured victory for Israel. Bitar said any war would be \u201cextraordinarily counterproductive\u201d and could inflict heavy suffering on both the Lebanese and Israelis. \u201c[It will not be] a walk in the park [for Israel],\u201d he added. \u201cThe idea that they could occupy south Lebanon shows that they have learned nothing from Israeli history.\u201d Israel invaded south Lebanon in 1978 and 1982 during the country\u2019s civil war, aiming to push out Palestinian groups. Hezbollah itself, a Lebanese Shia group with close ties to Iran, was formed in 1982 in response to Israel\u2019s invasion. Israel also occupied south Lebanon from 1985 until 2000, after Hezbollah and other Lebanese forces pushed Israeli troops back across the border. An invasion would likely give Israel \u201cmuch more than it bargained for\u201d Bitar said. Today, Hezbollah is generally believed to be the world\u2019s strongest non-state actor, which means its military capabilities are significantly stronger than those of Hamas. Until now, it has largely struck military targets near the north of Israel but, analysts say, it striking military targets in areas like Tel Aviv, which is surrounded by civilian infrastructure, would be more problematic for Israel. \u201cThere\u2019s [already] a rift in Israel itself with northern settlers furious at the government,\u201d Amal Saad, author of the book Hizbu\u2019llah Politics and Religion, told Al Jazeera. Raining rockets down on a populated city could be a way \u201cto deepen preexisting divides and showcase what the rest of Israel can look like,\u201d she said. \u201cIsrael cannot tolerate a fraction of what Gaza or Lebanon can.\u201d In recent weeks, Hezbollah has also used new weapons not previously utilised on the battlefield, including anti-aircraft missiles, which it claimed forced Israeli fighter jets to retreat. This move was \u201csymbolic\u201d, according to Saad, because it \u201cchallenged Israeli\u2019s aerial supremacy\u201d. Hezbollah has also downed a number of Israeli drones in recent weeks. Of course, a wider war in Lebanon could come with serious consequences for both Israel and Lebanon. US officials have warned that an escalation against Hezbollah could draw in Iran and other allied forces in the region. And Lebanon, with its collapsed economy, would surely be left in an even worse state.\u00a0A war would bring \u201cextra large destruction by Israel on Lebanon\u201d, said Mouawad, the retired brigadier general. \u201cLebanon cannot afford its consequences.\u201d               Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Al Jazeera Staff","title":"Hezbollah launches rockets, drones at northern Israel military sites","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/13\/hezbollah-launches-rockets-drones-at-northern-israel-military-sites","description":"The Lebanese group fired 150 rockets and 30 suicide drones at 15 Israeli military positions, Hezbollah official says.","date":"2024-06-13T16:16:00Z","content":"The Lebanese group fired 150 rockets and 30 suicide drones at 15 Israeli military positions, Hezbollah official says. Hezbollah has said it launched a major drone and rocket attack targeting several Israeli military bases amid growing fears of an all-out war between the Lebanese armed group and Israel. It was the largest attack by the Iran-aligned group since the outbreak of violence between the two sides on October 8, a Hezbollah source told Al Jazeera Arabic on Thursday. The group said the attack in northern Israel was in retaliation for the assassination of senior commander Taleb Abdullah \u2013 known as Abu Taleb \u2013 in an Israeli air raid in the southern Lebanese village of Jouaiya earlier this week. The source said the \u201ccompound attack\u201d also aimed to establish deterrence after the killing of Abdullah. The Lebanese group used 150 rockets and 30 explosive drones to target 15 Israeli positions, including some in the occupied Golan Heights, the source said. Israeli media outlets reported that Hezbollah rockets wounded at least two people and started 15 fires. The Israeli military said in a post on X that \u201cnumerous\u201d launches were intercepted and that some ignited fires. In an official statement, Hezbollah said the operation was \u201cin support of the steadfast Palestinian people and their courageous and honourable resistance in Gaza and in the context of the response to the assassination that the Zionist enemy carries out in Jouaiyya\u201d. One of the Israeli units targeted in the attack is responsible for planning assassinations, Hezbollah said.      On Wednesday, Hezbollah had also fired a barrage of 200 rockets at Israel. There have been near-constant reports of rocket sirens being activated in northern Israel since Abdullah was killed along with three other fighters late on Tuesday. Hezbollah does not reveal details about its military structure or ranks, but Abdullah was only the second slain fighter from the group to be eulogised as a \u201ccommander\u201d in the past months \u2013 after Wissam al-Tawil, who was killed in an Israeli attack in January. Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad paid tribute to Abdullah on Wednesday, lauding his efforts to confront Israel. Hezbollah started attacking military bases in northern Israel after the outbreak of the war on Gaza in what it says is a \u201csupport front\u201d to back Palestinian armed groups. Israel has responded by bombing villages across south Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah\u2019s positions. Despite the near-daily exchange of fire, the confrontations have largely been limited to the border area. Tens of thousands of people in south Lebanon and northern Israel have fled their homes to escape the violence. Late last month, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah portrayed the Lebanese front with Israel as historically decisive. \u201cThis battle concerns Palestine, but also concerns the future of Lebanon and its water and oil resources,\u201d Nasrallah said. \u201cThis front is a support front that is part of the battle that will determine the fate of Palestine, Lebanon and the region strategically.\u201d Aided by Iran, the Lebanese organisation has grown in strength in recent years. Hezbollah fought a years-long war against Israel, culminating in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of south Lebanon they occupied for nearly two decades. In 2006, Israel launched a major offensive to disarm Hezbollah after the group carried out a deadly cross-border attack against Israeli forces. The conflict ended without major changes to the status quo. But Hezbollah has grown both its rocket arsenal and regional influence since then.      Earlier this month, Hezbollah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem told Al Jazeera that the group is \u201cready\u201d for war if Israel intensifies its attacks. \u201cAny Israeli expansion of the war on Lebanon will be met with devastation, destruction and displacement in Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Israel wants to fight an all-out war, we are ready for it.\u201d Israeli officials have pledged to push Hezbollah fighters further away from the country\u2019s borders, including by force if necessary. \u201cIsrael will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,\u201d Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said on Thursday. \u201cWhether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise, Israel will restore security on our northern border.\u201d A war with Hezbollah, which has demonstrated sophisticated military capabilities, including the use of guided rockets and precision drones, could prove more costly to Israel than the continuing conflict in Gaza. Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera\u2019s Zeina Khodr said Hezbollah has been stepping up its attacks not only to respond to the killing of its commander but also to strengthen Hamas\u2019s negotiating position amid ceasefire talks and warn Israel against launching a major offensive in Lebanon. \u201cSo this is also about deterrence on the part of Hezbollah,\u201d Khodr said. \u201cNo doubt, this is a dangerous escalation of this ongoing conflict,\u201d referring to the Israeli promise to respond to the latest attacks.

Greece has shut the site of the ancient Acropolis to tourists, closed schools and stationed medics across Athens as it faces the first heatwave of the summer. Temperatures were expected to hit 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on Wednesday and Thursday in parts of the Mediterranean country, driven by southerly winds bringing hot air and dust from North Africa. The Acropolis hill, which includes the Parthenon temple and is one of the world\u2019s most famous archaeological sites, was closed from noon to 5pm (09:00-14:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and Red Cross staff handed out bottles of water to tourists. Many primary schools and nurseries across the country have been told to close for two days. Greece is one of the European countries most affected by the climate crisis. Last year, rising temperatures fuelled deadly wildfires, and erratic rains caused some of the worst flooding on record, both of which damaged crops and livelihoods. Similar conditions were seen last year across much of southern Europe, including Portugal, France, Spain and Italy where fires led to dozens of deaths. In Greece, fires began earlier than expected this year, including one in March. Firefighters and police were patrolling forests from air and land on Wednesday, ahead of what is expected to be a windy end to the week, raising the risk of fires spreading. After last year\u2019s destructive wildfires, including on the island of Rhodes, which prompted the biggest evacuation in peacetime, Greece has scaled up its preparations by hiring more staff and stepping up training. Drones with thermal cameras were being used in Athens to coordinate the public health response, officials said. According to experts, heat is among the deadliest of natural hazards; more than 61,000 people died during Europe\u2019s record-breaking summer heatwave in 2022. A combination of human-caused climate change and the arrival of the natural climate phenomenon El Nino, which contributes to higher temperatures in many parts of the world, was a factor in pushing temperatures to record levels last summer in parts of Europe.  But as El Nino fades, scientists have said climate change, primarily triggered by greenhouse gas emissions mainly from burning fossil fuels, will result in more frequent, severe and dangerous heatwaves. \u201cClimate change across the globe is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves,\u201d Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading, told Al Jazeera in 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s effectively making heatwaves into severe heatwaves.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Al Jazeera","title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 839","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/13\/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-839","description":"As the war enters its 839th day, these are the main developments.","date":"2024-06-13T01:07:15Z","content":"As the war enters its 839th day, these are the main developments.

Russia\u2019s Admiral Gorshkov frigate and the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, accompanied by a tug boat and a fuel ship, have arrived in Cuba for a five-day visit seen as a show of force by Moscow amid rising tension over its invasion of Ukraine. Curious onlookers, fishermen and police gathered along the Malecon seafront boulevard in Havana to welcome the fleet as it entered the city\u2019s harbour on Wednesday. Cuba, a longtime ally of Russia, saluted the vessels\u2019 arrival with a 21-gun salute, while Russian diplomats waved small Russian flags and took selfies against a backdrop of the harbour\u2019s historic fortresses. The four Russian vessels conducted \u201chigh-precision missile weapons\u201d training in the Atlantic Ocean while on their way to Cuba. The submarine and frigate are equipped with Zircon hypersonic missiles, Kalibr cruise missiles and Onyx antiship missiles, the Russian Ministry of Defence said. The unusual deployment of the Russian navy so close to the United States comes after Washington and some of Ukraine\u2019s other Western allies allowed Kyiv to use their weapons on targets inside Russia amid a renewed Russian assault on northeastern Kharkiv and battle troop\u00a0and ammunition shortages. Havana lies just 160 kilometres (100 miles) from Key West in the southern state of Florida where the US has a naval air station. \u201cThe warships are a reminder to Washington that it is unpleasant when an adversary meddles in your near abroad,\u201d Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America programme at the Washington, DC-based Wilson Center think tank, told The Associated Press news agency, referring to Western involvement in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cIt also reminds Russia\u2019s friends in the region, including US antagonists Cuba and Venezuela, that Moscow is on their side,\u201d he said. Cuba said last week that the visit was standard practice by naval vessels from countries friendly to Havana and that the fleet was not carrying nuclear weapons. The US, which has been monitoring the vessels, has also played down the deployment. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday that such naval exercises were routine. \u201cWe have seen this kind of thing before, and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I\u2019m not going to read into it any particular motives,\u201d Sullivan said. He added that there was no evidence of Russia transferring any missiles to Cuba, but the US would remain vigilant. The port call coincided with a meeting in Moscow between Cuba\u2019s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. During the meeting, Rodriguez expressed his government\u2019s \u201crejection of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] towards the Russian border,\u201d which he said \u201cled to the current conflict in Europe, and especially between Moscow and Kyiv\u201d, according to a Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement. He also called for \u201ca diplomatic, constructive and realistic solution\u201d to the conflict. During the Cold War, Cuba was an important ally of the then Soviet Union, and when Moscow responded to a US missile deployment in Turkey by sending ballistic missiles to Cuba, the standoff brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba has maintained relations with Russia and the two countries have become closer since a 2022 meeting between Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Havana, the relationship is driven mainly by economic necessity as it grapples with shortages of everything from food and medicine to fuel. The US has maintained an economic and trade embargo on Cuba since 1960. \u201cThis is not October 1962 again,\u201d Javier Farje, an expert on Latin American politics, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis is a different time. Cuba has become increasingly dependent on Russia because of the lack of economic development.\u201d Russia in March delivered 90,000 metric tonnes of Russian oil to Cuba to help alleviate shortages and has promised to help Havana in projects ranging from sugar production to infrastructure, renewable energy and tourism. The Russian ships are expected to remain in Havana until June 17. US officials expect the Russian ships to remain in the region throughout the summer and possibly also stop in Venezuela.

At least 117.3 million people, or one in 69 individuals worldwide, remain forcibly displaced, according to a report released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today. Forced displacement as a result of conflict and violence, persecution and human rights violations, has continued to rise in the first four months of 2024 and is likely to have surpassed 120 million by the end of April 2024. Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees said, \u201cBehind these stark and rising numbers lie countless human tragedies. That suffering must galvanise the international community to act urgently to tackle the root causes of forced displacement.\u201d  Of the 117.3 million forcibly displaced, 68.3 million are internally displaced within their own countries due to conflict or other crises, such as Gaza where the UN estimates about 75 percent of the population, or more than 1.7 million people have been displaced by Israel\u2019s continuing assault. The number of refugees who crossed international borders, in 2023 rose by seven percent to 43.4 million. The increase is driven by displacement in Sudan and ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and other regions. The number of asylum seekers \u2013 people seeking protection in another country due to persecution or fear of harm in their home country \u2013 waiting for a decision stood at 6.9 million, an increase of 26 percent from the previous year.  In 1951, the UN established the Refugee Convention to protect the rights of refugees in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. In 1967, the convention was expanded to address displacement across the rest of the world. When the Refugee Convention was born, there were 2.1 million refugees. By 1980, the number of refugees recorded by the UN surpassed 10 million for the first time. Wars in Afghanistan and Ethiopia during the 1980s caused the number of refugees to double to 20 million by 1990.  The number of refugees remained fairly consistent over the next two decades. However, the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, together with the civil wars in South Sudan and Syria, resulted in refugee numbers exceeding 30 million by the end of 2021. The war in Ukraine, which started in 2022, led to one of the fastest growing refugee crises since World War II with 5.7 million people forced to flee Ukraine in less than a year.\u00a0 By the end of 2023, six million Ukrainians remained forcibly displaced. In 2023, conflict in Sudan between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces increased the number of refugees to 1.5 million. Before the war, Sudan hosted many Syrian refugees. When the war started, the number of Syrian refugees in Sudan dropped from 93,500 in 2022 to 26,600 in 2023, as many left for other countries. Thousands of people are still being displaced daily, more than a year after the conflict began. Most recently, Israel\u2019s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has had a devastating toll on the Palestinian population. The UNRWA estimates that between October and December 2023, up to 1.7 million people \u2013 more than 75 percent of the population- have been displaced within the Gaza Strip, with many having been forced to flee multiple times. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is extremely dire, with all 2.3 million inhabitants facing food insecurity and the threat of famine. Almost three-quarters (72 percent) of all refugees came from just five countries: Afghanistan (6.4 million), Syria (6.4 million),\u00a0Venezuela (6.1 million), Ukraine (6 million) and Palestine (6 million). Under international law, refugees are people who are forced to flee their home countries to escape persecution or a serious threat to their life, physical integrity or freedom.  Almost 70 percent of refugees and others in need of international protection lived in countries neighbouring their countries of origin. Globally, the largest refugee populations are hosted by Iran (3.8 million), Turkey (3.3 million), Colombia (2.9 million), Germany (2.6 million) and Pakistan (2 million). Nearly all refugees in Iran and Pakistan are Afghans, while most refugees in Turkey are Syrians. In the last decade, refugee numbers have increased in these major host countries, except for Turkey, where numbers have dropped by 14 percent since 2021. Germany is the only major host country that does not border the main refugee source countries. Most refugees in Germany at the end of the year were from Ukraine (1.1 million), Syria (705,800), Afghanistan (255,100), and Iraq (146,500).

Will rain play spoilsport? Al Jazeera breaks it down. It is that time again for cricket fans, when they find themselves applying their mathematical and prediction skills to work out whether their favourite team will qualify for the next round of a world cup. After 12 days and at least two rounds of group matches at the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, one team from each of the four groups has qualified for the Super Eight stage, four teams are already out of the race and the rest of the 12 teams will fight it out for the four remaining spots. Some of these 12 sides stand half a step away from crossing over to the next stage of the tournament, while others have their fates hanging by a thread, a favourable weather forecast and their net run rates. Al Jazeera breaks down the various scenarios for all four groups and the 20 teams at the end of the round of matches on June 12. All the teams in the tournament-opening group have now played three matches each. The group moves to Florida for its last run of matches, but plenty of rain is forecast in the Sunshine State, which could dampen the chances of some of the teams. Matches: 3\n Points:\u00a06\nNRR: 1.137\nRemaining fixture: Canada (June 15)\nThe 2007 champions have won all three games and have made it through. Matches: 3\nPoints: 4\nNRR: 0.127\nRemaining fixture: Ireland (June 14)\nThe co-hosts set the tournament on fire with their thrilling win over Pakistan, which was preceded by the opening game win over neighbours Canada. Despite a hard-fought loss against India, all they need now is a win over a struggling Ireland to keep the American dream alive. A washout in their last game, as well as Pakistan\u2019s, will also see them go through on superior NRR. Matches: 3\nPoints: 2\nNRR: 0.191\nRemaining fixture: Ireland (June 16)\nIt is an all-too-familiar territory for Pakistan fans. Once again, they find themselves hoping that the right team in green turns up on the day of the match and then praying for the other results and the weather to favour them. Babar Azam\u2019s side had a typically horrible start to the tournament, losing to debutants USA in a super over finish and then losing, from a winning position, against India. Now, they need to beat Ireland by a big margin and hope that the USA have a major slip-up in their last game. All of which is subject to the weather in Florida. Matches: 3\nPoints: 2\nNRR: -0.493\nRemaining fixture: India (June 15)\nThe other North American side in this World Cup have not quite matched their neighbours, but have still managed to bag one win over ICC full-member team Ireland. Should they manage to beat powerhouse India by a big margin, Canada would need Pakistan and the USA to lose their last respective games heavily. Matches: 2\nPoints: 0\nNRR: -1.1712\nRemaining fixture: Pakistan (June 16)\nThe Irish have had a disappointing tournament and their hopes of advancing are all but quashed. With rain forecast across their last two games, only a miraculous turnaround and the luck of the Irish can keep them alive in the tournament. The group with the two limited-overs champions has seen one side seal a spot and the other nearly seal a flight back home. Matches: 3\nPoints: 6\nNRR: 3.58\nRemaining fixture: Scotland (June 15)\nThe 50-over world champions have sailed through to the next round with three comprehensive wins. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 5\nNRR: 2.164\nRemaining fixture: Australia (June 15)\nThe Scots could have won their opening fixture against England, but managed to get one point from it after a washout. Big wins over Namibia and Oman have kept them comfortably placed in the second spot. All they need to do is avoid a heavy defeat against Australia. Matches: 2\nPoints: 1\nNRR: -1.8\nRemaining fixture: Oman (June 13), Namibia (June 15)\nThe holders bagged a point in their opening game against Scotland after a washout and then were blown away by Australia. Anything less than two massive wins will throw the defending champions out of the tournament. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 2\nNRR: -2.098\nRemaining fixture: England (June 15)\nThe African nation managed to beat Oman for their first win of the tournament and while they will back themselves against a desperate England side, they will still not be able to qualify as four points at the end of their group will still leave them behind Scotland. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 0\nNRR: -1.613\nRemaining fixture: England (June 13)\nOman\u2019s disappointing tournament will come to an end on June 13, regardless of the result of their last match. Co-hosts West Indies were always going to be favourites for the Super Eights and they are now through to the next round, while Afghanistan are favourites to follow them. New Zealand\u2019s disappointing run is likely to see them go out. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 6\nNRR: 2.596\nRemaining fixture: Afghanistan (June 17)\nThe two-time champions and co-hosts have qualified after three straight wins. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 4\nNRR: 5.225\nRemaining fixtures: PNG (June 13), West Indies (June 17)\nAfghanistan have shown strength in their bowling and batting to be counted as one of the outside favourites for the crown and are nearly through with four points and a healthy NRR. All they need is a point from their last two matches. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 2\nNRR: -4.217\nRemaining fixture: New Zealand (June 14)\nThe Cricket Cranes have carried their African fairy tale to the T20 World Cup. Their fans danced with joy as they beat PNG for their first win, but the men in yellow need a massive win over New Zealand and a slip-up from Afghanistan to have a mathematical chance of qualifying. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 0\nNRR: -0.434\nRemaining fixture: Afghanistan (June 13), New Zealand (June 17)\nThe Pacific islanders have had a disappointing tournament. And while their NRR is better than two other teams in the group, they must beat a strong Afghanistan side and former finalists New Zealand by healthy margins, and then need Afghanistan to lose their other match by a big margin. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 0\nNRR: -2.425\nRemaining fixture: Uganda (June 14), PNG (June 17)\nThe 2021 finalists have looked out of sorts in the tournament. And while their remaining matches are against much weaker sides, New Zealand need Afghanistan to slip up dramatically to have a shot at the Super Eights. The so-called group of death has not entirely lived up to its billing as one team has progressed unscathed and two of the other four are left to fight it out among themselves. Points: 6\nNRR: 0.603\nRemaining fixture: Nepal (June 14)\nDespite early stutters in their three games in New York, the Proteas have managed to pass the test of the tricky pitch and have gone through. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 2\nNRR: 0.075\nRemaining fixture: Netherlands (June 13), Nepal (June 16)\nBangladesh\u2019s pretournament form did not make them favourites to qualify from this group, but should they beat their next two opponents, the Bengal Tigers will find themselves in the Super Eights. One win, one loss, and a win for the Netherlands will bring the equation down to NRR. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 2\nNRR: 0.024\nRemaining fixtures: Bangladesh (June 13), Sri Lanka (June 16)\nThe Dutch have beaten the lowest-ranked team in the group, Nepal, but those two points could be crucial in deciding their fate. A win over Bangladesh will not be enough to qualify but it can give them an edge going into the last round of matches. Matches played: 2\nPoints: 1\nNRR: -0.0539\nRemaining fixtures: South Africa (June 14), Bangladesh (June 16)\nIf Super Eight qualification was handed out on the basis of passion and spirit, Nepal would have been among the first teams to qualify. The Rhinos and their fans have brought abundant joy and smiles to the tournament, but face two tough opponents in their last two games. However, two improbable wins could still see them through. Matches played: 3\nPoints: 1\nNRR: -0.777\nRemaining fixture: Netherlands (June 16)\nSri Lanka\u2019s disappointing show at world cups continues and the 2014 champions find themselves out of contention yet again.

Washington, DC \u2013\u00a0It has been two weeks since Donald Trump became the first former United States president convicted of criminal charges. But polls show the extraordinary verdict has largely been met with a resounding ho-hum. On May 30, Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in what prosecutors described as an effort to conceal a hush-money payment to a porn star. But experts say the public response to the verdict has been a ripple rather than a tidal wave \u2014 and that is a reflection of the unique political moment the US finds itself in. Trump is seeking re-election in November, and he is in a tight race against current President Joe Biden. But his campaign has been bolstered by strong support among Republicans, who have largely rallied under his leadership. Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University, credited the muted reaction following May\u2019s historic verdict to the Republican Party \u2014 and the media \u2014 normalising what should be remarkable. \u201cWe never, in the 230 years plus of American history, have had a former president, or even a major party presidential candidate, charged with a crime, much less convicted of multiple felonies,\u201d Lichtman told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis is a cataclysmic event without precedent, and at least so far, it doesn\u2019t seem to have much of an impact on people\u2019s views of Donald Trump.\u201d According to Lichtman, the subdued response has been, in many ways, a culmination of Trump\u2019s years-long effort to build a perception of both political impunity and persecution. Trump bragged in 2016 that he could shoot someone on New York City\u2019s Fifth Avenue and still \u201cnot lose any voters\u201d. He ultimately won that year\u2019s presidential race. Nevertheless, for years, he has also promoted \u2014 without evidence \u2014 the claim that he is the target of a coordinated political \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, designed to keep him from power.      Lichtman added that the media\u2019s coverage of the trial also contributed to the beige public reaction. The trial, which took place in New York City, hinged on the prosecution\u2019s argument that Trump covered up the hush-money payment to protect his chances in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the charges. But prosecutors maintained he used illegal means to conceal information from the American electorate. The fact that the media referred to the trial as the \u201chush-money\u201d case contributed to the lack of outrage, Lichtman said. He believes the verdict would have resounded more if the media had framed the case as a question of \u201cfraud perpetrated on the American people\u201d. \u201cTrump has played the media like a fiddle,\u201d Lichtman explained. \u201cThen, let\u2019s not forget, virtually to a person, the entire Republican Party has bought into his lies that he was convicted by a rigged system in a phoney trial.\u201d That was a message Trump and his campaign helped calcify as the New York verdict approached. In a news conference after being found guilty, the former president sought to directly tie his conviction to the Biden administration, without providing evidence for the claim. \u201cThis is all done by Biden and his people,\u201d Trump said in the news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a corrupt government. We have a corrupt country.\u201d Shortly after, he again raised the spectre of political violence if he were to be imprisoned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cYou know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d Earlier this week, his campaign even sent out an email titled, \u201cHaul out the Guillotine\u201d, a reference to the French Revolution. For his part, Biden \u2013 through campaign communications and the White House \u2013 has portrayed the conviction of proof of a healthy and impartial justice system. The New York trial is far from the end of Trump\u2019s legal woes. He faces separate state and federal charges related to efforts to subvert his 2020 election loss to Biden, as well as a fourth indictment in Florida for allegedly hoarding classified documents. But none of the other cases are expected to conclude before the presidential race on November 5. That means the New York trial offers the first \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 litmus test for how a criminal conviction will be viewed by the nearly 160 million registered voters in the US. Since the verdict, there has been evidence that Trump\u2019s strategy has helped to energise his supporters. His campaign claimed to have raised $141m in May, including two million small-money donations. More than a third of those donations were made online in the 24 hours after the verdict, according to Trump\u2019s campaign, although the official fundraising filings for the period have not yet been released. Then, there have been a series of polls that have shown a broadly ambivalent response to the prospect of electing a convicted felon as president. A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted immediately after the verdict found that only 10 percent of registered Republicans reported they were less likely to vote for Trump after the conviction. Meanwhile, 56 percent of Republicans said the case would have no effect on their vote. Another 35 percent indicated it would make them more likely to vote for Trump.      The verdict\u2019s impact was more pronounced among independent voters, a coveted demographic in US politics. Approximately 25 percent of the independent voters surveyed said Trump\u2019s conviction made them less likely to support him in November, compared with 18 percent who said they were more likely to vote for him. However, the majority of the group \u2014 56 percent \u2014 said the conviction would have no impact on their decision. Still, two weeks after the verdict, most major polls and forecasters show Biden and Trump neck and neck in the presidential race, although several leading organisations \u2014 including FiveThirtyEight and Morning Consult \u2014 put Biden ahead with a slight edge. This week, CBS News and YouGov released another poll showing the candidates virtually tied in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. However, as before, the majority of the voters surveyed said the New York conviction was not a factor in how they would cast their ballot come November. Michael Fauntroy, the founding director of the Race, Politics and Policy Center at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera the cascade of post-verdict polls demonstrates one thing: \u201cTrump has been hurt, but not mortally so.\u201d But the November 5 election is still more than four months away. That could help or hurt Trump. Experts note that the public\u2019s attention span is short \u2014 and already, other high-profile news items have diverted focus away from the New York verdict. They include the conviction of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, on charges he lied on a federal firearm background check form. The verdict represents the first time a sitting president\u2019s child has been found guilty of criminal charges. The Trump campaign sought to play up the conviction as evidence of what it calls the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d. But the verdict could also prove a double-edged sword, with some observers noting the case may neutralise Trump\u2019s claim that the judiciary is corrupted by political bias. After all, the Hunter Biden case was prosecuted by the Department of Justice, which falls under Biden\u2019s White House. And the president has ruled out pardoning his son. Then there is Trump\u2019s upcoming sentencing hearing on July 11. The severity of the penalty is expected to impact voter opinion. Fauntroy cautioned that the eventual sentence may make Trump\u2019s conviction stickier and more difficult for his campaign to navigate. \u201cThe sentencing may well accelerate the concern that Republicans have,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if he gets jail time? What if he gets house arrest? What if he gets 30 days house arrest? What if he gets 1,000 hours of community service?\u201d Trump\u2019s sentence, Fauntroy explained, \u201ccould be potentially very problematic for him\u201d.      Even slight fluctuations in the polls could also spell trouble for Trump. Any dip in support could\u00a0make the difference in an election that is expected to turn on a knife\u2019s edge. \u201cIt could have a small, immediate impact but a large ultimate impact,\u201d Fauntroy said, \u201cif the number of Republicans who are repulsed by this remains as it is now.\u201d And there is perhaps a larger reason for the disquiet looming over Trump\u2019s camp, he added. Several polls, including those conducted by Morning Consult and ABC News\/Ipsos, have found a majority of Americans think the guilty verdict was correct. Fauntroy explained that shows a persistent vulnerability that could later be activated by Trump\u2019s opponents. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a slight negative for Trump,\u201d Fauntroy said, \u201cbut potentially a really bad one going forward.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Al Jazeera","title":"Why are Russian warships in Cuba?","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/13\/why-are-russian-warships-in-cuba","description":"Russian warships sailed into Cuba\u2019s main harbour in what appears to be a show of strength by Moscow.","date":"2024-06-13T13:38:42Z","content":"Russian warships sailed into Cuba\u2019s main harbour in what appears to be a show of strength by Moscow amid heightened tensions with the US. On Wednesday, dozens of Havana residents gathered and watched as Russian warships sailed into Cuba\u2019s main harbour \u2013 in the latest display of naval strength by Moscow amid heightened tensions with the United States. The Caribbean nation is a neighbour of the US, which at its closest point, is just about 150 kilometres (94 miles) away, but have had tense relations for decades. While it is not the first time Russian navy ships have visited Cuba, this convoy appears to be the largest in several years. The fleet is expected to stay between June 12 and 17 and the public will be allowed to take tours of the vessels. Here\u2019s what we know about why Russia has sent ships to Cuba now, how far back Russian-Cuban ties go, and why the two have gotten closer in the past year: The flotilla is part of a \u201cfriendly\u201d routine visit between the two countries\u2019 navies, Cuban officials have said. The crew on board are expected to conduct military training exercises during their time in the Caribbean. But analysts have said Moscow\u2019s move is largely calculated to flex naval muscle in the US\u2019s back yard. The detachment comes after escalating tensions between Russia and the US, following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision in May to allow Ukraine to attack Russian targets with American weapons. Russian President Putin has promised retaliation against not only the US, but also other Western allies of Ukraine who also removed restrictions on using their weapons against Moscow. \u201cThat would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way,\u201d Putin said last week, adding that Moscow was ready to use nuclear weapons. Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America programme at the Washington, DC-based Wilson Center think tank, told The Associated Press news agency that \u201cthe warships are a reminder to Washington that it is unpleasant when an adversary meddles in your [neighbourhood].\u201d The naval show-off is also meant to reassure Moscow\u2019s Latin American allies \u2013 Cuba and Venezuela, of its continued support for them against Washington, some experts said. Like Russia and Cuba, economically ravaged Venezuela has unpleasant relations with the US and is under American sanctions. The Russian fleet includes four vehicles in total. \u00a0 US officials are publicly downplaying the deployment, and say it is part of usual port-calls between Russia and Cuba. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday that such naval exercises were routine and that there were no signs Moscow was transferring missiles to Havana. Last July, Perekop \u2013 a Russian training ship equipped with anti-aircraft guns and a rocket launcher \u2013 was on a four-day visit to Havana and conducted \u201ca range of activities\u201d according to Cuban officials. The Admiral itself visited in 2019. \u201cWe have seen this kind of thing before, and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I\u2019m not going to read into it any particular motives,\u201d Sullivan said, adding that the US would remain vigilant. The US deployed ships and planes that monitored the movement of the fleet even before it arrived in Cuba and assessed there were no nuclear weapons on board, officials speaking to US media said, noting that the fleet stayed in international waters throughout. Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that the fleet had conducted drills in the Atlantic while on the way to Cuba. The Russian crew practised using high-precision missile weapons with the aid of computer-simulated enemy ship targets located at a distance of more than 600km (more than 320 nautical miles), according to the ministry. Meanwhile, the Cuban Foreign Ministry, before the fleet\u2019s arrival, stressed that none of the warships would carry nuclear weapons and added that their presence \u201cdoes not represent a threat to the region\u201d. \u201cVisits by naval units from other countries are a historical practice of the revolutionary government with nations that maintain relations of friendship and collaboration,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Both Russia and Cuba have long been united in their opposition to the US. During the Cold War, their ties deepened intensely, as the then-Soviet Union befriended the ideologically aligned Havana. Moscow provided financial aid, military equipment, and naval training, boosting the country\u2019s military might in the Caribbean. Things came to a head in 1962 when Moscow transferred nuclear weapons to Cuba, prompting a response from the US, which imposed a naval blockade on Havana in response. That tense episode is now known as the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The fall of the Soviet Union saw Cuba lose a major economic partner and fall into economic depression. But in recent years, the countries\u2019 cooperation has again deepened. Analysts have said this week\u2019s naval show-off marked that intensifying relationship, but noted that it does not necessarily mean a rehash of events in 1962. Rather, Cuba, in particular, is again drawn to Russia for economic reasons, rather than ideology. In the longest-lasting trade sanctions in modern history, the US has since 1958 banned American entities from trading with Cuba \u2013 following Fidel Castro\u2019s overthrow of a US-backed government in Havana. Although the sanctions have been eased at different times, they have largely remained over the years. In 2015, US President Barack Obama decided to restore diplomatic ties with Cuba after 50 years, but his successor Donald Trump reversed course nearly four years later. That has partly contributed to a continuing economic crisis in the Caribbean country \u2013 alongside shaky government economic policies \u2013 analysts said. \u201cThe blockade qualifies as a crime of genocide,\u201d Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno\u00a0Rodriguez Parrilla said at a UN General Assembly meeting in November, referring to the US sanctions. Deteriorating public services, regular power cuts, food and fuel shortages, and high inflation have pushed Cuba into its worst economic crisis in decades. In recent years, Cuba has again turned to Russia, aiming to draw foreign investors. The two countries, last May, kicked off a series of economic partnerships, including one that will allow Russian businesses to lease Cuban land for 30 years \u2013 an unusual move in the largely closed-off country. Bilateral trade between Cuba and Russia reached $450m in 2022, three times that of 2021, Russian officials said. About 90 percent of the trade comprised sales of petroleum products and soy oil, as Russia pumps in badly needed fuel to the country. Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba\u2019s former minister of foreign commerce, told reporters on the sidelines of a business forum hosting Russian investors in Havana last May that the economic ties between Russia and Cuba would only grow stronger. \u201cNothing and no one can stop it,\u201d Cabrisas said.

Malaysia has been handed back $156m in assets linked to the 1MDB scandal after an investigation by the United States, the US embassy in Kuala Lumpur has said. US ambassador to Malaysia Edgard D Kagan said the funds were the fourth tranche of assets to be returned to the country following a probe by the US Department of Justice. \u201cThis extraordinary sum of money is going back to the people of Malaysia where it belongs and where it can finally be used for its original intended purpose \u2013 to better the lives of everyday Malaysians,\u201d Kagan said in a statement released by the embassy late on Thursday. Kagan met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday to confirm the latest tranche, which brings the total amount of returned funds to $1.4bn, the embassy said. US officials estimate that more than $4.5bn was misappropriated from Malaysia\u2019s state fund 1MDB by high-level officials and their associates. The resulting scandal ushered in the first change in Malaysia\u2019s government in six decades, spawned investigations in six countries, and led to the convictions of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng. Malaysia earlier this year announced that it had recovered property and other assets worth 23.9m ringgit ($5m) from 1MDB, which was established by Najib to spur economic development. Malaysia\u2019s pardons board in February halved Najib\u2019s 12-year prison sentence and reduced a fine imposed against him from 210 million ringgit ($44.5m) to 50 million ringgit ($10.6m). Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who is the suspected mastermind of the scheme, was indicted in 2018 but remains at large. Malaysian officials have said Low is in China, which Beijing has denied.

The status of Porzingis for the rest of the series appears in doubt, but it might not matter. None of the previous 156 teams to face a 3-0 deficit have rallied to win an NBA playoff series. The Mavs almost pulled off a crazy comeback to avoid the big hole. Boston led 91-70 at the end of a 20-5 run early in the fourth quarter before Dallas answered with a 22-2 spurt to get within a point with 3:30 remaining. The problem was, Luka Doncic picked up his sixth foul with 4:12 remaining when a challenge was unsuccessful before Kyrie Irving, who scored 35 points, hit a jumper to get Dallas within one. Tatum and Brown saved the Celtics from there, with some help from Derrick White, who scored 16. Those three combined for the remaining 13 Boston points to get the Celtics within a victory of their first title since 2008, and just the second since 1986. The Celtics have led 3-0 in the NBA Finals only once, finishing off the Lakers in a sweep in 1959.

That included when Doncic was called for a blocking foul on a driving Brown. The Mavs had nothing to lose with the challenge since it meant trying to save their superstar from disqualification. Without Doncic, PJ Washington Jr, Irving and Tim Hardaway Jr each missed a 3-pointer in the final minute as Irving\u2019s personal losing streak against his former team reached 13 games. \u201cWe had a good chance,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe were close. Just didn\u2019t get it. I wish I was out there.\u201d An energised Dallas crowd was ready for its first finals game in 13 years, with Super Bowl-winning quarterback and Mavs fan Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs frequently getting out of his seat near midcourt. The Mavs used the needed boost coming off two losses in Boston, taking their biggest lead of the series while running out to a 22-9 lead. Doncic and Irving drove for buckets while also hitting a 3 apiece. The Celtics answered with a 21-9 finish to the first quarter. Sam Hauser hit two of his first-half 3s \u2013 on three attempts \u2013 to help wrap up a run that started with four points from Brown and a 3 from Tatum. Defence dominated the start of the second quarter, Boston holding a 5-2 edge nearly six minutes in before Irving and Tatum traded 3s to start a scoring burst. \u201cThey came out swinging,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cThat was to be expected. They were at home, the crowd was behind them. We expected their first punch.\u201d Once they withstood it, it appeared the Celtics would coast after outscoring the Mavs 35-19 in the third quarter, before the Mavs\u2019 late rally. After it was over, pockets of Celtics fans screamed with delight in a mostly empty arena, seemingly starting the celebration of the inevitable championship win.

Who: Bangladesh vs Netherlands\nWhat: ICC T20 World Cup Group D match\nWhen: Thursday, June 13, 10:30am local time (14:30 GMT)\nWhere: Arnos Vale Stadium, Kingstown, Saint Vincent\nHow to follow: Al Jazeera will have live coverage from 11:30 GMT. When Bangladesh and Netherlands meet for their third group match of the T20 World Cup, the winners will walk away with a greater likelihood of qualifying for the Super Eight stage of the tournament. Group D action now moves to the Caribbean, with the match on Thursday being held at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown, Saint Vincent. Both teams have two points each from their two games and are sandwiched between leaders South Africa \u2013 who have qualified for the Super Eights \u2013 and bottom two sides Nepal and Sri Lanka, both of whom are unlikely to go through. It leaves these two sides to battle it out for the second qualifying spot, and Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto believes the side that tackles the conditions better will come out on top. \u201cIt is very difficult to say how many runs will be scored on this wicket, so it is very important to read the wicket quickly,\u201d Shanto told reporters on Wednesday. He expects Bangladeshi fans to continue supporting them in the West Indies, as they have done in the US leg of their matches. \u201cWherever we play, [our] supporters will come, especially in the West Indies. It feels good.\u201d Bangladesh fans will hope their team\u2019s qualification for Super Eights does not come down to prayers. One fan asked the men in green to do their bit while the fans do theirs, with a placard reading: \u201cYou play, we pray\u201d during their match against South Africa. The Netherlands are also aware of the importance of the clash and their bowler Logan van Beek said the team have had \u201cvery nice\u201d preparations ahead of it. \u201cThis is the biggest match that we are probably going to play for this tournament,\u201d van Beek said. He said he expects the wicket to be flat, with no dents but the ground still has plenty of \u201cunknowns\u201d for both sides. The men in orange are confident of bagging an important win over their group rivals. \u201cThe confidence that we\u2019ve got over the last few years of beating big teams at big competitions and in do-or-die matches, we\u2019ve stood up at right times and that\u2019s how the Dutch play. We kind of find ourselves in these do-or-die matches all year round and so we\u2019re used to that pressure and excited to do it again.\u201d The Arnos Vale Stadium has plenty of unknowns surrounding it as it has not hosted an international cricket match in 10 years. In the past, the pitch has produced an even contest between bat and ball, with spinners finding plenty of success. While there is no rain forecast, weather conditions will be typically hot and humid. The two sides have met four times in the T20 format. Bangladesh have won three of those matches, including the most recent one at the T20 World Cup 2022. The only T20 win for the Netherlands against Bangladesh came in 2012. Both sides have won one each and lost one game \u2013 against South Africa \u2013 in the tournament so far. Bangladesh have relied on their power-hitting batters and calm lower-order veteran Mahmudullah to see them through with the bat. Rishad Hossain has also played an invaluable role with the ball. The Netherlands have been tidy with the ball and excellent on the field. All they need is for their batting to step up a gear.

Some 120 million people were displaced globally due to wars and conflicts, the UNHCR\u2019s flagship Global Trends Report published on Thursday said. The figure would make the global displaced population equivalent to the 12th largest country in the world, about the size of Japan. \u201cOne hundred and twenty million is a pretty high figure and also very significant,\u201d said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. \u201cMost regrettably, it is the 12th consecutive year in which this figure goes up. Behind these stark and rising numbers lie countless human tragedies. That suffering must galvanise the international community to act urgently to tackle the root causes of forced displacement,\u201d\u00a0added Grandi. Recent situations in Sudan, Gaza, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Myanmar are also creating new displacements. At the end of 2023, 10.8 million Sudanese remained uprooted, while UNRWA estimates at that time said 1.7 million people had been displaced in the Gaza Strip due to Israeli attacks \u2013 75 percent of the Strip\u2019s population. Syria remains the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis, with 13.8 million forcibly displaced in and outside the country. The largest increase in displacement came from people fleeing conflicts in their own countries, rising to 68.3 million people \u2013 up almost 50 percent over five years. The number of refugees in need of international protection climbed to 43.4 million, the vast majority of them being hosted in countries neighbouring their own, with 75 percent residing in low and middle-income countries that together produce less than 20 percent of the world\u2019s income. The UNHCR warned that without better cooperation and concerted efforts to address the conflicts, human rights violations and the climate crisis, displacement figures will keep rising, bringing more misery and costly humanitarian responses.

Elon Musk has won back his $44.9bn pay package at electric carmaker Tesla after shareholders voted to restore the compensation deal in a ringing endorsement of his leadership. The vote at Tesla\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday came after a judge in the US state of Delaware threw out the deal after finding that the company\u2019s board was too close to Musk and had not protected shareholders\u2019 interests. \u201cI just want to start off by saying, hot damn, I love you guys!\u201d a jubilant Musk said as he appeared on stage after the vote. \u201cWe have the most awesome shareholder base. I mean it\u2019s just incredible.\u201d Musk\u2019s pay deal was valued at about $56bn at the peak of Tesla\u2019s share price in late 2021 but has since declined in value by about one-quarter in tandem with a drop in the company\u2019s stock price. The shareholders\u2019 vote does not necessarily mean Musk will receive the pay package but could bolster Tesla\u2019s appeal against the Delaware ruling against the deal. In her January decision, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick described the pay package as \u201cunfathomable\u201d. \u201cSwept up by the rhetoric of \u2018all upside,\u2019 or perhaps starry eyed by Musk\u2019s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\u201d McCormick wrote in her decision. Musk, who founded Tesla in 2003, does not receive a salary for leading the carmaker. Under the terms of his 2018 pay deal, Musk agreed to be paid stock worth about 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s equity each time the company achieved one of its operational and financial goals. While Tesla\u2019s business has soared under Musk\u2019s leadership, at one point taking the company\u2019s market value to $1.24 trillion, sales have slowed sharply amid growing competition from Chinese EV makers. Musk has also attracted controversy with his outspoken views on politics and battled perceptions that he is spread too thin due to his involvement in six companies, including rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X. Tesla shares rose 0.7 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, after earlier gaining 2.9 percent following Musk\u2019s announcement on social media that investors backed the deal. Prior to Thursday\u2019s vote, Musk had expressed doubts about his future at Tesla. In January, Musk said in a post on X that he would prefer to build artificial intelligence and robotics products outside of Tesla if he could not have a 25 percent stake in the company. Musk is already by far Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, holding more than 20 percent of its equity. Tesla shareholders on Thursday also approved proposals to move the company\u2019s incorporation from Delaware to Texas and reappoint Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch \u2013 Musk\u2019s brother and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son, respectively \u2013 to the company\u2019s board. Tesla did not announce the vote tallies, but several large institutional investors had opposed the deal, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund.

Manager Jurgen Klinsmann was at the helm for Die Mannschaft \u2013 which directly translates as \u201cThe Team\u201d \u2013 at the World Cup 18 years ago. Julian Nagelsmann is in the hot seat for the Euro 2024. In 2006, a youthful German side captured the nation\u2019s imagination, staging an unlikely run to the semifinals. In 2024, a similar campaign is hoped for \u2013 but not necessarily expected. It\u2019s been a harrowing few years for the three-time winner of the European football championship, who, since Euro 2016, have not won a knockout game at a major tournament. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was their second successive group stage exit, and following their 4-1 loss to Japan last September, Hansi Flick became the first Germany boss to be fired from the role. Germany has won just five of their 13 games since Qatar. But it is the last two \u2013 which came in the March international window \u2013 that have seen optimism spread throughout the country before Euro 2024. The first rule of international football is: Do not put any weight on friendlies. Given how bereft of joy German fans have been in recent years, it is understandable why they were swept up by the wins over France (2-0) and Netherlands (2-1). But it was not completely without reason. After some tinkering in his first four games, Nagelsmann settled on a 4-2-3-1 formation for the two friendlies and just like that, it all clicked. The trio of Jamal Musiala, Ilkay Gundogan and Florian Wirtz with Kai Havertz in midfield infused the attack with dynamism. Jonathan Tah and Antonio Rudiger brought solidity to the backline. Wing-back was where Nagelsmann had experimented the most \u2013 Havertz, Niklas Sule, Robin Gosens, Benjamin Henrichs and Tah were all fielded in the position before March. But in Joshua Kimmich and Stuttgart\u2019s Maximilian Mittelstaedt, Nagelsmann appears to have found his preferred duo to flank the centrebacks. Mittelstaedt made his debut in the win against France and three days later, scored his first international goal against Netherlands. Central to the whole system, of course, is superstar Toni Kroos. The Real Madrid midfielder has been coaxed out of retirement and seven seconds into his return, set up Wirtz\u2019s opener against France with one of his archetypal clipped passes. In addition to the balance Kroos brings to the side, his presence frees up Gundogan to operate off the top of the attack. It is a role similar to the one he thrived in at Manchester City, where he was shielded by Rodri. Nagelsmann had signed a short-term contract with Germany until the end of the Euros, but in April agreed to stay on until after the 2026 World Cup. He cited the friendlies in March \u2013 and the reaction they evoked across the country \u2013 as reasons for his extension. \u201cThis is a decision of the heart. It is a great honour to be able to train the national team and work with the best players in the country,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cWith successful, passionate performances we have the chance to inspire an entire country. The two wins against France and the Netherlands in March really touched me. We want to play a successful home European Championship together and I\u2019m really looking forward to it together with my coaching team Challenge of a World Cup.\u201d The 36-year-old manager has been bold in his selections for the Euros. Mats Hummels, who starred in Borussia Dortmund\u2019s run to the Champions League final, has been overlooked as has Bayern Munich\u2019s Leon Goretzka. Beyond talent, the Germany squad comprises players in a rich vein of form. Havertz and Wirtz are coming off standout campaigns for Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen respectively. Kroos, meanwhile, has rolled back the years for Madrid with his performances this year, and Rudiger has established himself this season as one of the best defenders in the world. The fact that Germany is the Euro 2024 host is key, not least because qualification might have proved an issue had that not been the case. Home support \u2013 and the manner in which they harness it \u2013 will be crucial to Germany\u2019s chances. Drawn in a tricky group with Switzerland, Scotland and Hungary, a strong start to Euro 2024 will be essential to build momentum. Much like the 2006 World Cup staged in Germany, the Euros could be the dawn of a new era for the national team on home soil \u2013 or, if they crash and burn in front of their legions of fans, there is likely to be a major squad rebuild in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup campaign.

President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call early parliamentary elections in response to his crushing defeat in a European Union vote is a risky gamble that few could have predicted, observers tell Al Jazeera, as they describe the snap polls as a referendum on the far right. Yielding a call from the far-right candidate Jordan Bardella, whose National Rally party won 31.5 percent of the vote in the European Parliament elections on Sunday, Macron dissolved the French Parliament and ordered snap elections. The first round will be held on June 30 and a second on July 7. Analysts said it is a high-stakes attempt to regain credibility after Macron\u2019s liberal Renaissance party trailed behind National Rally in second place with about half its level of support \u2013 just 14.6 percent. According to Gilles Ivaldi, professor at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, or Sciences Po, Macron is hoping the votes of his detractors lack substance. Voting for the National Rally and its firebrand leader Marine Le Pen has traditionally been a way to show dissatisfaction with the government. \u201cNow Macron is telling voters, \u2018We\u2019re playing for real,\u2019\u201d Ivaldi told Al Jazeera. \u201cIt\u2019s not about expressing your discontent. It\u2019s about whether you truly want the far right to be in charge.\u201d Ivaldi, who studies far-right and populist parties at Sciences Po\u2019s Centre for Political Research, said Macron wants voters to think twice before casting a ballot for the National Rally when the far right has a real shot at power. \u201cHe is hoping the fear of the far right will produce some important changes,\u201d including rallying moderate parties to a new majority, he said. But the move, unseen in French politics since 1997, has the potential to backfire. The National Rally not only tapped into discontent with Macron\u2019s government but also built support throughout the years around issues that matter to voters, including migration, security and the economy, Ivaldi said. Le Pen has challenged Macron in the second round of the past two presidential elections, in 2017 and 2022. While Macron ultimately won both votes, his popularity declined while support for Le Pen grew from 34 to 41 percent.      Forecasts by Toluna Harris Interactive for Challenges, M6 and RTL predict the snap elections will result in the National Rally winning the most seats in the lower house of parliament but falling short of an absolute majority. Macron has promised to finish out the remaining three years of his term as president regardless of any outcome. While he will oversee defence and foreign policy, he could lose control of the domestic agenda to the National Rally. This \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 as the situation is known in political jargon \u2013 would give Le Pen\u2019s Russia-leaning, nationalist party the ability to set the tone on issues including the rights of non-French nationals, Ukraine aid and economic reforms. \u201cIt is a gamble, clearly,\u201d Ivaldi said. \u201cNo one saw this coming, and no one knows what will come out of the election.\u201d The far right\u2019s triumphs in the European Parliament elections shook governments across the EU, but nowhere was the defeat more stinging than for the French head of state. Macron\u2019s liberal ruling coalition secured 13 out of the 81 seats allocated to France in the European legislative body. The National Rally bagged 30 seats. The party\u2019s popularity is not a novelty. From the mid-1980s, its voter base has been on the rise, and in the last two European elections, in 2014 and in 2019, it has topped the polls in France. This year, however, the win came with an unprecedented margin. Sebastien Maillard, associate fellow at Chatham House, said National Rally\u2019s strategy to soften its image has been working. \u201cIt used to be an anti-Semitic party, but now it is widely supporting Israel,\u201d Maillard told Al Jazeera. It also abandoned its hostility towards the NATO alliance and the idea of a Frexit \u2013 a French exit from the European Union. The party has also, for the most part, moved past the racist slurs that had characterised the leadership of founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine\u2019s father. Above all, Maillard said, the party\u2019s \u201cnormalisation strategy\u201d revolves around Bardella, a soft-spoken, 28-year-old political phenomenon who took over the leadership of the National Rally in 2022 to allow Le Pen to prepare for her next bid for the presidency. With 1.2 million followers on TikTok, Bardella is attracting a younger crowd to the party. He has successfully honed his image as the son of a poor family of Italian origin who grew up in the Paris suburbs but beat the odds and climbed to the top of the political ladder. While exuding humility and avoiding controversies, Bardella touts the party\u2019s hardline anti-immigration message, which prioritises security and keeping \u201cFrance for the French\u201d. If the National Rally wins a majority in parliament, he could be named prime minister. According to some polls, he is among the politicians seen most favourably as a successor to Macron. Le Pen has led the party\u2019s rebrand, but the movement lacks \u201ca clear programme\u201d, Maillard said. \u201cThis is what Macron\u2019s snap election is about, forcing the National Rally to speak out on what they want so that the French can see how dangerous it is.\u201d Dissolving parliament was the \u201cnuclear\u201d option, he added, but perhaps a necessary move to contain festering discontent. \u201cThe National Rally turned the EU election into a referendum on Macron. Now Macron is turning the snap election into a referendum on the far right.\u201d               Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Qaanitah Hunter","title":"South Africa\u2019s Ramaphosa secures ruling coalition, but allies hold veto","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2024\/6\/14\/south-africas-ramaphosa-secures-ruling-coalition-but-allies-hold-veto","description":"An 11th hour deal between the ANC and traditional rivals has led to the country\u2019s first coalition government.","date":"2024-06-14T14:22:10Z","content":"An 11th hour deal between the ANC and traditional rivals has led to the country\u2019s first coalition government. The hard part starts now, say analysts. Cape Town, South Africa \u2013 Late-night negotiations and an eleventh-hour agreement led to the formation of South Africa\u2019s first-ever coalition government on Friday, with President Cyril Ramaphosa at its head. The multiparty coalition signed its agreement only on Friday, as members of parliament were sworn in after marathon negotiations and back-and-forth calls between Ramaphosa and leaders of other parties. Late Friday night, Ramaphosa was elected as the country\u2019s president in parliament. Under the unprecedented coalition agreement, the Democratic Alliance (DA) \u2013 the African National Congress\u2019s (ANC) official opposition until now \u2013 and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) voted for an ANC president for the first time. The multiparty coalition was prompted after the ANC suffered its worst electoral decline in 30 years. The party holds 159 of 400 seats in parliament \u2013 short of the 201 seats needed to have a majority \u2013 after winning 40 percent of the vote in the country\u2019s May 29 election. After days of internal talks within the ANC, Ramaphosa announced last week that the party would seek a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d. But the left-leaning Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe (MK Party) \u2013 which was created months before the election and ate into the ANC\u2019s traditional voter support \u2013 refused to join the government, especially with the DA a part of it. The MK Party had also demanded Ramaphosa\u2019s removal from the presidency.  The right-leaning DA, with 21 percent of the seats in parliament, will now be the ANC\u2019s main partner in government with the support of the nationalist IFP. The parties agreed to an eight-page framework that will govern their unity government, including a clause stating that a decision could only be made if \u201csufficient consensus\u201d was reached. This means that Ramaphosa and the ANC will not be able to make decisions without buy-in from coalition partners. The parties agreed to 10 fundamental principles, which included respect for the constitution, and positions against racism and sexism. In the agreement signed, the parties agreed that \u201crapid, inclusive and sustainable economic growth\u201d would be the coalition government\u2019s apex priority. Former DA leader and negotiating team member Tony Leon said that he had never imagined a world where the ANC and the DA would co-govern. \u201cThe last time I negotiated with the ANC around the new constitution was in 1996, and they had 62 percent support,\u201d he told Al Jazeera. Leon described the talks since the May 29 vote as \u201cvery hard\u201d, but said the president\u2019s election was the \u201ceasy part\u201d. \u201cThe next five years are going to be difficult,\u201d he said, adding that trust would make the coalition government functional. Leon said talks were still incomplete five minutes before parliament\u2019s sitting began on Friday at 10am local time (08:00 GMT). \u201cWe agreed to outline a modality of how you get through today and some signals and signposts of the future. It is about some broad principles and important provisions; at the end of the day, this will not just depend on goodwill. It will depend on trust between the parties,\u201d he said. The agreement signed on Friday morning did not include details on which parties will occupy what positions in government. Ramaphosa has until Wednesday to determine that. He will be sworn in by the country\u2019s chief justice next Wednesday. According to the agreement signed, while Ramaphosa has the prerogative to appoint ministers and deputy ministers, he needs to consult leaders of other parties in the coalition before he does so. Pierre de Vos, professor of constitutional law at the University of Cape Town, said he was wary about what a coalition government might mean for the country\u2019s governance. \u201cIt is difficult to be confident in what\u2019s to come,\u201d he said. De Vos said that while a coalition government was \u201cgood on paper,\u201d South Africa had a fractious society that the ANC kept together for three decades. \u201cWhen it comes to difficult issues like inequality and racism, the two parties are polar opposite sides,\u201d he said. The DA has fought against race-based transformation policies, which the ANC has pushed for three decades. Other analysts said they believe the coalition government would force ideological parties to the centre. \u201cThis coalition agreement is a good thing. It will force the ANC away from the left to the centre and the DA away from the extreme right,\u201d said political analyst JP Landman.

The top court in military-governed Niger has lifted the immunity of the country\u2019s deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, paving the way for a possible trial nearly a year after he was overthrown by mutinous soldiers. Abdou Dan Galadima, president of the State Court, the country\u2019s highest legal authority that was created in November by the military government, announced the decision on Friday. The military authorities had initiated the legal proceedings earlier this year, declaring their intention to eventually prosecute Bazoum for \u201chigh treason\u201d and for undermining national security. Under house arrest with his family, Bazoum is accused of having spoken by telephone with French President Emmanuel Macron and United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a bid to secure Western support during the July 2023 coup. The court proceedings were postponed twice, with Bazoum\u2019s lawyers complaining of several obstacles to the right of a defence. They have been unable to communicate with him since last October. Human Rights Watch, an international rights group, has alleged the hearing was marred by serious irregularities, including violations of Bazoum\u2019s rights to present evidence in his defence, to communicate with his legal counsel and to be heard before an independent court.      Late last year, the highest court of West African regional bloc ECOWAS\u00a0ruled that Bazoum and his family were arbitrarily detained and called for him to be released and restored to office. Niger pulled out of the grouping a month later. After Friday\u2019s hearing, Ould Salem Mohamed, one of Bazoum\u2019s lawyers, said they took note of the decision and that the defence team would make a statement shortly. Before Bazoum was forcibly removed from power, Niger was the West\u2019s last major security partner in the Sahel, the vast region south of the Sahara desert that has for years been gripped by deadly violence perpetrated by armed groups. Bazoum, a former teacher, was elected in 2021 \u2013 the country\u2019s first-ever peaceful transfer of power since independence in 1960. Lauded for his democratic credentials, he offered a base for powers like France and the US to launch security campaigns against armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. The military government has since booted out France\u2019s military. US troops were also ordered to leave and have officially started their withdrawal.

The United Nations has warned that the global fight against female genital mutilation (FGM) is being undermined by families crossing borders to have girls undergo the procedure. A report from the UN human rights office, published on Friday, found that FGM continues across the world despite bans, largely owing to the \u201cclandestine\u201d practice of taking girls abroad to countries where the practice is legal or where laws criminalising it are not enforced. \u201cFemale genital mutilation is part of a continuum of gender-based violence and has no place in a human rights-respecting universe,\u201d UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. Gender stereotypes and patriarchal norms anchoring and perpetuating the practice needed to be uprooted, he added. The office called for concerted global action to tackle cross-border and transnational FGM, zeroing in on so-called \u201cvacation cutting\u201d, particularly prevalent among families in Europe and North America, who take their daughters to their countries of origin to undergo the procedure during school holidays. Though most countries in Africa have criminalised the practice, the report said some were serving as \u201ctransnational FGM hubs\u201d. In some cases, the cutters are moving across borders to carry out the procedure. Turk called for countries to address the root causes and the consequences of FGM by harmonising legal and policy frameworks and enforcing them. FGM is banned in more than 70 countries, of which at least 35 are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank. The Gambia \u2013 where government figures show that 73 percent of women aged between 15 and 49 have undergone genital mutilation \u2013 could be the first country to lift a ban. The UN children\u2019s agency UNICEF defines FGM as \u201cthe partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\u201d. It can lead to serious health problems, including infections, bleeding, infertility and complications in childbirth, and impairs sexual pleasure. The report said the exact number of girls who have been subjected to cross-border or transnational\u00a0female\u00a0genital\u00a0mutilation\u00a0remained unknown due to its clandestine nature. According to UNICEF, more than 230 million girls and women have been subjected to\u00a0genital\u00a0mutilation, including more than 144 million in Africa and more than 80 million in Asia. \u201cIf the practice continues at the current pace, an estimated 68 million girls will undergo FGM between 2015 and 2030,\u201d the report said.

The endangered sandy brown horses once roamed across Central Asia. They were named after Russian geographer Nikolay Przewalski, who discovered them in the late 19th century, by which time their range had been reduced to only one part of western Mongolia. Now, the Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic, which manages the studbook for the species, wants to begin returning them to the Altyn Dala, or Golden Steppe, region of central Kazakhstan, a vast area of grassland and wetlands covering some 7,000 square kilometres (2,700 square miles). In early June, the first group of seven arrived. On Thursday, four others landed in Arkalyk.\u00a0 About 40 more are planned for the next five years. \u201cThis is an event of historical import, the seven Przewalski\u2019s that we transported here by two CASA planes represent the first individuals of this species in central Kazakhstan in hundreds of years,\u201d said Prague Zoo director Miroslav Bobek. Czech army planes transported the horses \u2013 a stallion and six mares \u2013 on flights from Prague and Berlin to the Kazakh city of Arkalyk, from where they travelled seven hours by truck, accompanied by zoo keepers. Thursday morning, a Czech Army CASA aircraft landed in Arkalyk, central Kazakhstan, with four more Przewalski\u2019s horses. Just before 5pm local time, the mares, Tessa, Wespe, Umbra and Sary, were released into an acclimatisation pen in the Altyn Dala area.https:\/\/t.co\/O6Qtknmdr4 pic.twitter.com\/0NojI1Fqq0 \u2014 Prague Zoo (@prague_zoo) June 7, 2024  The horses will stay in an acclimatisation enclosure for a year to learn to find water and food during the steppe\u2019s harsh winters. Przewalski\u2019s horses had disappeared from the wild by the end of the 1960s but remained in captivity. They have already been reintroduced in China and western Mongolia, where the population now numbers 850. In Kazakhstan, the reintroduction is part of conservation efforts \u2013 the horses eat a wide variety of grasses, in turn spreading seeds. \u201cIt is quite important to have these wild horses,\u201d said Albert Salemgareyev, lead specialist for the Association for the Conversation of Biodiversity in Kazakhstan.

Cyril Ramaphosa has been re-elected as South Africa\u2019s president for a second term after his party struck a last-minute deal with political rivals. Ramaphosa\u2019s African National Congress, which came to power in 1994 after waging a decades-long battle against apartheid, lost its majority for the first time in an election last month and spent two weeks locked in intensive behind-the-scenes talks with other parties. As the newly elected parliament convened on Friday, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen said his white-led main opposition party formally signed a governing agreement with the ANC and part of it would make Ramaphosa president. In a secret ballot hours later during a marathon parliamentary session, Ramaphosa secured his second term with the help of lawmakers from the DA and some smaller parties. The 71-year-old was re-elected by fellow MPs with 283 votes, seeing off a surprise challenge by Julius Malema, the firebrand leader of the radical left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), whose candidacy gained 44 votes. Ramaphosa called the deal a \u201cnew birth, a new era for our country\u201d and said it was time for parties \u201cto overcome their differences and to work together\u201d. \u201cThis is what we shall do and this is what I am committed to achieve as the president,\u201d added Ramaphosa. The National Assembly had earlier elected a DA lawmaker as deputy speaker, after choosing an ANC politician as speaker \u2013 the first concrete instance of power sharing between the two parties.  The deal sent South Africa into uncharted waters. Politics in the country has been dominated by the ANC since it swept to power in the 1994 elections following the end of apartheid. But late freedom fighter Nelson Mandela\u2019s party, long seen as unbeatable in national elections, lost support in recent years as voters wearied of persistently high levels of poverty, inequality and crime, rolling power cuts and corruption in party ranks. Ramaphosa will be sworn in next week in Pretoria and then unveil his new cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s expected President Ramaphosa will make a number of concessions when appointing cabinet ministers, giving some of those posts to the political parties in the new partnership,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Cape Town. \u201cThat trade-off for the support of what was the ANC\u2019s largest opponent, many hope, won\u2019t come at a high cost.\u201d The DA has previously often opposed ANC policies related to economic, labour, healthcare and foreign policy decisions, including workers\u2019 rights to South Africa\u2019s stance on supporting Palestine. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not really an issue of legally enforcing the agreement, the agreement is there as part of the process to build trust between what is now apparently going to be coalition parties,\u201d constitutional expert Pierre de Vos told Al Jazeera. \u201cWhether it will work or not we really don\u2019t know.\u201d      The parliament session started at 10am in the unusual setting of a conference centre near Cape Town\u2019s waterfront, after the city\u2019s historic National Assembly building was gutted in a fire in 2022. The House first went through the hourslong swearing-in of hundreds of new lawmakers and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker. The vote for president started late at night, with the results announced well after 10pm Ramaphosa finished his acceptance speech as the clock ticked past midnight and into Saturday. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s MK Party boycotted the session but that did not affect the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said the party was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government. There are 18 political parties represented in parliament and he said the multiparty agreement would \u201cprioritise the country across the political and ideological divide.\u201d Some parties, including Malema\u2019s EFF, refused to join. The two other parties that joined the coalition deal were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention partly because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery. McKenzie said he had been given a second chance in life and that South Africa also had one now, a chance to solve its deep socioeconomic problems.

In their statement, the G7 leaders repeated concern at the \u201cunacceptable number of civilian casualties\u201d in the war. They again endorsed a truce and captive release deal. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the consequences on the civilian population of the ongoing ground operations in Rafah, and the possibility of a full-scale military offensive that would have further dire consequences for civilians.

Hopes must become reality, the time for talking is done.\u201d\u00a0  On Friday, the G7 nations turned their attention to migration, artificial intelligence, economic security and the Asia-Pacific region. Their leaders stressed their determination to meet global challenges \u201cat a crucial moment in history\u201d. The gathering in a luxury resort in Italy\u2019s southern Puglia (Apulia) region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, climate change, Iran, the situation in the Red Sea, gender equality, and China\u2019s industrial policy and economic security. \u201cWe are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time,\u201d the final communique said. Migration was the first topic of discussions on Friday with the leaders mulling ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from which refugees and migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys. The topic is of particular interest to summit host Italy, which lies on one of the major routes into the European Union for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Right-wing Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, known for her hardline stance on migration, has been eager to increase investment and funding for African nations as a means of reducing migratory pressure on Europe. The leaders \u201claunched the G7 Coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants\u201d, the summit\u2019s final declaration said, noting the seven nations would \u201cfocus on the root causes of irregular migration, efforts to enhance border management and curb transnational organized crime, and safe and regular pathways for migration.\u201d Apart from the G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States, the Italian hosts also invited several African leaders \u2013 Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied \u2013 to press Meloni\u2019s migration and development initiatives. But rights groups decried what they said was a lack of ambition in support for developing countries. The ONE Campaign, which advocates for investment in Africa, said it had found the G7\u2019s and European Union\u2019s share of aid going to Africa was at its lowest point since 1973. \u201cWithout any concrete action, the G7 in Italy amounts to no more than pointless platitudes,\u201d said David McNair, executive director at the ONE Campaign. Although the summit\u2019s final statement \u201creflects promises of increased partnership between the G7 and Africa, there are very few specifics on what new financing, if any, will be available\u201d.

The United States Supreme Court declared a federal ban on \u201cbump stock\u201d devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly unlawful, rejecting yet another firearms restriction. In a six-to-three ruling on Friday, the justices upheld a lower court\u2019s decision siding with a gun shop owner and gun-rights advocate who challenged the ban by claiming a US agency improperly interpreted a federal law prohibiting machineguns as extending to bump stocks. The conservative justices were in the majority, with the liberal justices dissenting. The rule was imposed in 2019 by the administration of former President Donald Trump after the devices were used during a 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival. President Joe Biden cited the 2017 incident decrying the top court\u2019s decision. \u201cToday\u2019s decision strikes down an important gun safety regulation. Americans should not have to live in fear of this mass devastation,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWe know thoughts and prayers are not enough. I call on Congress to ban bump stocks, pass an assault weapon ban, and take additional action to save lives \u2013 send me a bill and I will sign it immediately.\u201d For years, the US has suffered from major gun violence problems, including mass shootings. The country has seen 251 mass shootings so far this year, according to the website Gun Violence Archive. Gun attacks killed 18,854 people in the United States last year.      Still, conservative Republicans often oppose government restriction on access to firearms, arguing that owning guns is a legal right enshrined in the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said after Friday\u2019s ruling, \u201cThe court has spoken and their decision should be respected.\u201d Leavitt called the former president, who is challenging Biden in the presidential elections in November, a \u201cfierce defender\u201d of gun rights. The case centred on how the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a US Department of Justice agency, interpreted a federal law, which defined machineguns as weapons that can \u201cautomatically\u201d fire more than one shot \u201cby a single function of the trigger\u201d. \u201cWe hold that a semi-automatic rifle equipped with a bump stock is not a \u2018machine gun\u2019 because it cannot fire more than one shot \u2018by a single function of the trigger\u2019,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Clarence\u00a0Thomas wrote. \u201cAnd, even if it could, it would not do so \u2018automatically.\u2019 ATF, therefore, exceeded its statutory authority by issuing a rule that classifies bump stocks as machine guns.\u201d Federal law prohibits the sale or possession of machineguns, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Bump stocks use a semi-automatic\u2019s recoil to allow it to slide back and forth while \u201cbumping\u201d the shooter\u2019s trigger finger, resulting in rapid fire. Federal officials said the rule was needed to protect public safety in a nation facing persistent firearms violence.

Washington, DC \u2013 The United States has imposed sanctions on a \u201cviolent extremist\u201d Israeli group for blocking and damaging humanitarian aid convoys to Gaza as the risk of famine increases in the besieged Palestinian territory. The administration of President Joe Biden on Friday targeted Tzav 9, a group whose stated aim is to prevent any assistance from entering Gaza. It accused the group of looting and setting fire to aid trucks. \u201cThe provision of humanitarian assistance is vital to preventing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from worsening and to mitigating the risk of famine,\u201d the Department of State said in a statement. \u201cThe government of Israel has a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank en route to Gaza. We will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance.\u201d The sanctions were announced a day after Israeli media outlets cited Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai as saying far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pushed to prevent law enforcement from protecting aid convoys to Gaza. For months, right-wing Israelis have been protesting and blocking roads to prevent aid shipments from reaching Gaza, which is under a suffocating Israeli blockade. The efforts have further strained the flow of desperately needed aid to the territory.      In recent weeks, the protesters have stepped up their attacks on convoys, especially as they go through the occupied West Bank. Last month, they set two aid trucks alight in the Hebron Hills area, an attack the US State Department blamed on Tzav 9. The sanctions block the group\u2019s assets in the US and largely prohibit American citizens from engaging in transactions with them. They were imposed under an executive order (EO) issued by Biden that set up a legal framework for US penalties against individuals and entities \u201cundermining peace, security and stability\u201d in the occupied West Bank. Last week, the Biden administration invoked the same order to sanction the Lion\u2019s Den, a Palestinian armed group. Still, Washington has resisted calls to penalise Israeli officials responsible for abuses against Palestinians in the West Bank, including Ben-Gvir and ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. This month, US Senator Chris Van Hollen urged the Biden administration to use the executive order to target Smotrich. \u201cIn my view, Smotrich should be subject to sanctions under this EO,\u201d Van Hollen said. The finance minister has withheld taxes owed to the Palestinian Authority, and in March, he declared 800 hectares (1,977 acres) in the West Bank to be Israeli state land. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this person whose stated goal is for essentially Israel to take over the entire West Bank,\u201d Van Hollen told the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.      Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), an advocacy organisation that recommended sanctioning Tzav 9, welcomed Friday\u2019s measures and called on Biden to target entities and individuals that help fund and enable the group as well. \u201cRecent revelations that Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir ordered police to stand down and allow Tzav 9 to block humanitarian aid convoys show how this despicable strategy of starvation is coordinated from young settler activists all the way up to the highest levels of the Israeli government,\u201d Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, director of research for Israel-Palestine at DAWN, said in a statement. \u201cThe US should not continue to ignore Israeli government involvement in these crimes and should apply sanctions to Ben-Gvir next.\u201d Rights advocates also called on Washington to pressure Israel to lift its siege on Gaza. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that Israel has taken \u201cimportant steps\u201d in recent months to remove obstacles to aid deliveries in Gaza, but he acknowledged it \u201ccan and must do more\u201d. \u201cIt is crucial to speed up the inspection of trucks and reduce backlogs, to provide greater clarity on \u2013 and shorten the list of \u2013 prohibited goods, to increase visas for aid workers and to process them more quickly,\u201d he said at a Gaza aid conference in Jordan on Tuesday. Blinken also urged \u201cclearer, more effective channels\u201d to protect humanitarian workers from military operations.

Spain reached the semifinals of Euro 2020, where they were knocked out on penalties by eventual champions Italy. In June 2023, they won the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Nations League \u2013 their first title since the team\u2019s memorable Euro 2012 triumph. The Nations League victory was significant for three main reasons. First, beating Croatia in the final on penalties exorcised the demons of the 2022 Qatar World Cup, where Spain shockingly failed to score a single penalty in their round of 16 exit to Morocco. Second, there were huge volts of confidence from a late win over Italy in the Nations League semifinal and beating Italy and Croatia, both of whom are in the same Euro 2024 group as Spain. Third, new Spain manager Luis de la Fuente getting a taste of silverware early into his reign ensured buy-in from his players as they head into Euro 2024. De la Fuente is no stranger to success with the national team. He won the Euros with the Spanish Under-19 and Under-23 teams and was in charge of the national side that won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. So, it comes as no surprise that the squad he\u2019s picked for Euro 2024 is young and hungry for success. Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal, 16, has made the cut while fellow La Masia graduate Fermin Lopez, 21, has earned his first call-up to the national side. Twenty-one-year-olds Pedri and Nico Williams also feature in De la Fuente\u2019s 26-man squad. Yamal is almost certain to start for Spain at Euro 2024 and in doing so, he\u2019ll become the youngest-ever player to make an appearance at the European championship. The sublimely talented winger has already set a list of extraordinary records in his young career: youngest scorer for his club team Barcelona, youngest scorer in LaLiga history and youngest scorer for the Spanish national team. While Yamal is the main attraction in this Spain side, its most important player is Manchester City star, Rodri. The 27-year-old defensive midfielder has emerged as the de facto leader of the national side. His partnership in the midfield with Real Sociedad\u2019s Martin Zubimendi \u2013 a duo De la Fuente dubbed the \u201cbest midfielders in the world in their position\u201d \u2013 will be key to Spain\u2019s chances at the Euros. Villarreal\u2019s Alex Baena, who has the most assists in the LaLiga this season, and Aleix Garcia, a key member in Girona\u2019s Champions League qualifying campaign, are other sound options for De la Fuente to call upon in midfield. Center forward is an area of concern for Spain. Alvaro Morata will lead the line in Germany, but the Atletico Madrid forward\u2019s form has tailed off after a strong start to the season. He has scored just twice since the start of March. Joselu has managed a respectable 17 goals for Real Madrid this season, including a stunning brace against Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinal, but he\u2019s far from being a bankable option in international match play. Given the makeup of the Spain squad, which along with being youth heavy also includes seven players above the age of 30, it\u2019s tough to predict which way their campaign will swing. Entering Euro 2024 in Germany as a near-unknown entity under a new manager making his major tournament debut could end up working in Spain\u2019s favour.

What does that say?","date":"2024-06-14T06:39:23Z","content":"In Kashmir and Punjab, candidates jailed for being alleged national security threats have won. What does that say? New Delhi, India \u2013 On the afternoon of June 4, a crowd of several hundred young men gathered in front of a two-storey house in Mawar village, with a clear view of the Pir Panjal mountains in the background, in Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s Kupwara district. Some of those in the crowd raised a man over their shoulders who shouted, \u201cTihar ka jawab [the answer to Tihar jail]\u201d, to which the crowd replied, \u201cVote se [the vote],\u201d as women peeked through windows and children scaled the brick boundary wall around the house for a glimpse of the action. The crowd was celebrating the victory of jailed engineer-turned-politician Abdul Rashid Sheikh, also known as \u201cEngineer Rashid,\u201d who won the Baramulla seat in Kashmir, securing nearly half a million votes. He defeated candidates from both major pro-India political parties in the disputed region \u2013 former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, and Sajjad Gani Lone, a separatist turned mainstream politician from the Jammu and Kashmir People\u2019s Conference. An independent candidate beating opponents from major parties is rare enough \u2013 only seven of the 543 candidates elected winners in India\u2019s just-concluded national vote ran as independents.\u00a0 But Rashid did something ever rarer: he contested and won from Delhi\u2019s Tihar jail, which is approximately 850km (528 miles) away. The 58-year-old politician was arrested after New Delhi scrapped Kashmir\u2019s special status and statehood on August 5, 2019. He faces charges of \u201cterror funding\u201d under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, an anti-terror law declared \u201cdraconian\u201d by several rights groups. India\u2019s National Investigation Agency (NIA) charged Rashid in March 2022 with allegedly instigating Jammu and Kashmir police personnel against the Indian Army. He was also accused of receiving funds from Pakistan. He has denied the charges. Rashid is not alone. Some 485km (300 miles) away in Khadoor Sahib in the northwestern state of Punjab, voters elected 31-year-old Amritpal Singh, who has advocated for a separate Sikh homeland, to parliament. Singh, like Rashid, contested from jail \u2013 in his case, a high-security prison in Assam, in the northeast corner of India. Singh, who is facing 12 criminal charges, was arrested by the Punjab police in April 2023 and charged under the National Security Act (NSA), which allows those considered a threat to national security to be detained without charge for up to a year. On June 4, as the results of India\u2019s election were announced, Singh won by 400,000 votes. The shock wins for Rashid and Singh represent a sharp message to mainstream Indian opposition parties, even as they suggest that people\u2019s trust in the institutions of the Indian state has taken a hit in Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir, regions that have witnessed anger against the ruling government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, say analysts. \u201cThe space for mainstream parties is crucial. They serve as a bridge to national integration,\u201d said Asim Ali, a political commentator. But in both Baramulla and Khadoor Sahib, voters concluded that these parties \u2013 many of which had been past alliance partners of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party \u2013 were not trustworthy, he said. \u201cPeople do not regard them as autonomous parties or credible choices. So, if there is no legitimate alternative in democracy, persons on the fringes gain political space,\u201d Ali said. India has long considered a rebellion against New Delhi\u2019s rule in Indian-administered Kashmir as a form of terrorism and has deployed millions of its soldiers in the region for decades. New Delhi claims the region as an integral part of the country. Rashid worked as a construction engineer before he quit his job in 2008 and joined politics, winning that year\u2019s assembly elections from the Langate seat in his hometown as an independent candidate and again in 2014, as a candidate of Awami Ittehad Party, which he formed a year earlier. Regarded by his supporters as a \u201ccommon man\u201d who leads a low-profile life, Rashid has routinely demanded accountability for alleged rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and abductions, by India\u2019s security forces in Kashmir. At the same time, he dissuaded youth from his constituency from throwing stones at Indian forces in 2010 during a period of heightened civil unrest in the region. Kashmir witnessed a much higher turnout of voters this year than it has in the previous two decades with many concluding that casting their vote against the BJP was their only way to be heard by New Delhi. Those sentiments appear to have crystallised in Rashid\u2019s favour in Baramulla. Tariq Ahmad, 35, a resident of Pattan in the Baramulla district, had never voted before. This time, he voted for Rashid. \u201cHe is in jail, and we feel that this is the only way we can show our solidarity and support for him, through our democratic right,\u201d Ahmad said. Rashid\u2019s two sons \u2013 Abrar Rashid, 23, and Asrar Rashid, 19 \u2013 appealed to voters to avenge their father\u2019s arrest by going out to vote. They drew large crowds, particularly young people in northern Kashmir, an area prone to armed unrest. Abrar said his father\u2019s victory is also for other Kashmiris imprisoned in other parts of India. \u201cIt is very tough for families whose kin are in jail. He can be the voice of those innocent people who are languishing in jail for no reason. He is in jail, and no one can understand the miseries of being jailed better than us. My father can be their voice,\u201d Abrar told Al Jazeera. Abrar said people came forward to campaign for his father. \u201cIt was all voluntary and spontaneous. I just paid 27,000 rupees [$322] for petrol,\u201d he said. Rashid has petitioned a Delhi court for interim bail to take his oath as a member of parliament. According to analyst Siddiq Wahid, Rashid\u2019s supporters turned out essentially to vote in a referendum against the August 2019 removal of Kashmir\u2019s special status and the months-long crackdown that followed, when even the internet was suspended. \u201cRashid\u2019s election means that Kashmir\u2019s voice and its aspiration for political justice for all its peoples are alive and well,\u201d Wahid said. Kashmir-based political analysts told Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity that Rashid\u2019s victory should not be read as a \u201cseparatist victory\u201d but rather as a victory for democracy in Kashmir. They argued that the large voter turnout was also due to an absence of threats from armed groups as well as pro-vote messaging from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which enjoys substantial support in the region. Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir remains banned, but one of its leaders recently met Home Minister Amit Shah. In the Khadoor Sahab constituency of the northern state of Punjab, too, it was a democratic vote that has brought Sikh leader Amritpal Singh a win and a seat in India\u2019s parliament. On June 8, Singh\u2019s parents distributed sweets to guards and jail staff at the high-security prison in Assam where he is being held to celebrate their son\u2019s victory. \u201cWe are very happy. Now we just want Amritpal to be released, so that he can take an oath,\u201d Tarsem Singh, Amritpal\u2019s father, told Al Jazeera. Some experts view Singh\u2019s victory with concern. Last year, Singh was accused of supporting the Khalistani separatist cause. But his supporters said the young Sikh leader simply advocates for religious adherence and tackling drug usage among Punjabi youth. Sikhs are a religious minority in India who make up about 58 percent of Punjab\u2019s population. The border state witnessed an armed separatist movement during the 1980s. In recent years, the state, known as India\u2019s bread basket, has found itself in the grip of a drug crisis. Singh is not the only candidate linked to Sikh separatism who won in Punjab. Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa, the son of one of the assassins of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, won as an independent from Faridkot as the state\u2019s Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) suffered a massive defeat. Shamshair Singh Warriach, a journalist and political analyst based in Punjab, ruled out that the vote was for \u201csecessionism\u201d. \u201cPeople voted for Amritpal because he is now involved in democratic politics,\u201d he said, adding that they support Singh only for his anti-drug activism. But Singh\u2019s win also comes at a time when the Modi government has been engaged in both domestic and international sparring over Sikh separatism. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi\u2019s government has intensified the pursuit of Sikh separatists and arrested dozens of leaders with alleged links to the Khalistan movement. As Punjab farmers took to the streets in recent years to protest against Modi government laws, sections of the BJP and its supporters suggested that the protesters were in many cases Khalistan sympathisers. Meanwhile, the Canadian government and United States prosecutors have accused Indian intelligence agencies of involvement in assassination plots against Sikh leaders on their soil. New Delhi has denied the allegations, though it has agreed to probe the US allegations. According to Aditya Menon, political editor of the Quint, a Delhi-based news website, Singh and Khalsa appear to be beneficiaries of broader dissatisfaction with mainstream parties in Punjab. More broadly, he argued, Rashid, Singh and Khalsa have not won in a vacuum. \u201cWe must also note that in the recent decade, there has been a rise of hardline Hindu nationalism and radicalism with the ascent of the BJP, so it\u2019s only natural that there would be a counter-assertion,\u201d he said. \u00a0          Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":null,"title":"Saudi robots join millions for the Hajj","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/program\/newsfeed\/2024\/6\/14\/saudi-robots-join-millions-for-the-hajj","description":"Saudi Arabia has deployed robots in the holy cities of Medina and Mecca to help pilgrims undertaking the Hajj.","date":"2024-06-14T08:38:36Z","content":"Saudi Arabia has deployed robots in the holy cities of Medina and Mecca to help pilgrims undertaking the Hajj.

On Friday, the pontiff was the first head of the Roman Catholic Church to ever attend a Group of Seven meeting. \u201cIn light of the tragedy that is armed conflict, it is urgent to reconsider the development and use of devices like the so-called \u2018lethal autonomous weapons\u2019 and ultimately ban their use,\u201d the pope said. \u201cThis starts from an effective and concrete commitment to introduce ever greater and proper human control.

Pope Francis, 87, who has suffered from mobility issues in recent years, arrived in Puglia by helicopter and was welcomed by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He told the leaders gathered in the southern Italian region, \u201cArtificial intelligence [is] at the same time an exciting and fearsome tool. We would condemn humanity to a future without hope if we took away people\u2019s ability to make decisions about themselves and their lives, by dooming them to depend on the choices of machines.\u201d The Argentinian pontiff was speaking after a series of bilateral meetings with leaders including Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a statement on his social media platforms, Zelenskyy said he and Pope Francis talked about the upcoming summit on Ukraine on Saturday and Sunday. \u201cWe discussed the consequences of Russian aggression against Ukraine, Russian air terror and the difficult situation in the energy sector \u2026 and expectations from the Global Peace Summit,\u201d Zelenskyy said.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has rejected a French initiative aimed at defusing the growing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah as fears of an all-out war between the two sides grow. Gallant said on Friday that Israel would not take part in a French-proposed trilateral group with the United States and France as he slammed Paris\u2019s position on the war on Gaza. \u201cAs we fight a just war, defending our people, France has adopted hostile policies against Israel,\u201d Gallant said in a statement. \u201cIn doing so, France ignores the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli children, women and men. Israel will not be a party to the trilateral framework proposed by France.\u201d It was unclear whether Gallant, who is the subject of a war crimes investigation by International Criminal Court prosecutors, was speaking for the entire Israeli government or his own office. Israeli ministers have sometimes released contradictory statements on the same subject, including recently on whether the country accepts the US proposal for an \u201cenduring\u201d ceasefire in Gaza. Later on Friday, several Israeli media outlets said officials from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Gallant\u2019s statement against France, calling it \u201cincorrect and inappropriate\u201d.      Paris has repeatedly denounced Hamas\u2019s deadly October 7 attacks in Israel, but it has also criticised the Israeli offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza and called on the country to respect international humanitarian law. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians since October 7. French President Emmanuel Macron put forward the Lebanon proposal on Thursday after days of escalation at the Lebanese-Israeli border. France, which enjoys close relations with Lebanon, has tried to advance a negotiated resolution. \u201cWith the United States, we agreed on the principle of a trilateral [contact group] \u2013 Israel, the United States and France \u2013 to advance on the roadmap that we proposed, and we will do the same with the Lebanese authorities,\u201d Macron said. In February, Paris presented a plan to end hostilities that would see Hezbollah withdraw 10km (6 miles) from the border, Israel halt its attacks on southern Lebanon and negotiations over disputed border areas. Hezbollah has said any diplomatic agreement can materialise only after an end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The Lebanese organisation started attacking military bases in northern Israel after the outbreak of the war on Gaza in what it says is a \u201csupport front\u201d to back Palestinian armed groups. Israel responded by bombing villages across southern Lebanon and targeting Hezbollah positions. Despite the near-daily exchanges of fire, the confrontations have largely been limited to the border area. But cross-border clashes have intensified in recent weeks, raising the prospects of a major war. On Thursday, Hezbollah said it fired 150 rockets and launched 30 suicide drones at Israeli military positions in response to the killing of one of its top commanders this week. Later that day, an Israeli air raid killed two women and injured 15 other civilians in the southern Lebanese village of Jinata.      Hezbollah announced several military operations against Israel on Friday, including claiming a rocket attack against a building housing Israeli soldiers. Tens of thousands of people in southern Lebanon and northern Israel have fled their homes to escape the violence. Hezbollah says it is ready for war if Israel launches a major attack. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have pledged to push Hezbollah fighters farther away from the country\u2019s border. US and Western officials have warned against an escalation in Lebanon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work to try to advance calm in the north of Israel and achieve a diplomatic resolution that would allow the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes and the tens of thousands of Lebanese who have been displaced from their homes to return home,\u201d US Department of State spokesman Matthew Miller said on Thursday. \u201cWe continue to believe \u2026 a ceasefire in Gaza is the best way to achieve that diplomatic resolution.\u201d           Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Al Jazeera","title":"US expands Russia sanctions, targeting entities in China, UAE and Turkey","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/economy\/2024\/6\/13\/us-expands-russia-sanctions-targeting-entities-in-china-uae-and-turkey","description":"Washington's latest sanctions announcement comes as US President Joe Biden attends the G7 summit in Italy.","date":"2024-06-13T05:15:39Z","content":"Washington\u2019s latest sanctions announcement comes as US President Joe Biden attends the G7 summit in Italy. The United States has rolled out new sanctions against more than 300 individuals and firms accused of aiding Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine, including entities in China, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday the measures target Moscow\u2019s remaining avenues for obtaining materials and equipment needed to sustain the war. \u201cWe are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia\u2019s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia\u2019s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services. Every day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine,\u201d Yellen said in a statement. In remarks carried by Russia\u2019s state-run TASS news agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would \u201cnot leave such aggressive actions without a response\u201d. The targeted entities include the Moscow Exchange, which runs Russia\u2019s largest public markets for equities and foreign exchange products, UAE-based firm Red Coast Metals Trading, and Chinese companies Hangzhou Keming Intelligent Technology and Shandong Oree Laser Technology. White House national security spokesman John Kirby earlier in the week told reporters that Washington would \u201cconfront China\u2019s non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers\u201d. China has forged closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine, but has repeatedly denied supplying weapons to Moscow. Under the latest measures, Washington will also broaden its definition of \u201cmilitary-industrial base\u201d to apply so-called secondary sanctions to foreign financial institutions that do business with any sanctioned entities. The US Department of Commerce separately announced that it had blacklisted eight addresses in Hong Kong in a bid to disrupt shell companies believed to be diverting semiconductors to Russia. The announcement of the latest sanctions came as US President Joe Biden arrived in Italy to take part in the annual G7 summit. The summit, which gathers the leaders of major economies including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan, is expected to focus on ways to bolster support for Ukraine and bring about a ceasefire in Gaza.

The lawsuit accuses Musk of overseeing a \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d and \u201c\u2018Animal House\u2019 environment\u201d, with women evaluated on their bra size and bombarded with sexual banter. The suit references a number of Musk\u2019s comments on his social platform X, including a post telling former YouTube CEO Chad Hurley, \u201cIf you touch my wiener, you can have a horse\u201d. \u201cSpaceX management knowingly permitted and fostered a work environment rife with sexual harassment,\u201d Anne B Shaver, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cTo have been terminated for protesting SpaceX\u2019s utter failure to take basic measures to prevent sexual harassment is patently retaliatory, wrong, and actionable.\u201d Paige Holland-Thielen, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement released by her lawyers that the suit was an \u201cimportant milestone in our quest for justice\u201d. \u201cWe hope that this lawsuit encourages our colleagues to stay strong and to keep fighting for a better workplace,\u201d she said. The former employees are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and an order prohibiting SpaceX from continuing to engage in unlawful conduct. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former employees earlier filed a case with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing the company of violating US labour law. The NLRB last month told a federal judge in Texas that it would suspend its case against SpaceX in order to expedite a final ruling in a lawsuit by the company that claims the agency\u2019s structure and procedures violate the US Constitution.

From a father-of-two who planned to leave his job to a 29-year-old due to visit his family in August, two dozen Indians from the southern state of Kerala died in a fire that\u00a0ripped through a labour-housing facility in Kuwait, leaving their families bereft. India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday said 40 Indians died in the blaze at a building housing workers in Kuwait\u2019s Mangaf city, which also killed at least nine others, including three Philippine nationals. Kuwait\u2019s Foreign Minister Abdullah al-Yahya told reporters on Thursday that one person succumbed to injuries, taking the number of deaths to at least 50. More than 50 other workers were injured, some critically, but their nationalities could not immediately be confirmed by the Kuwaiti government.      Most of oil-rich Kuwait\u2019s four million-plus population is made up of foreigners, many of them from South and Southeast Asia working in construction and service industries. They often live in overcrowded accommodations. For decades, a disproportionately large share of Indian workers in the Gulf have been drawn from Kerala, a densely populated state along southern India\u2019s Arabian Sea coast. In Kerala, Norka Roots, a government agency for the state residents living outside, placed the number of dead from the state at 24. The federal government arranged a special flight to bring the bodies, Norka secretary K Vasuki said. In a post on X late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country was \u201cdoing everything possible to assist those affected by this gruesome fire tragedy\u201d. Next of kin will receive payments of 200,000 rupees ($2,400), his office announced. Kirti Vardhan Singh, India\u2019s junior foreign minister, reached Kuwait on an Indian Air Force plane to help survivors and repatriate remains. \u201cSome of the bodies have been charred beyond recognition, so DNA tests [are] under way to identify the victims,\u201d he told Indian media. News of the disaster spread quickly in Kerala. Among the victims from the state was Muralidharan Nair, who had been working in Kuwait for 32 years, including 10 as a senior supervisor in the company that owned the housing facility where the fire broke out. \u201cHe came on leave in December for two months with a plan to end his career in Kuwait. The company called him back,\u201d his brother, Vinu V Nair, told the Reuters news agency, adding that the family identified the 61-year-old from a list of names published by India\u2019s embassy. His two roommates also died in the blaze. The family of Saju Varghese, 56, found out about the fire from television and social media and confirmed his death from friends and relatives in Kuwait. Working in the Gulf nation for the last 21 years, Varghese planned to visit Kerala later this month to arrange his daughter\u2019s higher education. \u201cThe family is in a state of shock,\u201d their neighbour, George Samuel, said. Another victim, Stephin Abraham Sabu, 29, who worked as an engineer in Kuwait since 2019, called home almost daily. He had visited his hometown Kottayam \u201ctwo or three times\u201d since he left, and had booked air tickets to return in August for the housewarming of his family\u2019s new home and to help them buy a new car, his friends said. Sabu\u2019s father has a small shop in Kottayam while his mother is a housewife. His brother, Febin, also works in Kuwait but lives separately. Authorities in Kuwait have not officially announced the nationalities of those who died. But the other dead included three Filipino workers, Leo Cacdac, the Philippine migrant workers minister, said in a statement on Thursday. Two other Filipinos were hospitalised and in critical condition. Kuwaiti officials have detained the building\u2019s owner over potential negligence and have warned that any blocks that flout safety rules will be closed. The blaze was one of the worst seen in Kuwait, which borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and sits on about 7 percent of the world\u2019s known oil reserves. In 2009, 57 people died when a Kuwaiti woman, apparently seeking revenge, set fire to a tent at a wedding party when her husband married a second wife.

Speaking at the Africa CEO Forum in Kigali, Rwanda, on May 17, Africa\u2019s richest person, Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote, complained that he faces far more obstacles travelling around Africa than Europeans ever do. \u201cI have to apply for 35 different visas on my passport [to travel freely across Africa],\u201d Dangote said. \u201cI can assure you that Patrick [Pouyanne, CEO of Total Energies] doesn\u2019t need 35 visas on a French passport, which means [he has] freer movement than myself in Africa.\u201d Even for an uber-wealthy businessman with near unlimited means like Dangote, the continent\u2019s fragmented and discriminatory visa regime is clearly a considerable inconvenience. For millions of African migrants, however, it is a major obstacle to safety, stability, success and prosperity. Indeed, stringent visa regimes discriminating against Africans are not only inconveniencing industrialists and harming the continent\u2019s economic development, but also destroying migrant lives and dreams and hindering efforts to achieve true African unity. Today, while most Westerners are free to roam the continent and exploit its socioeconomic potential with ease, Africans who want to move, for whatever reason, are swimming against the current. This was not always the case. In the 1990s, my father ran a modest butchery and liquor store on Cameron Street, a busy road that stretched from the outskirts of the central business district to the less-endowed environs of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital Harare. Small and nondescript, the shop was surrounded by many thriving businesses that sold cheap furniture, beds, clothes, bags, blankets, and shoes. It catered mainly to revellers and shoppers who lived in the nearby Mbare township, a low-income neighbourhood, as well as workers who commuted from places such as Chitungwiza and outlying rural areas. Among our regular patrons were Mozambican traders who sold cheap watches across the city and kept their stock at our shop. In those years, an ever-increasing number of young entrepreneurs from Central and West Africa were opening up small shops across Harare. These young traders sold distinct, never-before-seen-in-Harare goods imported from India, China, and the UAE: radios, watches, bracelets, chains, and appliances. I frequented these new places on occasion to buy a trinket or two whenever I had money, or simply to have a look at the latest mini gadgets to hit the market. Back then, the increasing diversity of the high street did not bother or alarm many, because it was the norm. When I was a student at the Prince Edward High School in Harare, I had teachers from across the continent. My history teacher, for example, was a calm and strict gentleman from Ghana, Mr Ayisa, who spoke with a fascinating Ghanaian accent. Ms Khosi and Mr Lowe, our mathematics and science teachers, respectively, were South Africans. Prince Edward also had students from as far afield as Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana, South Africa, and Tanzania, to name a few. One Prine Edward pupil from my era, Menzi Simelane, went on to serve as South Africa\u2019s national director of public prosecutions. The school cultivated a vibrant pan-African community. This sentiment of unity was supported by the many reminders of our collective colonial past and interconnected struggles for liberation. Even the streets we walked were named after leading freedom fighters from across Africa, Kwame Nkrumah, Nelson Mandela, Kenneth Kaunda, Julius Nyerere, and Samora Machel. Back then, Harare was a diverse, welcoming city buzzing with potential. It seemed as if we were truly moving towards achieving the unity and collective advancement African leaders envisaged when they established the\u00a0Organisation of African Unity, the predecessor of the African Union (AU), in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in May 1963. Things have changed significantly since those days of my youth. Zimbabwe, like most other African nations, decided to turn its back on the dream of African unity and went on to legislate Afrophobia. In a move that completely destroyed the goodwill which had seen Harare blossom into a welcoming destination for resourceful and hard-working migrants from across Africa, in 2013 the government of Zimbabwe threatened to close foreign-owned shops operating in sectors it had previously earmarked for locals. Then, in March 2018, the Zimbabwe government officially amended the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act to restrict ownership of businesses in 12 reserved sectors to \u201ccitizens of Zimbabwe\u201d. Those sectors are \u2013 public transport (buses, taxis and car hire services); retail and wholesale trade; barber shops, hairdressing and beauty salons; employment agencies; real estate agencies; valet services; grain milling; bakeries; tobacco grading and packaging; advertising agencies; provision of local arts and crafts and their marketing and distribution; and artisanal mining. Last October, Sithembiso Nyoni, the minister of industry and commerce, warned that foreign nationals running tuckshops or wholesale businesses without permits risk arrest. Migrants from countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, Mozambique and Zambia run most of the tuckshops, or \u201ccanteens\u201d, in Zimbabwe. The government has also launched many large-scale crackdowns on undocumented African migrants in recent times, further signalling their determination to ensure Zimbabwe is not a destination for everyday Africans looking for a better life. In 2013, I was shocked by the Zimbabwean government\u2019s move to outlaw and attempt to close down businesses owned by African migrants. I thought it was a deplorable renunciation of African unity that was largely unique on the continent. But I was wrong. In no time, this Afrophobic malaise has spread like wildfire in the region. Botswana promulgated the Industrial Development Act of 2019 and its Regulations of 2020 to reserve certain sectors for its citizens only. In 2020, the provincial government of Gauteng, South Africa\u2019s richest province, attempted to ban foreigners from opening businesses in townships. There is also widespread displeasure with Ethiopian and Somali migrants running spazas, small informal grocery shops operated from residential premises in townships, in these countries. Meanwhile, authorities in Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, Malawi, Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya have cracked down on undocumented migrants. And last July, Black African foreigners in Tunisia were targets of organised racist assaults by Tunisians instigated by President Kais Saied. He falsely accused Black Africans of trying to alter his country\u2019s demographic makeup through extensive immigration. A new brand of hardline anti-immigration politics has swept through Africa that threatens to asphyxiate the AU\u2019s noble quest to eventually establish freedom of movement, work, and residence. So, the timely observations made by Dangote and the adverse experiences of migrants across the continent speak to the systemic failings crippling the African dream. At school, I, along with thousands of others, was most privileged to experience the sweet zenith of African expertise and friendship. For years, in downtown Harare, I witnessed how largely underprivileged communities lived and worked with so-called foreigners. I befriended migrants of all backgrounds, everyday Africans who were smart, dedicated and savvy businesspeople in their own right. They did not steal market share from Zimbabweans in their business dealings. Instead, they brought with them new commercial practices, improved the marketplace, and seamlessly integrated into society. As Dangote advised African political and business leaders in Kigali, Africa is a sorely divided and challenging place to manoeuvre. Spurred by the divisive antics of neo-fascist politicians, amid socioeconomic tribulations, Africans are increasingly looking inwards and othering their fellow\u00a0 Africans. In January 2018, the AU adopted the Free Movement of Persons (FMP) Protocol. It calls for member states to give the nationals of other member states the right to visa-free entry into their territory, right of residence, and right to establish a business. As of August 2023, however, only 33 of the 55 member states had signed the FMP Protocol, and just four \u2013 Mali, Rwanda, Niger, and Sao Tome and Principe \u2013 had ratified it. Africa needs to do better to defeat the scourge of Afrophobia and bring unity back to the continent. Freedom of movement is essential to creating a single market and boosting economic outcomes across the continent. It would also provide security and stability to the millions of Africans who have found homes and set up businesses outside of their countries of birth. As proven by the European Union, the freedom of movement is an economic game changer. Politicians and citizens alike must view Dangote\u2019s statement as a wake-up call. Do not close shops. Rather, open more. All Africans must be afforded an opportunity to exploit Africa\u2019s immense socioeconomic potential.

The European Union\u2019s top court has slapped Hungary with a 200-million-euro ($216m) fine and imposed a daily one-million-euro ($1.08m) penalty for failing to follow the bloc\u2019s asylum laws and for illegally deporting migrants. Hungary\u2019s anti-immigrant government has taken a hard line on people entering the country since well over one million refugees and asylum seekers entered Europe in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria. It erected border fences and forcefully tried to stop many from entering. In its verdict issued on Thursday, the European Court of Justice said Hungary had failed to take measures \u201cto comply with the 2020 judgment as regards the right of applicants for international protection to remain in Hungary pending a final decision on their appeal against the rejection of their application and the removal of illegally staying third-country nationals\u201d. \u201cThat failure, which consists in deliberately avoiding the application of a common EU policy as a whole, constitutes an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law,\u201d Thursday\u2019s ECJ verdict added. A Hungarian government spokesman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the ECJ ruling. The government has previously argued that the 2020 ruling was moot as it had already closed so-called \u201ctransit zones\u201d while also hardening rules to bar future asylum applicants.      Under current Hungarian legislation, people can only submit requests for asylum outside of the country\u2019s borders, at its embassies in neighbouring Serbia or Ukraine. Those who try to cross the border are routinely pushed back. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has often clashed with Brussels on issues ranging from the independence of the judiciary to sending arms to Ukraine, promised in 2021 to \u201cmaintain the existing regime (regarding asylum seekers) even if the European court ordered us to change it\u201d. The European Commission filed a second application before the court in early 2022, saying Hungary has not taken all the necessary measures to comply with the panel\u2019s 2020 judgement. The EU rules oblige all member countries to have common procedures for granting asylum. Under EU rules, people have the right to apply for asylum or other forms of international protection if they fear for their safety in their home countries or face the prospect of persecution based on their race, religion, ethnic background, gender or other discrimination.

Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a small watercraft and missile attack that left a Greek-owned cargo ship taking water and in need of rescue near the Red Sea port of Hodeidah. There were no immediate reports of casualties in Wednesday\u2019s attack on the cargo ship. It is unclear if the vessel\u2019s ownership has any connection to Israel. The Iran-backed group, which is at war with a Saudi Arabia-led coalition, has been in control of Yemen\u2019s capital Sanaa and its most populous areas. It has been launching scores of drone and missile attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November in support of the Palestinians under Israeli attack in Gaza. They have sunk one ship, seized another vessel, and killed three seafarers in several attacks.      The Houthis said the Tutor coal carrier was seriously damaged and vulnerable to sinking after they targeted the vessel with an unmanned surface boat, drones and ballistic missiles. The ship was hit about 68 nautical miles (126km) southwest of Hodeidah, maritime security firm Ambrey said on Wednesday. \u201cThe impact of the [unmanned surface vessel] caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room,\u201d the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on the attack, which was the Houthis\u2019 first using a boat as a weapon. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which acts as a conduit between ship operators and military and security forces, said on Wednesday the Liberian-flagged Tutor was taking on water and not under the crew\u2019s command after sustaining damage to its engine room. UKMTO said a small craft of white colour collided with the cargo ship\u2019s stern and that an \u201cunknown airborne projectile\u201d also struck the vessel. \u201cIt was hit twice by air and by sea. There are no reports of injuries,\u201d a Greek official said on condition of anonymity. The Tutor was sailing to India when it was hit, they said. The Tutor loaded at the Port of Ust-Luga, Russia, on May 18 and discharged at Port Said, Egypt, on June 9, according to the London Stock Exchange Group\u00a0data. Its next scheduled destination was Aqaba, Jordan, according to it. The Houthi attacks have upended global trade by forcing ship owners to reroute vessels away from the vital Suez Canal shortcut, drawing retaliatory strikes from the United States and the UK since February. On Wednesday, the Houthis said they also carried out two joint military operations with Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iran-backed armed group, targeting sites in Israel\u2019s cities of Ashdod and Haifa. The latter confirmed the operations. The Houthi attacks continue while negotiators from the US, Egypt and Qatar attempt to mediate a ceasefire in the Gaza war, which began after Hamas killed more than 1,200 people and took about 250 others captive in the October 7 attacks on Israel. Israel responded with an air, ground and sea assault on the Palestinian territory that has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.

Rwanda has accused the United Nations refugee agency of lying after the body told a British court this week that asylum seekers sent to the East African country could be moved on to states where they risked torture or death. The British plan to deport refugees to Rwanda has been mired in legal challenges. But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has insisted it will proceed if his Conservative Party wins a July 4 general election. Lawyers representing the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Monday said Rwanda\u2019s asylum system was inadequate, as part of a challenge to the British government\u2019s policy to deport asylum seekers there. The lawyers said the policy risked asylum seekers facing a banned process known as refoulement, building on past evidence that formed an important part of the British Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning when it ruled the British plan unlawful last year. \u201cUNHCR is lying,\u201d the Rwandan government said in a statement on Wednesday, accusing the agency of making \u201ca series of wholly unserious allegations\u201d against Kigali. \u201cThe organisation seems intent on presenting fabricated allegations to UK courts about\u00a0Rwanda\u2019s treatment of asylum seekers, while still partnering with us to bring African migrants from Libya to safety in\u00a0Rwanda.\u201d Monday\u2019s hearing in the United Kingdom \u2013 where the UNHCR made a successful bid to intervene \u2013 is the latest in a string of legal challenges dogging the initiative.      It follows an earlier legal challenge brought by the FDA trade union representing civil servants, which was heard on June 6, with the verdict still pending. The UN agency said it had always raised concerns about the risks refugees were exposed to from \u201cexternalisation\u201d, including refoulement. \u201cUNHCR \u2026 finds that the UK-Rwanda\u00a0Asylum partnership shifts responsibility for making asylum decisions and for protecting refugees,\u201d it said in a statement on Wednesday. Rwanda\u2019s government said cases raised by the UNHCR lawyers in court had involved both the arrivals of those with legal status in other countries who fell short of its entry requirements, and people leaving voluntarily. Britain\u2019s ruling Conservatives say the deportation scheme is designed to deter migrants from attempting to cross the English Channel to the UK from northern France. Sunak has said it will proceed if his party wins the July 4 election. However, opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer has promised to ditch the plan if his party wins the July 4 election.

G7 nations have agreed upon a $50bn deal to fund Ukraine through profits on frozen Russian assets, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said. \u201cI confirm to you that we have reached political agreement to provide additional financial support to Ukraine of approximately $50bn by the end of the year,\u201d Meloni, who is hosting the G7 this year, said on Thursday. Meloni had invited President Volodymr Zelenskyy to join a special summit session on the Ukraine war with US President Joe Biden and the leaders of France, Germany, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. Addressing the meeting at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort, Zelenskyy thanked the leaders for their support, which he said would go towards \u201cboth defence and reconstruction\u201d, though he emphasised the need for more weapons. The G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multiyear loan using profits from some $300bn of impounded Russian funds.

It is the windfall profits from the Russian immobilised assets in Europe that will serve it,\u201d von der Leyen told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 summit in southern Italy. \u201cThe finance ministers are now going through the details \u2013 for example, the topic of backstops that are necessary \u2013 and [will] clarify this as soon as possible.\u201d      Germany\u2019s Finance Minister Christian Lindner hailed \u201cunity\u201d following the agreement. \u201cGood news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine,\u201d he wrote on X. The deal on Ukraine\u2019s loan agreed upon at the three-day summit, where leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies are convening, marks \u201ca very historic step and a historic decision,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday. \u201cThe next step will be just to create the technical conditions for implementation in the shortest possible time,\u201d Scholz said. Scholz added that G7 leaders are sending a clear message to Russian President Vladimir Putin and demonstrating their unity and determination. \u201cThe Russian president has a very obvious plan: he wants to push ahead with his war until everyone else gives up supporting Ukraine. This plan has failed today,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cWith the G7 states\u2019 plan to mobilise $50bn, which will be financed from the windfall profits of the frozen Russian assets, the foundation has been laid for Ukraine to be able to procure everything it needs in the near future, not only in terms of weapons, but also for reconstruction or energy infrastructure.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said that finance ministers would now work on the details of the agreement. Reporting from Moscow, Yulia Shapovalova said Russian Foreign Ministry representative Maria Zakharova said using those profits would be \u201cextremely painful for Brussels\u201d, as Russia owns significant European property and funds. \u201cSo Europe will first have to pay for all its madness out of its own wallet,\u201d said Zakharova. Earlier, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said actions against Russian assets in the West would receive a \u201creciprocal response\u201d because in Russia essentially the same amount of Western funds have been frozen. He noted recently Russia has \u201cincome\u201d from those assets. Also on Thursday, US President Joe Biden and Zelenskyy signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement aimed at bolstering Ukraine\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s invasion. The agreement, signed on the sidelines of the summit, is meant to be a step towards Ukraine\u2019s eventual NATO membership, according to the text of the deal. \u201cThe parties recognise this agreement as supporting a bridge to Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership in the NATO alliance,\u201d the text says. Zelenskyy has long sought NATO membership but the allies have stopped short of taking that step. The Western alliance regards any attack launched on one of its 32 members as an attack on all under its Article Five clause. In the event of an armed attack or threat of such against Ukraine, top US and Ukrainian officials will meet within 24 hours to consult on a response and determine what additional defence needs are required for Ukraine, the agreement says. Under the agreement, the United States restates its support for Ukraine\u2019s defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, amid a renewed push by Russia on Ukraine\u2019s eastern front. \u201cTo ensure Ukraine\u2019s security, both sides recognise Ukraine needs a significant military force, robust capabilities, and sustained investments in its defense industrial base that are consistent with North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] standards,\u201d the text says. \u201cThe United States intends to provide long-term materiel, training and advising, sustainment, intelligence, security, defense industrial, institutional, and other support to develop Ukrainian security and defense forces that are capable of defending a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine and deterring future aggression,\u201d it says. The summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil. Apart from the conflict in Ukraine, Israel\u2019s continuing assault in Gaza is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries. Many G7 countries are also in political flux, with summit attendees aware this could be Biden\u2019s last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November\u2019s elections. The UK\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be toppled in July 4 elections, while France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU Parliament elections last weekend. By contrast, Italy\u2019s Meloni is riding high after her far-right party came out on top in her country\u2019s EU Parliament vote. The summit talks began with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East. G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of captives taken in Hamas\u2019s October 7 attack on southern Israel. Meanwhile, Biden said he has not lost hope of getting an agreement on a Gaza ceasefire, but called on the Palestinian Hamas group to step up. Biden, asked if he was confident there would be a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel soon, said, \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t lost hope, but it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cHamas has to move.\u201d Mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt have tried for months to broker a ceasefire amid Israel\u2019s deadly assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 37,200 Palestinians and devastated the heavily populated enclave.

Hundreds of thousands of people are trapped in el-Fasher \u2013 the last large urban centre in the vast, western Darfur region not under RSF control. The UNSC measure called for de-escalation around el-Fasher and for \u201cthe withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians\u201d. It called on the RSF and military \u201cto seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue\u201d. It also called on all nations to end interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts. \u201cCrucial roads out of el-Fasher are blocked, preventing civilians from reaching safer areas, while at the same time limiting the amount of food and other humanitarian aid coming into the city,\u201d said Othman Belbeisi, the International Organization for Migration regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, welcomed the resolution on Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s resolution puts the Sudanese Armed Forces & Rapid Support Forces on notice that the world is watching,\u201d Charbonneau wrote in a social media post. \u201cIt warns of imminent famine, especially in Darfur, & calls for accountability for violations of int\u2019l humanitarian & human rights law.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court\u2019s (ICC) chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, appealed for evidence for an investigation by his office into alleged war crimes in Darfur. \u201cI am extremely concerned about allegations of widespread international crimes being committed in el-Fasher and its surrounding areas,\u201d Khan said in a video statement on Tuesday. He added that the probe \u201cseems to disclose an organised, systematic and a profound attack on human dignity\u201d.      In 2009, the ICC issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges including genocide allegedly committed in Darfur between 2003-2008. The RSF was born out of the Popular Defence Forces militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilised by al-Bashir against non-Arab tribes in Darfur. The Sudanese military removed al-Bashir from power in 2019 after months of antigovernment protests. A promised transition to full civilian rule in the post-Bashir era did not materialise, and the Sudanese military staged a coup against the civilian government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in October 2021, leading to his resignation early in 2022. Weeks before violence between the military and RSF erupted last year, Sudan\u2019s leaders appeared set to sign a deal to return the country to its democratic transition, but the accord was delayed because of outstanding disagreements.

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States military launched a secret campaign to counter what it perceived as China\u2019s growing influence in the Philippines, a nation hit especially hard by the deadly virus, an investigation by the Reuters news agency has found. Through phony internet accounts meant to impersonate Filipinos, the military\u2019s propaganda efforts morphed into an anti-vaccination campaign, Reuters reported in a story released on Friday. Social media posts decried the quality of face masks, test kits and the first vaccine that would become available in the Philippines \u2013 China\u2019s Sinovac inoculation. The clandestine operation has not been previously reported. It aimed to sow doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccines and other life-saving aid that was being supplied by China, the Reuters investigation found. It identified at least 300 accounts on X, formerly Twitter, that matched descriptions shared by former US military officials familiar with the operation. Almost all were created in the middle of 2020 and centred on the slogan #Chinaangvirus \u2013 Tagalog for \u201cChina is the virus.\u201d \u201cCOVID came from China and the VACCINE also came from China, don\u2019t trust China!\u201d one typical tweet from July 2020 read. The words were posted next to a photo of a syringe beside a Chinese flag and a soaring chart of infections. Another post read: \u201cFrom China \u2013 PPE, Face Mask, Vaccine: FAKE. But the Coronavirus is real.\u201d After Reuters asked X about the accounts, the social media company removed the profiles, determining they were part of a coordinated bot campaign based on activity patterns and internal data. The US military\u2019s anti-vax effort began in the spring of 2020 and expanded beyond Southeast Asia before it was terminated in mid-2021. The Pentagon tailored the campaign to local audiences across Central Asia and the Middle East using a combination of fake social media accounts on multiple platforms to spread fear of China\u2019s vaccines among Muslims at a time when the virus was killing tens of thousands of people each day. A key part of the strategy: amplify the disputed contention that, because vaccines sometimes contain pork gelatin, China\u2019s shots could be considered forbidden under Islamic law. The military programme started under former President Donald Trump and continued months into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 even after alarmed social media executives warned the new administration that the Pentagon had been trafficking in COVID misinformation, Reuters said. The Biden White House issued an edict in spring 2021 banning the anti-vax effort, which also disparaged vaccines produced by other rivals, and the Pentagon initiated an internal review. Spokespeople for Trump and Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the clandestine programme, Reuters reported. A senior Department of Defense official acknowledged the US military engaged in secret propaganda to disparage China\u2019s vaccine in the developing world, but the unnamed official declined to provide details. A Pentagon spokeswoman said the US military \u201cuses a variety of platforms, including social media, to counter those malign influence attacks aimed at the US, allies and partners\u201d. She alleged China started a \u201cdisinformation campaign to falsely blame the United States for the spread of COVID-19\u201d. In an email, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it has long maintained the US government manipulates social media and spreads misinformation. A spokesperson for the Philippines Department of Health said the \u201cfindings by Reuters deserve to be investigated and heard by the appropriate authorities of the involved countries\u201d. Some American public health experts condemned the Pentagon programme, saying it put civilians in jeopardy for potential geopolitical gain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s defensible,\u201d said Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth College\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine. \u201cI\u2019m extremely dismayed, disappointed and disillusioned to hear that the US government would do that.\u201d The effort to stoke fear about Chinese inoculations risked undermining overall public trust in government health initiatives, including US-made vaccines that became available later, Lucey and others said. Although the Chinese vaccines were found to be less effective than the American-led shots by Pfizer and Moderna, all were approved by the World Health Organization. Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cIt should have been in our interest to get as much vaccine in people\u2019s arms as possible,\u201d said Greg Treverton, former chairman of the US National Intelligence Council, which coordinates the analysis and strategy of Washington\u2019s many spy agencies. What the Pentagon did, Treverton said, \u201ccrosses a line\u201d.

Russian prosecutors have said US journalist Evan Gershkovich will face trial in the Ural city of Yekaterinburg, where he was detained more than a year ago after he was accused of working for the CIA. Gershkovich, 32, is accused of \u201cgathering secret information\u201d on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility that produces and repairs military equipment, the prosecutor general\u2019s office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against him. The statement gave no date for the trial. Gershkovich, a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, has been in jail since he was arrested in Yekaterinburg, about 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) east of Moscow, on March 29, 2023, and was accused of spying. He denies any wrongdoing. Following the Russian announcement, the Journal said that Gershkovich was facing \u201ca false and baseless charge\u201d. A joint statement from Almar Latour, the newspaper\u2019s publisher, and its editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, demanded Gershkovich\u2019s immediate release. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous,\u201d the statement said. \u201cEvan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies.\u201d The United States designated Gershkovich \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d in April 2023, and President Joe Biden has called his detention \u201ctotally illegal\u201d. Latour and Tucker said they now expected the US government to step up efforts to secure his release. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington would continue to work to bring Gershkovich home. \u201cEvan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe charges against him are false. And the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately.\u201d Gershkovich was the first US journalist to be arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War, as Moscow enacted increasingly\u00a0repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine. Washington has sought to negotiate his release, but Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Moscow would consider a prisoner swap only after a verdict in his trial. Asked last week by The Associated Press news agency about Gershkovich, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the US was \u201ctaking energetic steps\u201d to secure the journalist\u2019s release. He told international news agencies in a rare news conference that any such releases \u201caren\u2019t decided via mass media\u201d but through a \u201cdiscreet, calm and professional approach\u201d. \u201cAnd they certainly should be decided only on the basis of reciprocity,\u201d he added, alluding to a potential prisoner swap. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The Uralvagonzavod factory, about 100km (60 miles) north of Yekaterinburg, has been sanctioned by Western countries. Based in the city of Nizhny Tagil in the Sverdlovsk region, it plays a crucial role in supplying tanks for Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence. The factory, which is run by a state conglomerate controlled by one of Putin\u2019s allies, has publicly spoken of producing T-90M battle tanks and modernising T-72B3M tanks. The number of tanks which Russia has lost in battle in Ukraine is a military secret in Russia, which says it has\u00a0ramped up\u00a0tank production. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank said in February\u00a0that Russia had lost more than 3,000 tanks \u2013 the equivalent of its entire pre-war active inventory \u2013 but had enough lower-quality armoured vehicles in storage for years of replacements.

Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a major attack on el-Fasher in North Darfur a day after the UN Security Council demanded the militia halt its weeks-long siege of the city. Sudan\u2019s Armed Forces \u201caborted the attack and inflicted huge losses\u201d with \u201chundreds\u201d of dead and wounded in the failed RSF assault, it said in a statement. Among those killed was a senior RSF commander, Ali Yagoub Gibril, and the attackers \u201cfled from the battlefield\u201d, it added. No response from RSF was immediately available. The conflict in Sudan broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the\u00a0RSF, which is loyal to General Mohamed Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo. The violence has killed at least\u00a014,000 people and displaced more than 10 million others, according to UN estimates. The UN and human rights groups have said they fear ethnic cleansing if RSF captures el-Fasher, a city of 1.8 million people and the last army stronghold in the Darfur region. The war has created the worst humanitarian situation in the world, with an estimated 756,000 people in Sudan facing \u201ccatastrophic food shortages\u201d by September.  Many Sudanese have joined the armed forces to fight back against the rampaging RSF. Musa Adam was displaced from his city of Nyala in South Darfur. He told Al Jazeera the horrors committed by RSF soldiers made him join the SAF effort against the militia. \u201cThe displacement, the looting of civilians, the rape of our sisters and mothers is what made me join. The RSF took over Nyala and staying there became too dangerous. So I came here but joined to return to Darfur and fight the RSF.\u201d In North Darfur, RSF launched repeated attacks that led to the displacement of more than 130,000 people in the past month. Several mass graves have been reported in the state. Dozens of villages have been burned to the ground, mostly of ethnic Zaghawas. Abu-Alqassim Mohammed, a former RSF officer, also joined the Sudanese Armed Forces. \u201cI reported to the army on the first day of the conflict against the RSF because it rebelled against the government. They stood against the army and against the country from day one. They killed civilians and forced them from their homes,\u201d he said. El-Fasher has become a focal point of the nearly yearlong war. The battle for the city \u2013 seen as crucial for humanitarian aid in a region on the brink of famine \u2013 has raged for more than a month. The charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said on Friday fighting in el-Fasher has killed at least 226 people and wounded 1,418. The overall death toll is believed to be far higher with the wounded unable to get treatment amid continuing air raids, shelling and ground combat. \u201cThe situation in el-Fasher is chaotic,\u201d said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, head of MSF\u2019s emergency programme.      The UN Security Council\u2019s latest resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, and compliance with an arms embargo on Sudan, following a previous unsuccessful ceasefire call in March coinciding with Ramadan. The United States on Friday announced $315m in emergency aid for Sudan warning a famine of historic proportions could be unfolding. \u201cWe need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,\u201d Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen mortality projections estimating that in excess of 2.5 million people \u2013 about 15 percent of the population \u2013 in Darfur and Kordofan, the hardest-hit regions, could die by the end of September,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the largest humanitarian crisis on the face of the planet, and yet somehow it threatens to get worse as the rainy season approaches.\u201d               Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":null,"title":"Families receive bodies of Indian workers killed in Kuwait apartment fire","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/program\/newsfeed\/2024\/6\/14\/families-receive-bodies-of-indian-workers-killed-in-kuwait-apartment-fire","description":"The Indian government repatriated the bodies of 45 migrant workers who were killed in a massive apartment building fire.","date":"2024-06-14T17:23:49Z","content":"The Indian government repatriated the bodies of 45 migrant workers who were killed in a massive apartment building fire in Kuwait.

South Korean and United States officials have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea, which could take place this month and deepen military ties, would be a breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions. According to Seoul\u2019s foreign ministry on Friday, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong-kyun said in an emergency phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell that Putin\u2019s visit should not result in more military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. \u201cWhile closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight cooperation to North Korea\u2019s provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Campbell also pledged continued cooperation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the visit. Rumours about the trip began on Monday after Russia\u2019s Vedomosti newspaper reported that Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to give a date for the possible visit. \u201cWe have the right to develop good relations with our neighbours and this should not cause concern for anyone,\u201d Peskov said. He added North Korea was a \u201cfriendly country for us, with whom we are developing bilateral relations\u201d. \u201cWe will do that further. The potential for development in our relations is very deep\u201d. The US has claimed that during Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, North Korean-made missiles and artillery shells have been used to attack Ukraine. While Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the claims, the two leaders met in eastern Russia last September and agreed to deepen cooperation, including military relations. On Wednesday, Campbell said the US has a good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, adding that it has had \u201ca substantial impact on the battlefield\u201d. But what\u2019s less clear, he said, was what Russia had given its counterpart. \u201cHard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We don\u2019t know. But we\u2019re concerned by that and watching carefully,\u201d he said. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said due to the war on Ukraine, Russia had been forced to grant \u201clong-sought concessions\u201d to North\u00a0Korea, China and Iran \u201cwith the potential to undermine, among other things, long-held non-proliferation norms\u201d. While Haines did not elaborate on her statement, the reference to non-proliferation norms was a potential warning that Russia could provide North Korea with military-related technology. Kim has been leading the modernisation of North Korea\u2019s military arsenal, with the country testing an array of weaponry and last November putting its first military spy satellite into orbit.

Brazil used to be home to at least 1,000 Indigenous tribes, an estimated 13 million people, before the arrival of European colonisers. Today, there are only about 300 communities left. Many of them feel discriminated against and under pressure to assimilate into urban culture, something influencers are fighting by making diverse Indigenous identities visible online.

Less than a year after their crowning glory at the Euros, the Azzurri encountered the ignominy of missing out on the 2022 Qatar World Cup after a stunning stoppage time goal saw them lose their playoff semifinal to football minnows North Macedonia. Their qualification campaign for Euro 2024 was similarly fraught. After their first two qualifiers \u2013 a loss to England and a win over Malta \u2013 Italy were rocked by the resignation of manager Roberto Mancini after more than five years in the job. He was replaced by Luciano Spalletti, whose first game in charge was a 1-1 draw, which also happened to be against their 2022 nemesis, North Macedonia. With only one victory in their first three games, Euro 2024 qualification suddenly looked precarious. A run of three wins in four matches saw Italy go into the final group game against Ukraine, knowing a loss would see them enter the playoffs. A tense goalless draw secured direct passage to the Euros owing to their superior head-to-head record. To go along with their qualification woes, the Italian side\u2019s preparations were rocked by a betting scandal that saw the police visit the national team\u2019s Coverciano training centre ahead of their qualifiers in October to question Sandro Tonali and Nicolo Zaniolo. The duo subsequently left the camp and Tonali was later handed a 10-month ban by the Italian Football Federation. Juventus midfielder Nicolo Fagioli was also handed a seven-month ban after being found guilty in the investigation, but he was named in Italy\u2019s final 26-man squad for Euro 2024. His inclusion is indicative of the dearth of attacking options in front of Spalletti. Zaniolo and forward Domenico Berardi were ruled out of the tournament through injury, while Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Insigne no longer play their club football in Europe and have faded from national favour. Injuries have hindered Federico Chiesa\u2019s progress, with the 26-year-old Juventus forward yet to recapture the form that saw him light up Euro 2020. Gianluca Scamacca, who scored 19 goals for Europa League winners Atalanta this season, is expected to lead the front line but he has scored just once for Italy in his 15 appearances. Giacomo Raspadori is the other striking option at Spalletti\u2019s disposal, but he has managed only 12 goals across the last two seasons. All this points to a side that will be built around its defence. Unsurprisingly, Azzurri are not lacking for talent in this department \u2013 their 30-man preliminary squad features 11 eleven defenders. Of these 11, four were from Inter Milan \u2013 prior to Francesco Acerbi\u2019s late injury withdrawal \u2013 and given the Nerazzurri\u2019s parsimonious defence this year, the remaining three Inter defenders are all likely to start in Germany. The 22 goals Inter conceded in the Serie A this season are the lowest among all clubs in Europe\u2019s top five leagues. The feat was achieved playing a back-three. So, replicating a system with a group of defenders already comfortable playing in it feels an almost no-brainer for Spalletti\u2019s national team at Euro 2024. The manager fielded a three-man defence for the first time in his tenure in the March 2024 friendlies against Venezuela and Ecuador, with Italy going on to win both. The sample size is small but the ceiling could be high. A backline comprising of Alessandro Bastoni and Alessandro Boungiorni \u2013 the likely Acerbi replacement \u2013 with Federico Dimarco and Matteo Darmian at wing-back is, on paper, one of the best defences at Euro 2024. But will that be enough to take them deep in the tournament? Spalletti admitted in an interview with Sky Italia that there are other countries that are at a higher level than Italy but backed his team to compete with them. \u201cOur target is to return from Germany and hear Italians say, \u2018We are proud of you,\u2019\u201d he said. Drawn in a difficult group that includes Spain, Croatia and Albania, even a quarterfinal finish would go a long way towards helping Spalletti meet this objective. If the Italians can pull off an unlikely tournament coup, they will join Germany and Spain as the record three-time European champions.

Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin denounced an agreement by Western countries to provide Ukraine with a loan package using frozen Russian assets and pledged retaliation. Speaking at a meeting on Friday with officials from the foreign ministry, Putin said leaders in the West were trying to come up with \u201csome kind of legal basis\u201d for the asset freezes, \u201cbut despite all the trickery theft is still theft and will not go unpunished\u201d. He added Moscow\u2019s treatment was proof that \u201canyone\u201d could be next and punished by an asset freeze. Putin\u2019s comments came after the Group of Seven (G7) members agreed on an outline deal for a $50bn loan package for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Putin sent his troops into the neighbouring country in February 2022. The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Union also participates in all discussions. Following the announcement at the G7 annual summit in Italy, US President Joe Biden said the frozen assets agreement was a \u201csignificant outcome\u201d and \u201canother reminder to Putin that we\u2019re not backing down\u201d. The details of the agreement are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, and the money is expected to reach Ukraine by the end of the year. However, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the deal on Friday, saying it was \u201cjust pieces of paper\u201d. \u201cThese agreements are about nothing. They do not have legal force,\u201d Zakharova was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying.      Putin also laid out a series of conditions to end the war in Ukraine, including the country dropping its NATO ambitions and the withdrawal of its forces from the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claimed in a referendum the West and Kyiv called \u201cillegal\u201d. \u201cThe conditions are very simple,\u201d the Russian president said ahead a Ukraine peace summit starting on Saturday in Switzerland to be attended by representatives of more than 90 nations and organisations. \u201cAs soon as they declare in Kyiv they are ready for such a decision and begin a real withdrawal of troops from these regions [including Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia], and also officially announce the abandonment of their plans to join NATO \u2013 on our side, immediately, literally at the same minute, an order will follow to cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cI repeat, we will do this immediately. Naturally, we will simultaneously guarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations.\u201d Shortly afterwards, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed Putin\u2019s conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s all a complete sham. Therefore \u2013 once again \u2013 get rid of illusions and stop taking seriously the \u2018proposals of Russia\u2019 that are offensive to common sense,\u201d Podolyak wrote on social media. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry also said Putin\u2019s statement was aimed at \u201cmisleading\u201d the international community. Washington dismissed Putin\u2019s remarks as well. \u201cHe is not in any position to dictate to Ukraine what they must do to bring about peace,\u201d Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Austin also suggested NATO will not accept new members soon despite Ukraine\u2019s push to join the alliance. \u201cI don\u2019t see any desire or indication that we will pursue expansion at any point in the near future.\u201d LIVE: @SecDef Lloyd J. Austin III briefs the media following a meeting of @NATO ministers of defense. https:\/\/t.co\/PQ2dK1Joqf \u2014 Department of Defense \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@DeptofDefense) June 14, 2024  Still, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will play a greater role in coordinating military aid to Ukraine \u2013 an effort currently led by the US. \u201cThese efforts do not make NATO a party to the conflict but they will enhance our support to Ukraine to uphold its right to self-defence,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels. In separate comments, Putin said the world had reached a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d, adding the collapse of the \u201cWestern model\u201d of global security required a new and more stable system in its place. \u201cObviously, we are witnessing the collapse of the Euro-Atlantic security system. Today it simply does not exist, it needs to be essentially created anew,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAll this requires us, together with our partners, with all interested countries, and there are many of them, to work out our own options for ensuring security in Eurasia, proposing them then for wider international discussion.\u201d The Russian president added his country is open to discussing a new security system with everyone, including the US-led NATO military alliance. \u201cIt is important to proceed from the fact the future security architecture is open to all Eurasian countries that wish to take part in its creation. \u2018To all\u2019 means European and NATO countries too, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live on the same continent. No matter what happens, you cannot change the geography. We will have to coexist and work together one way or another.\u201d               Follow Al Jazeera English:"},{"author":"Ted Regencia","title":"Israel\u2019s war on Gaza live: 1 million \u2018exhausted\u2019 people \u2018trapped\u2019 in south","url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/liveblog\/2024\/6\/15\/israels-war-on-gaza-live-1-million-exhausted-people-trapped-in-south","description":"G7 demands open access for the UN Palestinian refugee agency, as UN\u2019s food agency says Israel still blocks aid delivery.","date":"2024-06-15T00:00:08Z","content":"At least 28 killed, dozens wounded in Israeli bombing of three homes in Gaza City.

Edited by Nadia Ragozhina and Emily Atkinson All times stated are UK Emily Atkinson Live reporter That's it from us. It's been a slower Saturday on the campaign trail, but there was still plenty to keep us busy. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning for more, but in the meantime there's plenty on offer across the BBC to keep you going: Today's page was brought to you by Nadia Ragozhina, Ali Abbas Ahmadi and me. It's been a slower than usual Saturday of campaigning as the UK prepares for a general election.  We are about to close this page, so here's a reminder of what's been happening today:  Let's return to the Labour campaign for a moment and hear from the shadow health secretary who's been speaking to the BBC about Labour's plan for the NHS.  During a visit to a hospital in Nottinghamshire earlier, Wes Streeting says that if the NHS continued to function as it has under Rishi Sunak, waiting lists \"could do as high as 10 m\".  For context: Waiting lists in England have fallen from their peak last September, but are still higher than when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to cut them, in January 2023. After falling from a peak of 7.8m in September, the number rose slightly again this week. Streeting says the last Labour government delivered the lowest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction. \"We did it before, and with the country's permission, we can do it again,\" he adds. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue points out that the last Labour government increased spending on the NHS by 7% each year, and asks whether a new Labour government would do the same. Streeting says that the public finances are in \"a real state\" after 14 years of Tory governments, and says that the Labour manifesto is \"a fully costed and fully funded plan\". This\nmorning, Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator magazine, accused the\nConservative Party of thinking it had \"the licence to lie\" over its\ntax attacks on Labour. For context: This was in reference to the Tory campaign's repeated claim that Labour would raise taxes by \u00a32,000 per working household if it formed the next government. BBC Verify has analysed the Conservatives' \u00a32,000 tax claims and concluded that they risked misleading people. Nelson has frequently challenged the Tories' claim on social media about the tax claim. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's strange. [The Conservatives] seem to think they've got a licence to lie during election campaigns. Political adverts aren't regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority, so you can say things there that would get you prosecuted.\" I don't know if they expect tribalism from journalists on the right - but journalists are going to point out untruths when they're seen. Suffice to say it didn't go down very well.\" Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of \"deliberately\" lying about Labour's plans, adding that he would not bring in tax rises for working people. In an interview for ITV's Tonight programme, recorded on Thursday, Rishi Sunak replied \"no\" when asked by presenter Paul Brand if he was \"willing to lie in order to stay in power\". Today, in this podcast recorded live on BBC Radio 4, our Electioncast colleagues look at warnings from Defence Secretary Grant Shapps about a big Labour\nmajority.  Adam Fleming, Laura Kuenssberg and Paddy O\u2019Connell also look at Reform UK - one poll put the party a point ahead of the Tories for the first time.  For context: Polling ahead of the Tories doesn't mean Reform UK is about to get lots of MPs, as our Political Editor Chris Mason explains here. Hannah Miller Political correspondent Asked about the rise of Reform UK earlier today, Veterans' Minister Johnny Mercer\nsays people are fed up of \u201cpoliticians making commitments that are not\nfulfilled in a way that they would like to see\u201d. Labour would point out that it is the Conservatives who have been\nin power for 14 years and not fulfilling some of their commitments. Lack of\ntrust is a problem Keir Starmer has acknowledged, promising to restore faith in\npolitics. But through the campaign Starmer has at times struggled to\nanswer directly uncomfortable questions about tax - constrained by the economic\nrealities he is likely to inherit, and the deluge of negative headlines that\nwould inevitably ensue if he did. Nigel Farage faces no such constraints, having never had to deliver\nin government. His continuing presence on the UK political scene could prove a\nchallenge for all politicians. Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of being \"intent on destroying\" the Conservative Party.  In an interview with the Times, he says: \u201cI want to be as sure as we can that we get no Reform members of parliament and the Conservative Party can move forward.\u201d Asked about comments Farage made to the paper, when he said Rishi Sunak \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand our culture\u201d, Cameron says: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch sheep dog trials to hear a dog whistle.\" Elsewhere, former home secretary Suella Braverman uses a Telegraph interview to restate her view that Farage could be welcomed back into the Tory fold \"if he was supporting the Conservatives and wanted the Conservatives to win\". Farage has now responded, writing on X: \"On the same day that Suella Braverman says she wants me in the Tory party, David Cameron is abusive about me.  \"Sums them up.\" Remember, you need to register to vote by Tuesday 18 June and it only takes about five\nminutes online.

Hannah Miller Political correspondent Capital gains is a tax you pay when you sell an asset which has\ngone up in value. You don\u2019t pay it on your main home, as long as you\u2019ve always lived\nthere - but the Conservatives had been claiming that might change under Labour. Today, Keir Starmer explicitly ruled it out - he said it was never\nthe party\u2019s policy and he can \u201cabsolutely\u201d guarantee it won\u2019t happen over the\nnext parliament. Labour have previously ruled out increasing the rates of income\ntax, VAT, and national insurance - but they\u2019ve often been reluctant to respond\ndirectly on other taxes. The Conservatives have been using it as one of their main lines of\nattack \u2013 you might have heard them saying that Labour is going to \u2018tax your\nhome\u2019. This is a clear attempt to shut that down. Gary O'Donoghue Reporting from the Labour campaign This\nvisit to a hospital was all about Labour's promises on the NHS. But\nafter several days of being asked about whether Labour would rule out putting\ncapital gains tax on the sale of primary residences, we finally got an answer. Keir\nStarmer told us: \u201cIt was never our policy. I'm happy to rule it out.\u201d For the\nwhole of the next Parliament I asked? Yes, he said. It\nbegs the question why he and his team let the Conservatives run with this one\nfor the past week or so; the problem now of course is that the Tories have 17\nother potential taxes Labour hasn't explicitly ruled out and they will\nundoubtedly keep asking about them as well. Gary O'Donoghue Reporting from the Labour campaign I\u2019ve\nnever before heard a hospital ward referred to as an F1 pitstop; but that's how\none of the nurses showing Sir Keir Starmer round described Bassetlaw hospital\u2019s\northopaedic unit. It\nspecialises in elective procedures, but in the evenings and at weekends the\noperating theatre we were shown into is quiet \u2013 not enough staff to keep this\nshiny new facility running and bringing down those waiting lists. That's\nLabour's promise: to get units like this running for longer each week, paying\novertime to staff to get more procedures done. But\nwith NHS staff often reporting just how worn out they feel, Labour doesn't\nreally have an answer to how it will make sure units like this one are busy all\nday every day. Hannah Miller Political correspondent The election campaign is only halfway, but for the Conservative\nParty some soul-searching has already begun. With Reform UK seeing a steady increase in their polling, there is\ngeneral agreement that the failure to bring down migration more quickly is\nresponsible for much of Nigel Farage\u2019s appeal. But what to do about him is less clear. Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, certainly no friend of Farage,\nhas urged the party to reject his \u201cinflammatory\u201d rhetoric on migration, and\ninstead adopt \u201crobust policy and measured language.\u201d But earlier in the week Suella Braverman said she would be willing\nto \u201cwelcome\u201d him into the party. If the Conservatives thought leaving the EU was going to put an end\nto the divisive impact Farage tends to have on their party, there is a\nstrong suggestion that may not be the case. Let's move away from the Lib Dems, and it's another day off the campaign trail for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. At the end of last week he was attending the G7 summit in Italy. The PM is currently watching the Trooping the Colour parade, alongside his wife Akshata Murthy. (You can follow live updates from those events here.) But that's not all. This afternoon, Sunak is expected to attend the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland.  Jenny Hill Reporting from the Lib Dem campaign The sign read \u2018No adults on the jumping pillow\u2019 (it\u2019s a bit\nlike a bouncy castle without the walls) but they made an exception for the\ncampaigning Lib Dem leader and his local candidate.  There were the inevitable quips about creating a bounce in\nthe polls as Ed Davey and Chris Coghlan leapt and slipped about to the laughter\nof watching families. He brushed off questions about Reform\u2019s current position in\nthe polls, saying that the Lib Dems shared no values with Nigel Farage\u2019s\nmovement, adding that his was the only party demanding real political\nchange.  Davey has also been highlighting what the Lib Dems are calling a \"car theft epidemic\" in the UK. His party is pledging to scrap elected police and crime commissioners (PCC) to unlock what they say will be an addition \u00a3170m to bolster frontline policing.  Speaking to the BBC, he says that \"only the Liberal Democrats\" are showing how frontline policing would be improved we do it \"by getting rid of these PCCs\". The party's own analysis of Home Office data found 360,072 unsolved car thefts in England and Wales since the last election. Liberal Democrat analysts claimed there was a 42% rise in unsolved car thefts between 2020 and last year - from 76,333 to 108,934. More now from Ed Davey, this time on immigration. He tells the BBC that there is a need to \"take immigration seriously\" and to \"stop the boats coming across the channel\". The Lib Dem leader then accuses the Tories of having \"failed miserably on all these fronts\",  saying they weren't prepared to work internationally, with European partners and others, to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has congratulated Alan Bates - the former sub-postmaster who successfully campaigned to highlight the Post Office Horizon scandal - on his knighthood. Speaking while out on the campaign trail in Surrey, he tells the BBC that Bates \"fought the system, sometimes singlehandedly, he fought it bravely, and he won\". Asked he if would apologise to sub-postmasters, Davey - who was minister responsible for the Post Office between 2010 and 2012 - says he had apologised for not meeting Bates on his request three weeks after he took office. He adds that he was later the first minister too meet Bates, and that he put his questions to officials and the Post Office. Davey also says he's \"looking forward\" to attending the Post Office inquiry on 18 July.  Andrew Kerr Political correspondent, BBC Scotland A cheery Kate Forbes has been on the campaign trail for\nthe SNP as an overall mood of despondency hangs over Scotland. Political differences were set aside for the big game\nlast night but - despite the result - electioneering begins again in earnest. Forbes is the deputy first minister in the SNP-led\nScottish government. This morning she visited a huge Scottish transport hub in\nLarkhall, South Lanarkshire. It handles the vast majority of Scottish salmon. The party\u2019s ABC message has been clear in this campaign -\nfocusing on austerity, Brexit and the cost of living. Today was B - Brexit. Forbes railed against the UK\u2019s\ndeparture from the EU and about the trade barriers that have gone up. She claims only with independence could Scotland re-join\nthe EU and that SNP MPs would work to protect the food and drink industry here\nand cut Brexit red tape. More now from Johnny Mercer's interview with the BBC - this time on immigration. Mercer acknowledges that his party \u201chaven\u2019t got there fast enough\u201d on bringing\ndown small boat arrivals, though points to the fact that the number of people\narriving by small boat went down by a third last year. For context: More recent figures\nsuggest that the number of people arriving in small boats so far in 2024 are\nhigher than in the previous four years.  Speaking\ngenerally about immigration, he says: \u201cGovernment\u2019s a fight, anything in\ngovernment is difficult and we\u2019re on that trajectory and you can see from the prime minister\u2019s record over the last six to twelve months that we\u2019re making\nprogress. \"But I get people\u2019s frustration, they don\u2019t see it straightaway, I\nshare that frustration.\u201d  Veterans' Minister Johnny Mercer says that Reform UK is rising in the polls because people are \u201cfrustrated\u201d with politicians.  Speaking to the BBC, he says Reform's momentum is down to \"a frustration with politics right, and politicians making commitments that are not fulfilled in a way that they would like to see them fulfilled,\" noting immigration as one example. Asked whether it's his party\u2019s fault that people are frustrated after 14 years of Conservative government, Mercer says it's \u201ceverybody\u2019s fault\u201d, before turning to criticise the Labour Party, accusing them of \u201ctreating people with a lack of respect\u201d.  He also adds that said a vote for Reform would lead to a Labour government and that would be \u201ca disaster\u201d for the country.       The next UK general election will take place on 4 July.   How do people say they will vote in the UK general election?

Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the most significant philosophers of the twentieth century, Philippa Foot (1920 - 2010). Her central question was, \u201cWhy be moral?\u201d Drawing on Aristotle and Aquinas, Foot spent her life working through her instinct that there was something lacking in the prevailing philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s which held that values could only be subjective. Could there really be no objective response to the horrors of the concentration camps that she had seen on newsreels, no way of saying that such acts were morally wrong? Foot developed an ethics based on virtues, in which humans needed virtues to flourish as surely as plants needed light and water. While working through her ideas she explored applied ethics and the difference between doing something and letting it happen, an idea she illustrated with what became The Trolley Problem.

The singer, 65, has been appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity. Le Bon studied drama at university in Birmingham, where Duran Duran was formed. The singer, who was born in Hertfordshire and grew up in Pinner, west London, said: \"What an incredible and totally unexpected honour.\" Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978 Le Bon said the last few years had been \"some of the most important\" in Duran Duran's career. \"It is fitting that the honour has been awarded not just for my role in music, but also for the work I've been fortunate to be involved with outside the band for some of the causes I believe in,\" he said. \"To name but two of them, I hope this moment helps to raise awareness for the Blue Marine Foundation and the importance of their conservation work, and for Centrepoint.\" Pop-rock band Duran Duran formed in 1978 in Birmingham, with Le Bon auditioning to be part of the group two years later. The band's self-titled debut album was released in 1981, with the group achieving 30 top 40 singles in the UK over the past five decades. Le Bon has three children with his wife, model Yasmin Le Bon, whom he married in Oxford in 1985. Duran Duran, which features keyboardist Nick Rhodes, bassist John Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, received a lifetime achievement award in 2011 at the GQ Men Of The Year awards. The group are set to headline Latitude Festival in what will be their \"sole UK performance\" of the summer in July.

In the latest in a series of BBC Panorama interviews with the party leaders, the Labour leader denied wanting to wave a \"magic wand\" to prevent either tax rises or public spending cuts, to deliver on his election promises. Sir Keir also told Nick Robinson he was \"not hostile\" to people who used private healthcare, and ruled out rejoining the European Union. Meanwhile, speaking to journalists at the G7 summit in Italy, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was \"going to fight for every single vote until the last day\". Asked why he thought opinion polls were suggesting some Conservative voters were turning to Reform UK, Mr Sunak said \"we're only halfway through this campaign\".  He also repeated his insistence that \"the Conservatives had a \"tax-cutting manifesto\" whereas Labour was \"going to put your taxes up\". Earlier this week at Labour's manifesto launch, Sir Keir said his was the party of economic growth and would boost wealth creation. Nick Robinson suggested the party was trying to disguise an \u00a318bn hole in Treasury funds - equivalent to 10% of the NHS budget - which would need to be filled either by tax rises or spending cuts to public services. However, Sir Keir said he rejected the choice was simply being \"boxed in\" between tax and spend because there was another lever, which he said was growth. \"My manifesto is about wealth creation,\" he said. \"This is a party of wealth creation, of growth.  \"Therefore this boxing in that everybody is trying to do... that the only levers available to a Labour government or a Labour prime minister is to put up tax or pull down spending - I reject that - growth is the lever that I intend to pull.\" Asked if he was trying to \"wave the magic wand of growth\", Sir Keir said \"it's not a wand, it's a plan\" and outlined how Labour was focused on how to get rid of blocks to business needs that were preventing economic growth. The Labour leader gave the example of a wind turbine that could be built in two years but would instead be held up by the planning process for five years - suggesting he would be willing to override objections to new developments.  When Nick Robinson asked if he was prepared to make enemies in order to drive economic growth, Sir Keir replied: \"Yes - we're going to have to be tough.  \"We're going to have to change the way things are done.\" Following the first leaders' debate, where Sir Keir said he would not use private healthcare himself under any circumstances, Mr Robinson suggested there was some concern the Labour leader thought people who did were \"queue jumpers\". \"I'm not hostile in the slightest,\" Sir Keir said. \"I completely understand why people would go private... because they wanted to get an operation more quickly or get back to work or something else.\" But he defended the NHS as the best performer on acute care saying it was \"the very best place to be\" for the treatment of life-threatening illness, adding that private hospitals \"refer into the NHS for acute care\" for that reason. This video can not be played UK can do better than Johnson's 'botched' post-Brexit trade deal - Starmer On Brexit, Sir Keir was pressed on whether he wanted to re-join the European Union having campaigned for Remain and also calling for the option of a second referendum as Shadow Brexit Secretary, before ruling out a re-entry last year. The Labour leader ruled out re-joining, saying he respected the vote and that membership of the EU was \"not a silver bullet\".  The post-Brexit trade deals were \"botched\", he said, and Labour would negotiate a better Brexit trade deal if it wins 4 July's general election, but many issues around growth could be fixed without undoing Brexit.  \"I do think we can do better than the botched deal that we've got under Boris Johnson,\" he said. \"I think every business thinks that.\"  He added: \"If you look at the problems for growth over the last 14 years, they were there, or many of them were there, before Brexit, so the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept.\" At the G7, Mr Sunak said there was a clear choice between the two parties and he would \"continue fighting very hard to make sure everyone understands the choice that's ahead of them\". He claimed that electing Labour would give Sir Keir \"a blank cheque\" to hike taxes, whereas, if the Tories were re-elected, \"we will be able to cut taxes for people at every stage of their lives\".  Turning to the single opinion poll which put Reform ahead of the Conservatives, the Prime Minister said the only poll that mattered was the one on July 4th. Other opinion polls have put the Tories ahead of Nigel Farage's party.   Mr Sunak also pledged to stay on as an MP for a full five-year parliamentary term even if the Conservatives lost on 4 July.

Kate Rackham was diagnosed with oestrogen-receptive breast cancer at the age of 39. The Manchester-based teacher, who shared updates on her life with her 17,000 followers on the X platform, helped set up the Fighting to be Heard charity to raise awareness of the condition and provide support for those with the condition. A post on the 46-year-old's account on Thursday read: \u201cIf you\u2019re reading this, it means I have died. But do not cry for me. I have lived my life on my own terms, the way I have wanted to.\u201d In her post, she said she had joined the social media platform \u201cbecause I needed an outlet\u201d but \u201cwhat I got was so much more\u201d. \u201cYou made me feel validated in my feelings and much less alone. Thank you.\u201d Former BBC newsreader Beccy Barr, who attended the same school and has been diagnosed with abdominal cancer, posted a tribute, saying: \u201cIn recent months we reconnected and she was incredibly empathic and supportive of my terminal diagnosis as she handled her own. What a wonderful woman.\u201d Nicola Nuttall, whose daughter Laura, 23, died of brain cancer while achieving a bucket list of ambitions, posted that she was \"heartbroken that we\u2019ve lost this truly incredible woman\". Speaking about climbing Pendle Hill with Ms Rackham, in memory of Laura, Nicola added: \"Kate really knew how to live, she wanted to come up Pendle but wouldn\u2019t wait for better weather because she knew better than anyone the value of a single day. \"We nearly got blown off but it was brilliant, so glad we met.\" Allow Twitter content?

It's not just losing your hair, it's losing your eyelashes and eyebrows as well. \u201cThat's the difference between looking like you are rocking a bald head and looking like you are on chemotherapy,\u201d she said. She said her diagnosis \"came as a massive shock\", and that prior to it, she had lumps that she had got checked out, but with no family history she was told not to worry. When she noticed another lump, she said she did not get it checked straight away.

Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was on a lorry in the convoy, also said that while waiting at a checkpoint he witnessed the fatal shooting of two Gazan fishermen. In their response, the Israel Defense Forces said documentation for the Unicef vehicle in the convoy was not filled out correctly and accused Mr Elder of presenting a \"partial picture\". Mr Elder said people had told him they would be \"happy if there is an air strike\" on their homes, to end their suffering. Unicef says it is seeing increasing malnutrition among children in Gaza In an interview with the BBC's Today programme, Mr Elder said: \u201cThey\u2019re so despairing, they\u2019re so broken, they\u2019ve lost so many family members, they have nothing left.\u201d He said the areas of Gaza being denied aid were suffering from levels of severe malnutrition unprecedented in Gaza. He added that doctors in Gaza had needed to be trained to deal with the most serious cases as they had not experienced them in the past. His remarks came after World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that a significant proportion of Gaza's population were facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\". More than 8,000 children under five years old had been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition, of whom more than 1,500 had a more severe form, Dr Tedros added. More than 37,000 people have been killed, and many hundreds of thousands more injured or displaced in Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  Israel and Hamas placed on UN list for violating children's rights Mass graves and body bags: al-Shifa hospital after Israel withdrew its forces 'Forced to speak in a whisper' - Hamas hostage's 'miracle' rescue Mr Elder described how on Wednesday he was travelling on a Unicef lorry in an aid convoy trying to get from southern to northern Gaza. He said that despite having all the necessary paperwork it took them 13 hours to travel about 40km (30 miles). After spending eight hours at checkpoints they were finally denied entry, he said, \"so 10,000 children who were going to benefit from nutritional supplies, medical supplies, did not\". Mr Elder said he did not know why the convoy was denied entry, but said such denials were \"consistent and relentless\" and that there were hundreds of examples. The IDF said in a statement that a problem arose because Unicef had used a lorry with a rear closed cabin which required prior coordination with the authorities, adding that Hamas frequently exploited closed cabins to smuggle weapons and terrorists into northern Gaza. It said Unicef had initially claimed the lorry did not include a closed cabin but this claim turned out to be false. \"Once the situation was clarified, [Unicef] was offered to continue its movement northward without the mentioned truck or to submit appropriate coordination for the following day,\" the IDF added. \"As long as the coordination process is properly conducted, passage will be allowed,\" the statement continued. Mr Elder also said that during the checkpoint wait he saw about eight fishermen trying to catch fish with a single net.  \"Suddenly we heard a tank coming down, we heard... automatic fire,\" he said. \"We saw two men on the beach, two fishermen fleeing, one was shot in the back, one in the neck.\" The Unicef spokesman said the WHO, who had paramedics in the convoy, called through to the IDF to be allowed to give the men medical support, but that support was denied. He said he was later able to see the fishermen's wounds when their colleagues were allowed to retrieve the bodies. The IDF said it was looking into what it described as the \"incident on the beach which was mentioned in the interview\".  Mr Elder, who was last in Gaza six weeks ago, said things were much worse now. \"It's the first time I've seen a real level of despondency,\" he said. \"It's very unsettling to see a child when their parent can't protect them, it's heartbreaking when a parent can't protect their child, so increasingly I'm hearing people say I just want this over, I'm happy if there's an air strike on me tonight.\" Speaking again to the BBC on Saturday, Mr Elder warned against the normalisation of this \"horror show on children\".  \"There is nothing normal about walking through this hospital, speaking to a mother as I did 10 minutes ago, who was asleep in her family home when a rocket hit. Next thing she's in the rubble three floors below, two of her children are killed and the third... has serious head injuries.\" Putin peace terms slammed at Ukraine summit Kate returns to public events at Trooping the Colour What does Nigel Farage really want?

The decision, which came two years after the court rescinded the nationwide guarantee to an abortion, was welcomed by pro-choice activists. The justices decided the plaintiffs, a group of anti-abortion doctors and activists, did not have a legal right to sue.  But they left the door open to other attempts to limit the availability of the drug. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, now the most common method of terminating pregnancies in the US.  The plaintiffs, known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, had argued that approval for the drug from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be withdrawn.  But during arguments on the case in March, several of the court's nine justices sounded sceptical that any of the plaintiffs had suffered harm from the availability of mifepristone - which is necessary to have the legal standing to sue.  \"The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological objections to elective abortion and to FDA's relaxed regulation,\" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh for the court, \"but they failed to demonstrate\" any actual injury.  \"A plaintiff\u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue,\"  he also wrote.  The top court overturned Roe v Wade, effectively rescinding a federal right to abortion, in June 2022. Since then, 21 states have moved to restrict abortion earlier in pregnancy than the standard it had set. Seventeen of those have barred the procedure at six weeks or earlier. Thursday's ruling has no bearing on these laws - medication abortion remains illegal in states that prohibit abortion. But abortion pills have acted as an effective workaround to the bans, with thousands of pills flowing into restrictive states through the mail.  Pro-choice activists were encouraged that access to abortion pills had been preserved, but warned the Supreme Court's decision was a qualified victory.  At least three states - Missouri, Kansas and Idaho - have also opposed the FDA's approval of the drug in court. The Supreme Court's decision on Thursday does not rule out these future challenges.  \"This ruling is not a \u2018win\u2019 for abortion, it just maintains the status quo,\" said Nancy Northup, president of the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement.  \"The attacks on abortion pills will not stop here - the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world.\" In a statement, President Joe Biden echoed those comments, saying the ruling \"does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues\". \"The stakes could not be higher for women across America,\" he said.  Anti-abortion groups criticised the decision. But these groups, too, indicated the fight would continue.   \"It is a sad day for all who value women\u2019s health and unborn children\u2019s lives,\" said Katie Daniel, state policy director for Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.  \"But the fight to stop dangerous mail-order abortion drugs is not over.\" Abortion is expected to be a leading issue at the ballot box this autumn.  Since Roe v Wade was overturned, it has posed a problem for some Republicans, caught between a base that opposes the abortion, and a general electorate that broadly supports access to the procedure, external.  Anti-abortion movement stalls as election year looms How safe is the abortion pill mifepristone? This video can not be played Texas abortion law:  'I waited for my daughter to die so I wouldn't die' In recent months, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called for compromise from his party members, suggesting strict bans were politically costly.  On Thursday morning, speaking to House Republicans, Trump seemed to advocate for exceptions to anti-abortion laws, saying \"like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of the mother, rape and incest\". He added: \"But you have to follow your own heart.\"  The two-drug regimen was approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy by the FDA in 2000. A patient is first given mifepristone to induce an abortion and then misoprostol to empty the uterus. Since 2016, the FDA has eased access to the drug and allowed doctors to hold virtual appointments with patients and for prescriptions to be sent by mail. Those more recent approvals were at question in this case.  Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US now are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports access to the procedure.  More than a million pregnancies were terminated in the US last year, the highest number in over a decade, says the institute. Throughout two decades of use, the FDA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and other mainstream medical organisations have maintained that both mifepristone and misoprostol are safe for women to use.  US studies say medication abortion is about 95% effective in ending pregnancy and requires further medical follow-up less than 1% of the time.

The court ruled by a 6-3 majority that the government did not have the right to ban the accessories. The Trump administration banned bump stocks after they were used in a shooting that killed 60 people at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017. But a Texas gun shop owner who challenged the ban said the government went too far in defining the accessories as machine guns, which are mostly illegal under federal law - with some exceptions - and took his fight all the way to America's highest court. US law prohibits the transfer or possession of machine guns made after 19 May 1986, the effective prohibition date. However, transfer or possession of machine guns lawfully obtained before that date is legal. The court said a semi-automatic rifle with an attachment does not qualify as a machine gun under federal law. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, written by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had \u201cexceeded\u201d its authority. The court, quoting part of the legal definition of machine guns, said rifles with a bump stock \"cannot fire more than one shot 'by a single function of the trigger', and even if they could, they would not do so 'automatically'\". What are bump stocks?  The split decision saw the three liberal justices on the conservative-dominated, nine-member court dissent: Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Sotomayor said: \"Today, the Court puts bump stocks back in civilian hands.\"  A decision which she said \"will have deadly consequences\".  On whether weapons with the accessory should qualify as machine guns, she said: \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\"  In the 1986 Firearms Act, machine guns are defined as any \"weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\". During a hearing on the case in March, some justices on the conservative-led court  appeared sceptical of the ban, drawing attention to the minor technical differences of how a bump-stock gun fires compared to a machine gun.   At the time, Justice Neil Gorsuch said he could understand \u201cwhy these items should be made illegal\u201d, but said that doing so explicitly was Congress\u2019s role. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson countered, saying bump stocks are just \u201cthe kinds of weapons Congress was intending to bar because of the damage they do\u201d. The bump stock harnesses a rifle's recoil to rapidly fire multiple rounds. It replaces the weapon's stock, which is held against the shoulder, and allows the gun to slide back and forward between the user's shoulder and trigger finger. That motion - or bump - lets the gun fire without the user having to move their finger. The attacker in the Las Vegas shooting had attached bump stocks to 12 of his semi-automatic rifles which allowed him to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, the same rate as many machine guns. He killed 60 people and wounded hundreds more who had gathered for a music festival. A spokeswomen for Donald Trump's campaign, whose administration enacted the original ban,  told the BBC that \"the court has spoken and their decision should be respected\". A spokesman for President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to debate Trump on 27 June as the two candidates bid for re-election, criticised the decision. \u201cWeapons of war have no place on the streets of America,\" they said.

The gym in Incheon city near the capital Seoul put up a sign that read \"off limits to ajummas\" and \"only cultivated and elegant women allowed\". Ajumma is a catch-all term for older women - typically late-30s onwards - but is also a pejorative for behaviour that is seen as rude or obnoxious.  Local reports did not name the gym or its owner, who defended the move, claiming that his company had \"suffered damages\" because of these women and their unruly behaviour.  \u201c[Some older women customers] would spend an hour or two in the changing room to do their laundry, steal items including towels, soaps, or hair dryers,\u201d he said in a televised interview with South Korean news agency Yonhap. \u201cThey would sit in a row and comment and judge other people\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said, adding that some younger women have quit the gym because of these comments, which upset them or made them uncomfortable. While the move was made by a single gym, it seems to have struck a nerve because in recent years, South Korean businesses have drawn flak for banning children or seniors from certain public places.  Some of this has been seen as proof of growing intolerance for specific age groups. The gym has also drawn criticism for conflating bad behaviour with women of a certain age.  \u201cHow did the term 'bad customer' become the same as 'ajumma'?\", read one comment on local social media website instiz. \"If you have worked in the service industry, you\u2019d know that it\u2019s not just older women who fall into those categories.\u201d  Another comment described the move as a sign of outdated attitudes, calling it \"sentiments of the early 2000s\u201d.   Why women in Korea are reclaiming their short hair Why South Korean women aren't having babies The Korean women defying beauty standards The gym defended itself by pointing to an additional notice that tried to distinguish between ajummas and women. It says that ajummas tend to \"like free stuff regardless of their age\", and that they are \"stingy with their own money but not with other people's money\". The gym's owner also said there may be other business owners who share his sentiments but have not spoken out. \"It\u2019s not that I tried to make a hate comment against older women or women in general,\" he told Yonhap. \"I think people who are enraged by [the notice] are in fact the ones with the problem.\" The ban did find support among some people online, who also seemed to associate  ill manners with older or middle-aged women. Some described them as \"territorial\",  while others used insulting language, calling them \"senseless\".   \"The ladies are annoying... They take their kids to restaurants and cafes. They are oblivious and abusive,\" read one comment on YouTube.  There were multiple references to children, with the main notion being that these women took up a lot of space or attention in public spaces.  South Korean women have long fought for non-traditional choices - from short hair to singledom - in a society that holds them to often unyielding standards. Women say men are rarely judged for similar behaviour.   Commentators too have pointed out that there was no need to single out women at all, when older men are just as likely to behave badly.  \u201cOlder men behave the same,\" psychology professor Park Sang-hee said in an interview with television network JTBC, following the ban. \"Older men also obsess over free stuff and repeat themselves over and over again.

Standedge Tunnel, pictured at the Marsden end, is the longest, highest and deepest tunnel in the UK Dubbed one of the seven wonders of the waterways, Standedge Tunnel took 17 years to dig by hand. A Canal & River Trust spokesperson described it as an \"extraordinary feat of engineering\". Sean McGinley, the trust's regional director for Yorkshire & North East, said the tours had been introduced because the charity was \"working harder than ever to keep our historic 250-year-old canal network alive\". \"This experience is one of the many ways people can help support our work, contributing to the vital funds needed to help us maintain our 2,000-mile network of canals and assets, while discovering this amazing treasure under the Pennines,\" he added. Gordon McMinn, pictured at the tunnel's Marsden end, described the structure as \"remarkable\" A total of 18 one-way paddle trips would be offered between June and August for either two people in a tandem canoe or solo paddlers, with a fee being charged, the trust said.

Karen Foster, 62, left Harlow Collinge with unsurvivable brain injuries after he had been dropped off at her home by his mother Gemma Collinge, the court heard. Harlow was taken to hospital from the address in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, on 1 March, 2022, but died four days later. Following sentencing, his family said they had lost their son \"in the most horrific of circumstances\". Karen Foster told a paramedic that Harlow had \"suddenly collapsed\" Foster was due to stand trial at Preston Crown Court for his murder last week but the prosecution accepted a plea of manslaughter. The basis of her plea was that her \"forceful shaking\" caused Harlow's death after he fell out of his high chair and began crying, the court heard. Foster, a registered childminder with nine years experience, called 999 to say he was not breathing, and told a paramedic he had \"suddenly collapsed\". After Harlow was rushed away by ambulance, Foster hugged his mother at the hospital and claimed the youngster had begun choking and that she had slapped him on the back. But she later tried to blame Ms Collinge for the injuries. Harlow died days later in his parents\u2019 arms having suffered massive brain injuries. Foster, despite claiming benefits for ill health, had been breaking Ofsted rules on the numbers and ages of children she should have been caring for, to make more money from parents, the court heard. Relatives of Harlow shouted \"scumbag\" and \"I hate you\" as Foster was led away from the dock after being sentenced by High Court judge Mr Justice Barry Cotter. The judge described Harlow as a \"happy, healthy, much-loved\" boy, but said that Foster, despite ill health and pain in her hip, chose to carry on looking after more children than she should have under Ofsted rules, and this had contributed to her \"loss of temper\". He said: \"I have no doubt you snapped on the 1st of March 2022, in part due to the fact that you were not coping with the demands of caring for four children.  \"You lost your temper and he was on the receiving end. \"You shook an (almost) 10-month-old child so violently to cause devastating injuries. His death was caused in the course of an assault.\" In a statement, Harlow's family said: \"We do not know where to begin explaining what it is like losing our son in the most horrific of circumstances. \"Our boy\u2019s life has been taken away by a horrible, fake individual, who we trusted and who promised to care for him. \"No words can describe how it has ruined our lives.\" Harlow's mother, father Allen Frangleton, older siblings and wider family, sat in the public gallery, weeping as Foster's case was heard and their victim impact statements were read out. Ms Collinge spoke of the \"guilt\" she felt, having made arrangements to move Harlow to a nursery six weeks after first using Foster as a childminder, due to her own concerns about the number of children being looked after. \"All the red flags I missed,\" she continued before recalling Foster trying to comfort her at the hospital, claiming Harlow had choked on pasta. This video can not be played Harlow Collinge's mother says son's death has 'ruined lives' She added: \"She even put her arms around me. I can't think of anything more evil. It is despicable. I blame myself every day for my son's death. This monster, Karen Foster, deserves nothing. I hope her actions haunt her.\"  Det Supt Allen Davies, of Lancashire Police, said: \u201cThe case of evidence proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Foster was solely responsible for Harlow\u2019s unlawful killing, meaning Foster finally admitted her guilt last week. \u201cMy thoughts remain with Harlow\u2019s family who have behaved with dignity while dealing with such an unimaginable and unexpected loss.\u201d Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Some 8,000 sq m of tunnels that run under High Holborn were built in 1942 as an air raid shelter to provide protection during the Blitz. Later, they were used as a home for the British spy organisation, the Special Operations Executive. The labyrinth, known as the Kingsway Tunnels, featured in the first James Bond novel. The tunnels have remained unused since they were decommissioned in 1990. The plans include an underground bar The plans were approved by the City of London Corporation on Tuesday, but Camden Council still has to approve them. A history and heritage section would \u201ccurate the history of the site through a historic timeline by displaying the retained and restored telecommunications equipment\". The plans also include educational facilities, exhibition spaces and an underground bar.  The submission notes the tunnels could also be used to host exhibitions on themes \"such as James Bond\". The space is expected to be able to accommodate hundreds of people at a time, leading to an estimated \u00a360-\u00a380m of additional expenditure in the area each year, according to those behind the project. Free visits are also to be offered to London schools, with a minimum of 40 children expected each week. Angus Murray, chief executive at the London Tunnels, described the proposal as \u201ca restoration of an existing asset\". He said there was a \"tremendous story\" to be told, including that of the London Blitz, adding that the project would deliver financial benefits and align with the City\u2019s local plans, such as the City Plan 2040 and Destination City.

An investigation took place into hundreds of complaints over contributions to a Warwickshire County Council scrutiny panel debate in January. Jeff Morgan, Brian Hammersley and Clare Golby have all been cleared of breaching the authority's code of conduct. The investigation found Mr Morgan and Mr Hammersley had been entitled to make comments, although disrespectful, under freedom of speech protections, while Ms Golby's words were not deemed to have been disrespectful. The three were debating analysis which addressed some of the demand and cost pressures that had led to overspends for authorities around the country. Comments surrounded the scale of demand, with Mr Morgan questioning whether some children put forward for assessments were \"just really badly behaved\" and in need of \"some form of strict correction\". Mr Hammersley asked whether a surge in demand was down to \"something in the water\" and Ms Golby referred to social media pages where \"families are swapping tips on how to get their children diagnosed\". The investigation found Mr Morgan and Mr Hammersley had failed to be respectful, \"champion the needs of the whole community\" and uphold the reputation of the council, but also that they had been entitled to make the comments under freedom of speech protections. Ms Golby's words were deemed not to have been disrespectful, nor to have caused reputational damage or a failure to champion the needs of the whole community.

It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.

BBC News has analysed spills data from nine firms, which suggests sewage may have been discharged nearly 6,000 times when it had not been raining in 2022 - including during the country\u2019s record heatwave. Water companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it\u2019s dry. The firms say they understand public concerns around dry spilling, but they disagree with the BBC\u2019s findings. They have said the spill data shared with the Environment Agency was \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201cunverified\u201d, and also disagree with how the BBC defined a dry spill, which they say differs from the Environment Agency\u2019s approach. Why is sewage released into rivers and the sea? England sewage spills more than double in 2023 The latest findings follow a BBC investigation conducted last year which found 388 instances of possible dry spilling in 2022 by three water companies - Thames, Wessex and Southern - after they shared their data with the BBC. The other six \u2013 Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Severn Trent, South West Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water - had refused to share data about when they might be spilling with the BBC. They said it could prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation by the Environment Agency, external (EA) and Ofwat into their activities, external. The regulator \u2013 the Environment Agency \u2013 which had the data, disagreed, and in January handed it to the BBC. Speaking to the BBC before the election, Helen Wakeham, head of water at the EA, said the whole point of monitoring was to increase transparency, and they wanted to make the data more publicly available. Overflow points where sewage is discharged have monitors which record when spills start and stop. The BBC cross-referenced the companies\u2019 spill data from these overflow points with local Met Office rainfall data. Over 18 months we analysed data from nearly 10,000 monitors which had recorded more than 1.5 million hours of discharges. BBC analysis suggests dry spills may have started on more than 200 days in 2022, lasting more than 29,000 hours \u2013 including during the record summer heatwave when people were cooling off in England\u2019s rivers and seas. \u201cWe are most concerned about those [spill] events happening in places where people are likely to go in the river,\u201d said Professor Barbara Evans, chair in public health engineering at the University of Leeds. Consumption of water contaminated with human or animal faeces exposes people to parasites and bacteria such as cryptosporidium and E.coli, which cause diarrhoea and vomiting, or viruses like hepatitis A which can lead to liver infection. The six water companies who were subject of the latest investigation took issue with the BBC\u2019s analysis, citing the data we used and the methodology. Every year England\u2019s water companies are required to submit an annual report to the EA summarising their discharges. This enables the EA to investigate potential cases of dry spills and to decide whether it will take any action. The BBC has been analysing data behind the 2022 report, but in responding to our findings, the water companies argue that the datasets are unverified and contain errors. Examples of potential dry spills in the data were presented to each water company. Anglian Water disagreed with all the examples presented and the remaining five companies disagreed with some. The main reason the companies gave for disputing the examples was that their monitors malfunctioned and incorrectly recorded spills. From 2025, all water companies have committed to publishing near real-time sewage maps for the public to increase transparency. They will use the data from these monitors to create the maps. David Henderson, CEO of the industry body, Water UK, told the BBC: \u201cWe are the most transparent industry in the world when it comes to water. No other country in the world publishes this sort of data.\u201d In May, Anglian Water was found guilty of failing to provide data to the Environment Agency for their investigation \u2013 and it will be sentenced in July. The water industry has committed to spending \u00a3100bn between 2025 and 2030 Regarding the BBC\u2019s methodology, some of the water companies argue it did not take into account that some outlets have large catchment areas and it can take a few days for any rainfall to drain through their systems, i.e. sewage detected on a dry day may be the remnants from an earlier rainy day. However, the BBC accounted for drain-down time by only considering a discharge a potential dry spill when there had been four consecutive days in the surrounding area without rain. Helen Wakeham from the EA says the BBC\u2019s methodology is, in fact, \u201cmore generous\u201d to the companies than the EA\u2019s. Commenting on the results of the BBC\u2019s investigation in general she said: \u201cI'm not surprised, these networks haven't been invested in for decades. That investment needs to take place.\u201d In May the UK\u2019s top engineers and medical professionals warned in a public report the risk from human faecal matter in our rivers will increase without changes to the network and how we build our cities. Dr David Butler, professor of water engineering at the University of Exeter, and co-author of the report, said investment from water companies has \u201cnot really been up to scratch\u201d. But he added that we must also rethink how we design our towns and cities. \u201cWhat we would like to see is reversing urban creep - that is well beyond the powers of a water company. You see it all the time, people concreting over their front garden,\u201d Prof Butler explained. \u201cIf you could unpick that it would help because that would reduce stormwater runoff and that would give us more capacity in our pipes.\u201d Reducing dry spilling would also help prevent excessive nutrients entering rivers from sewage discharging. The issue, which is also associated with agriculture, can cause excessive amounts of algae to grow, resulting in waterways becoming depleted of oxygen, killing off other animals like fish. \u201c[It] also can have knock-on health effects, because this algae can produce other toxic products which might be harmful to human health,\u201d said Prof Evans of University of Leeds. South West Water said: \u201cWe are clear that storm overflows must only be used when absolutely necessary to protect people\u2019s homes and regard all unpermitted dry spills as unacceptable.\u201d Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water said they: \u201cDo not believe the [BBC\u2019s findings] are true reflection of dry discharge numbers.\u201d United Utilities said: \u201cThe information you have received from the Environment Agency reflects unvalidated, raw signals and not validated start\/stop times.\u201d Anglian declined to provide a formal comment on the BBC analysis, but in correspondence to the BBC said that the monitor data was not enough to determine dry spills due to monitor malfunctions, and said the methodology was flawed. The three companies investigated by the BBC last year also responded to our new findings. A Thames Water spokesperson said: \u201cThere are a number of methodologies for defining and calculating why and how dry day spills occur. \u201cWe regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable, and we have planned investment in our sewage treatment works to reduce the need for untreated discharges.\u201d A Wessex Water spokesperson said: \u201cNaturally occurring groundwater can enter sewers, often from private pipes and in dry weather, which can cause overflows to operate for days or even months. \u201cWe agree overflows are outdated so we\u2019re investing \u00a33 million a month to help reduce how often they automatically operate.\u201d A spokesperson for Southern Water said: \u201cIn areas with high levels of residual groundwater, spills can happen outside of periods of rainfall. Without these releases \u2013 made up almost entirely of groundwater \u2013 homes and communities would be flooded. \u201cCombatting these groundwater spills is a key part of our \u00a31.5 billion Clean Rivers and Seas Plan, which is designed to drastically reduce all storm overflows across our region by 2030.\u201d Water and sewerage companies are responsible for outlets known as combined sewer overflows (CSOs), which release sewage from treatment works or the sewage network into the UK's waterways. The majority of CSOs record when they discharge. For this analysis, the BBC took the start-stop times of individual discharges from the CSOs and converted them into the standard 12\/24-hour counting blocks used by the EA to determine \"spills\". In the specific case of United Utilities, the BBC found that some of the discharge data provided to the EA did not correspond to their 2022 annual report summarising this data. For that reason, the BBC discounted data from more than one-third of United's overflows. The start times of the companies' spills were matched to daily rainfall data from the Met Office, which is produced from a network of automatic rainfall gauges and observation stations. This rainfall data is presented in gridded squares that cover the land area of the UK. Each grid cell is 1km sq. Each overflow point is part of a larger network, or catchment area, and rain further away can take time to reach the overflow point. The BBC considered the nine grid squares nearest to each spill site in the analysis. Individual catchment areas may be larger or smaller. The EA defines a dry day as one during which there was less than 0.25mm of rain and less than 0.25mm of rain the previous day. But the BBC took a conservative approach of four consecutive days without rain in all nine grid squares to allow for drain-down time. The methodology was independently reviewed by three academic experts working in this field.

He had travelled from his home in Llandudno to hear former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells give evidence, breaking her near-decade long silence. \u201cIt was all a bit of a surprise,\u201d Sir Alan, as he is now known, told the BBC. He was told that he had to let the Honours Committee know by the end of the day whether he would accept. For the last 15 years, Sir Alan has campaigned for justice for hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongfully prosecuted for theft and false accounting, when faulty software called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their accounts. He had already rejected the offer of an OBE last year, telling the Honours Committee that it would be inappropriate to accept it whilst Ms Vennells kept hold of her CBE for services to the Post Office and many victims continued to suffer. Ms Vennells handed back her CBE earlier this year amid mounting pressure in the aftermath of the ITV drama in January which sparked national outrage over the scandal. \u201cI went and had a confidential talk with somebody who knows what\u2019s gone on over the years and they said to me, 'well you\u2019ve done the heavy lifting, others are doing the rest now.' And on reflection, I knew so many people who were keen for me to actually receive something, I felt I would be insulting them as much as anyone else if I refused it at this time,\" Sir Alan said.

Tracey Emin on becoming a dame and getting cancer all-clear He insisted the honour was not just for him but also for his group, the Justice for Sub-Postmasters Alliance, which he started in 2009. \u201cI think it\u2019s another string to my bow to try and drive the rest of the campaign home. We have got to get funding for everybody. And that\u2019s been my priority now for some time. And if it helps there, then great. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Sir Alan said his work was far from finished, adding that he would pursue court action, if necessary, to get financial redress for the victims who took part in the original High Court action that helped expose the Horizon IT scandal. \u201cI think the nation will support us if we have to go ahead with another case,\u201d he said. The former sub-postmaster's dogged pursuit of the truth began after refusing to accept losses at his own post office which he took over in 1998. Had he ever thought about giving up and letting it go? \u201cI could never do that. We\u2019ve all seen the horror stories, and there are so many. I keep hearing from so many more these days who are coming out of the woodwork and stories that have never been told. I mean, they\u2019re absolutely diabolical.  \"What\u2019s happened to people is very sad but at least they\u2019re now starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel for themselves.\u201d He described his work as the best unpaid job he\u2019d ever had and said he was looking forward to having a holiday this summer. Many congratulated Sir Bates on his knighthood including a victim of the Post Office scandal, Christopher Head, who said he was a \"hero\" and that the knighthood was \u201cthoroughly well-deserved\u201d.

It expands a December programme to target foreign banks deemed to be aiding Russia's war effort in Ukraine. The US also placed sanctions on the Moscow stock exchange, leading to it halting trading in dollars and euros. It also moved to try to restrict Russia's use of technology, including chips and software. US President Joe Biden signed an executive order in December that imposed sanctions on banks dealing with about 1,200 individuals and companies deemed to be helping Russia's war machine. Those measures, which expose banks to the risk of being cut off from the US financial system, have now been expanded to about 4,500 entities. The US will also target gold-laundering. Peter Harrell, a former White House senior director for international economics, told the Reuters news agency that the US \"is shifting towards something that begins to look like an effort to set up a global financial embargo on Russia\". As part of this effort, the US Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on parts of Russia's financial system, including the Moscow Exchange, which is one of Russia's main stock exchanges. The stock exchange, which is Russia's largest foreign exchange market, said the sanctions had forced it to stop trading in dollars and euros. The US also focused on technology. Chips and other technology made in the US have been found in downed Russian equipment on Ukraine battlefields, including drones, radios, missiles and armoured vehicles. The sanctions aim to make it more difficult for companies to supply that tech. The US will target shell firms in Hong Kong selling chips to Russia. In addition, software and IT services will also be restricted, although the US said its actions \"are not intended to disrupt civil society and civil telecommunications\". Despite the wave of sanctions brought against Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund predicts that the country will record economic growth of 3.2% this year.  But analysts said the measures will eventually make it harder for Moscow to wage its war, and over time weaken Russia's economy. \u201cRussia\u2019s war economy is deeply isolated from the international financial system, leaving the Kremlin\u2019s military desperate for access to the outside world,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. \u201cToday\u2019s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries,\" she added. The US announced the decision as Mr Biden prepared for a G7 summit in southern Italy with the leaders of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. One of the G7 leaders' priorities is boosting support for Ukraine, which is now into its third year of resisting Russia's invasion.

The money will be used to support police operations in theft hotspots, as well as to fund intelligence gathering. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s boss angrily denied reports that Range Rovers were particularly vulnerable to theft. However, owners have complained that insurers have been hiking their premiums dramatically, or even refusing cover. Among them is Meryl Cabellos, a 41-year-old Frenchman who has lived in the UK for seven years, and works in the technology industry. Last year, the cost of insuring his 2017 Range Rover Sport doubled, from \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000. He then discovered that his insurer would not be able to renew his cover at all this year \u2013 and struggled to find a replacement. Meryl Cabellos says he loved his Range Rover Sport but sold it because the insurance became too expensive Faced with a best quote of \u00a310,000, and with the car itself losing value rapidly, he decided to cut his losses and sell it. \u201cWe\u2019ve been Range Rover customers for many years, and it really feels as though we\u2019re being priced out now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just really disappointed. We loved the car but because of the insurance the experience of owning it went downhill so quick.\u201d Insurance costs can vary considerably, with factors such as the driver\u2019s record and experience, as well as where the car is kept and the security features it contains all taken into account. Expensive, luxury cars are often targeted by thieves, because they can be sold abroad at a big profit. That, in turn, can push up premiums. For Jaguar Land Rover, this has become a problem. The company builds a range of premium models, with the Range Rover brand a particular favourite for celebrities, politicians and even royalty. Gang jailed for \u00a3500,000 keyless car thefts  Stolen cars 'worth \u00a31m' found during police raid That kind of prestige comes at a cost. The Range Rover starts at \u00a3104,000 while its smaller sibling, the Range Rover Sport, is on sale from \u00a375,000. But embarrassingly for the company, it also has a reputation for being vulnerable to theft. Earlier this year, JLR\u2019s chief executive Adrian Mardell condemned reports that suggested the Range Rover was Britain\u2019s \u201cmost stolen vehicle\u201d. He admitted that vehicle theft by organised criminals was a serious issue in the UK, but insisted his own business had been unfairly singled out, and that strenuous efforts had been made to improve vehicle security. He accused the insurance industry of failing to take account of all the available information when setting premiums. The police funding is the latest in a series of moves designed to reassure consumers and attempt to bring down insurance costs. Last year, for example, the company set up its own insurance products in an effort to help customers who were unable to obtain cover, though some Range Rover owners claim they have still been unable to obtain quotes.  The new money, JLR says, will be used to support several police forces \u201cwith additional dedicated resources to respond to vehicle thefts across the country\u201d. It will also help pay for a new national policing unit to gather intelligence on vehicle thefts, and increased police activity at the ports used by criminal gangs to ship cars abroad. The company says it is already sharing information with the police to help them find and recover vehicles, and has provided training to some 650 officers. At the same time, it says it has been working hard to make its vehicles less vulnerable to theft. It cites data from the Police National Computer showing that since January 2022 only 0.2% of new Range Rovers and Range Rover Sports have been stolen.

It is not yet clear how the issue was discovered or whether it was specifically related to people working from home.  The US bank said staff had been fired or resigned \"after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work\". New rules recently came into effect in the US which mean that brokers working from home must be inspected every three years.  A spokeswoman for the firm said: \"Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behaviour.\" In 2022, Wells Fargo said it had adopted a hybrid flexible working model with staff permitted to work from home some of the time. Some large companies have been using increasingly sophisticated tools to monitor employees since remote work expanded during the Covid pandemic. Such services can track keystrokes and eye movements, take screenshots and log which websites are visited. But technology has also evolved to evade the surveillance, including so-called \"mouse jigglers\" which are aimed at making computers appear to be in active use which are widely available. According to Amazon, where they can be found for less than $10, thousands have been sold in the last month. Bloomberg, which first reported the move based on a filing Wells Fargo made to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said that more than a dozen people had been affected.  The BBC has confirmed six instances in which staff had been discharged after review, and one case in which a person resigned voluntarily after being confronted with the claims. Many of them had worked for Wells Fargo for less than five years. Many firms, especially in the financial industry, are pushing staff to return to the office.  Remote work has remained popular since the pandemic but numbers have been drifting lower.  In the US, just under 27% of paid days last month were work-from-home days, compared with more than 60% at the height of the pandemic in 2020, according to research by professors at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico (ITAM) Business School, Stanford and University of Chicago. As of this spring, about 13% of full-time employees in the US were fully remote, and another 26% enjoyed a hybrid arrangement, according to the researchers.

It is one of two new inquiries involving Boeing planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently confirmed. The agency is also involved after Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes. The issues have emerged at a time when the safety record of Boeing planes is under intense scrutiny. Boeing referred questions about the Southwest flight to the airline, which said it was co-operating with the investigation.  Boeing also said that the titanium issue was \"industry-wide\", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers.  It said tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.  The company said it sourced the metal separately from its supplier and it believed a small number of parts had been affected. \"To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,\u201d  the company said.  The New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion.  Spirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000  tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production. \"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium,\" spokesman Joe Buccino said. \"The problem is we've lost traceability.\" The FAA said Boeing had issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records and that it was probing the scope of the issue. Canadian transportation safety officials said in a separate statement that they were working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue, and that officials \"will not hesitate to take action\". The so-called Dutch roll, said to have been named after an ice-skating technique attributed to the Netherlands, occurred on a 25 May flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California.  The FAA said the aircraft regained control and no-one on board was injured, but the plane suffered \"substantial\" damage.  A post-flight inspection of the two-year-old plane revealed significant damage to a unit that provides backup power to the rudder.  \"Dutch roll can be unpleasant but the 737 exhibits relatively benign characteristics.  The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing,\" said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant. Safety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing.  An incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing.  Boeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues.  Theo Leggett contributed to this article.

The account, GenZBloomer, is one of dozens across X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok which the BBC has identified as posting hundreds of repeated messages in comment threads expressing support for Reform UK. Their behaviour has prompted claims from other social media users that they are fake - automated \"bot\" accounts - and they are distorting the online conversation to try to exaggerate the popularity of Reform UK. The BBC contacted people behind the accounts and found that some are genuine UK voters who believe they are helping the party through their own initiative. Others, however, failed to prove they were authentic. I spotted this pattern of comments in posts recommended to the feeds of our Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people based around the UK with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content. This video can not be played Marianna Spring: Why am I tracking 24 phones this election? \"The main purpose of my account at this time is to restore British culture and values,\" the GenZbloomer account told me in a message. Following concerns about foreign interference in previous elections, some social media users have suggested that GenZbloomer - and other similar accounts - may not be based in the UK. They have pointed out phrases a native speaker would be unlikely to use, such as \"make an article\" instead of \"write an article\" and \"neighbourhood tavern\" instead of \"local pub\". Others are convinced the GenZbloomer profile must be parody - particularly referring to a blog post the account shared on X about how \"young men are struggling out here to find traditional British women to date\" because women think they are \"better than everyone else because of Love Island and Starmer\", referring to the Labour leader Sir Keir. The person who claimed to be behind GenZbloomer told me they were based in \"the Annesley England area\" - an unusual way to describe the small village in Nottinghamshire  - and gave me a UK mobile phone number. They agreed to speak to me on the phone, but then did not answer any of my calls. GenZBloomer has posted hundreds of times about Reform UK on X On WhatsApp, their account is labelled as a business account for a \"consulting agency\", and features a profile image of a faceless cartoon figure with a microphone headset on. In messages with grammatical mistakes, they claimed to be a \"generation Z voter\" who wants a \"proper Brexit but the conservatives party ruined\". The account claimed to be working \"with Reform UK\" in order to \"help them win and spread their values across the UK\". The person who had been messaging me provided no evidence to support this claim - and a Reform UK spokesperson said this profile was not connected to the party at all. Reform UK told the BBC it had been in touch with social media companies about other accounts falsely purporting to be connected with the party. Some responses to my messages from GenZbloomer sounded like parody - describing how they would have to speak to a Reform Party county organiser before they spoke to me, but adding that it \"should not be an issue Reform has a super lax vetting process\". After a back-and-forth over text message, my phone number then appeared to have been blocked. Since this article was first published, the GenZbloomer account has been suspended by X for violating its rules. Some social media users have claimed comments in support of Reform UK are being posted by bots Social media users now seem more likely to accuse other accounts of being bots - alleging they undermine trust and disrupt the online debate, even when some of these profiles turn out to be genuine. In the past decade, there have been documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to sow division and promote particular points of view during Western elections. They have used networks of what social media firms call \"inauthentic accounts\" and what users call bots or \"troll farms\". Whether the actions of these accounts changed anyone\u2019s mind is unclear. In recent weeks, Reform UK has seen a genuine rise in the polls - which may partly explain its growing role in the online conversation. A spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"We are, of course, delighted about the organic growth of online support, but with that come some accounts that are not formally associated with the party, but actively subvert and lie about who we are.\" The spokesman said some people wrongly believe the only way others could end up supporting Reform UK was if they had been fooled in some way by the internet. In total, I found more than 50 profiles that had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts, posting in support of Reform UK across the different social media sites - although they could still have been genuine. These hallmarks can include a username and profile picture with no identifying features, no followers or seemingly real friends - and engaging entirely with political or divisive content, or reposting the same repetitive phrases. The BBC's Undercover Voter profiles in Bridgend were pushed content which included the alleged bot comments Some had no posts of their own. Others, seemingly based outside the UK,  previously posted about US politics and sports or animal cruelty before switching to Reform UK. Several had also shared conspiracy theory content about Covid-19 or posts opposing Ukraine and supporting Russia. I have not found other accounts posting about other political parties in the same way - or being met with the same accusations. Many of these accounts did not respond when I contacted them. But one called username341317847855 did. He said his name was Martin and he agreed to speak to me on the phone from the quiet of his van in London. \"Of course I'm a real person. I'm just fed up with the government. I'm fed up with MPs,\" he said. He made light of the bot claims, joking that I could call him \"Martin the Bot\" and telling me he was not worried that these accusations might undermine Reform UK\u2019s social media posts. Martin said no political parties or users have encouraged him to post. He said he decided to vote for the first time in this election. This account had some of the hallmarks of a bot, but the BBC traced it to a first-time voter named Martin in London Several more of these accounts told me they were real people based in the UK, who were just sharing their political views. Some shared evidence with me to demonstrate this. One account run by someone called Matt said: \"I can assure you I'm not a bot. I'm politically homeless.\" He said he was from Bury, was aged 46 and a welder by trade. He does not have any profile picture or posts on his TikTok account, only comments on the videos of others. He told me that no political party or anyone else had instructed him to comment in support of Reform UK. Matt said that when he saw the other profiles posting these comments similar to his on social media, it helped him and others realise \"they are not the only ones who feel this way and have these views\". What Matt\u2019s experience seems to show is that comments that boost the perceived support for a political party - whether they come from UK voters or inauthentic accounts - can embolden more real people to join in. It is one more piece of evidence in this election that suggests individual social media users and anonymous accounts have the ability to shape the online conversation just as effectively as the content coming from the political parties themselves. A TikTok spokesperson has previously told the BBC it has introduced \"more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference\". \"Creating fake accounts or engaging in inauthentic activities goes against Meta's policies\", a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC. X, formerly Twitter, said they \"remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation\". Two of the three Bridgend Undercover Voters were recommended content linked to the Reform UK bot claims The Undercover Voters are fictional profiles designed to represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK. They follow, view and like content relevant to their character, informed by data and analysis from the National Centre for Social Research. For this story, I examined the feeds of the profiles of some of these fictional voters in the constituency of Bridgend in Wales, which is currently held by the Conservatives and is a Labour target. Gavin - a right-leaning voter in his 60s who has a strong interest in politics - has had content about Reform UK actively recommended to him across his social media feeds, including material with the alleged bot posts in the comments. On the other hand, 72-year-old Eluned - a left-leaning Welsh Nationalist who is very supportive of the European Union - has been pushed several posts and comments from people concerned that these profiles supporting Reform are bots.

Kelly and band-mate Frances McKee were in college when they formed The Vaselines in 1987. \"We lasted two-and-a-half years and released two singles and an album. That was it,\" says Kelly. \"It was fun. We didn't take it seriously, though we were serious about the song-writing.\" He adds: \"We knew we didn't have a chance to be a big band.  \"No big record labels were interested and we weren't getting into the charts or on Top of the Pops.\"  The Vaselines will play at this summer's Belladrum music festival  The Vaselines broke up in 1989. McKee was a primary school teacher for a while and formed bands Painkillers and then Suckle. The latter released an album. Kelly worked in a bar and formed Captain America, before later changing the name to Eugenius.  The band, which featured members of BMX Bandits and Teenage Fanclub, released two albums and opened European dates for Nirvana. Kelly and McKee also released solo albums. But in the early 1990s, millions of music fans became aware of the songs they wrote as The Vaselines. Nirvana had exploded on to the world music scene.  The US band, whose hits included Smells Like Teen Spirit, would go on to sell more than 75 million records. Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain was a huge Vaselines fan. Nirvana were one of the biggest bands of the 1990s Nirvana performed and recorded three Vaselines songs: Molly's Lips, Son of A Gun and Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam - which Cobain also performed live on MTV. With Cobain's encouragement, The Vaselines reformed briefly for a 1990 Nirvana gig in Edinburgh. Kelly also sang Molly's Lips with Cobain at 1991's Reading Festival. Nirvana recorded some of the most memorable songs of the 1990s, including Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lithium. Cobain took his own life in 1994. The rest of Nirvana would later go on to pursue their own music interests. Dave Grohl, the band's drummer, is heading for Glasgow's Hampden stadium next week with his band the Foo Fighters. Kelly, right, sings with Cobain at 1991's Reading Festival Kelly says he knows mention of Nirvana is likely to come up in interviews at some point, often in a question \"sneaked in\" at the end. But he says: \"There is no downside to a band like Nirvana recording your songs, and we're happy to talk about it because we are really grateful that it happened. \"I think we would pretty much be a forgotten band.  \"Not even a one-hit - a no-hit wonder.\" The Vaselines reformed in 2008 and began recording new music. The connection to Nirvana has helped ensure an audience, but Kelly says huge challenges remain for the band and other musicians trying to make a living in the industry.  \"It is tough for bands that are not super famous,\" he says. \"The music industry doesn't seem to support upcoming, interesting, odd ball kind of music. \"We've always been lo-fi and definitely see ourselves as part-timers and outsiders.\" He adds: \"Brexit has made it so much more expensive to play somewhere like France, Spain or Germany. \"We can't really afford to go to America, which we love playing, because visa costs are so expensive.\" But Kelly goes on: \"I love playing the shows, I love playing and singing live.  \"It is great to be able to do it.\" Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly first formed The Vaselines in the late 1980s This year The Vaselines are to perform in Dunfermline, Galashiels, Glasgow, Dunbar and next month's Belladrum music festival near Inverness. The other musicians in the band are Michael McGaughrin on drums, Graeme Smillie in bass and Carla Easton on keyboards. Kelly says: \"We are always interested in playing new places and a festival is great because you play to a bigger crowd and also get the chance to make some new fans.\" Looking back to when The Vaselines split, he says: \"To be doing it now over 30 years later is just bizarre. \"The shows have started to sell out.\" He jokes: \"We have been on a slow upward trajectory.\" Kelly adds they hope to write some new songs. \"You heard it here first,\" he says. \"It might or might not work out, but we are definitely thinking about it.\" Putin peace terms slammed at Ukraine summit Kate returns to public events at Trooping the Colour What does Nigel Farage really want?

The airlifts of seven Przewalski's Horses from Europe to the Central Asian country took place in early June in an operation run by Prague Zoo. Researchers told the BBC that the horses are already doing well two weeks in: roaming around the plains and even beginning the mating process. Zoo officials say it's a triumph of generations of conservation work. \"This is an endangered species returning to their ancestral lands, a species which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, last seen in Mongolia...so it's just marvellous... a miracle,\" said Filip Ma\u0161ek, a spokesman for Prague Zoo. While the horses have been slowly reintroduced to Mongolia and China in recent decades, this operation marks the first time they are back in Kazakhstan. The Przewalski's Horse is the last wild horse species on the planet, named after Russian explorer Nikolai Przewalski who was the first to identify the horse for the European science community. The species originated millennia ago from the steppes of Central Asia and was taken by researchers to Europe and North America in the 19th and 20th Centuries, where populations were established in zoos. Some of them ended up in zoos in Munich and Prague - it's their descendants that have now been reintroduced in Kazakhstan. Cultural artefacts show people in the country's north were riding and using the horses for food at least 2,000 years before records of domesticated horses in Europe. But by the time of Przewalski's \"discovery\" in 1879, the horses could only be found in a small section of western Mongolia. Competition with humans and livestock, along with changes in the environment led to them dying out. Recognising the threat, international efforts were made after World War Two to save the animals. Prague Zoo was entrusted with the \"international studship\" of the breed. It introduced the first contingent back into Kazakhstan  last week- a group consisting of one stallion and six mares. It aims to bring in at least 40 more over the next five years. \"This is an event of historical import,\" said the zoo's director Miroslav Bobek in a statement. \"The seven horses that we transported here by two Czech Army planes represent the first individuals of this species in central Kazakhstan in hundreds of years.\" A Przewalski's horse being released in Mongolia in 2017 Przewalski's horse has long been considered the one true remaining wild horse species- as species such as the American mustang and Australian brumby are feral horses descended from domesticated animals. The Przewalski's horse is shorter and stockier than modern domesticated horses and their genetic differences show that neither species are ancestors of the other. Prague Zoo, which has spent the past decade and a half introducing the horses back to Central Asia, mainly in Mongolia, said the Kazakhstan operations had been in the plans since 2022 after signing a deal with the local government.  Last week saw the culmination of years of work. Prague Zoo selected horses from different programmes around Europe and put them together in the same zoo in Berlin - Tierpark Berlin - for several months to become acquainted before their journey. That then kicked off in early June, with military aeroplanes flying the standing horses in two groups on a 6,000km-route that included stopovers in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Once they touched ground at the Arkalyk Airport in Kazakhstan, they were taken on an eight-hour drive to the plains where they were then finally released onto the Altyn Dala - the Kazakh name for the Golden Steppe. \u201c[The mare named] Tessa was the first to run out of the transport box into the pen, then Wespe, followed by Umbra, and Sary brought the foursome to a close,\" Mr Bobek said. On Thursday,  zoo spokesman Mr Ma\u0161ek told the BBC that the horses, after some initial trepidation, had begun to venture further afield. In a \"very good\" development, scientists this week also reported that some of the horses had begun to mate.  The group has been moved in early summer so they have time to adapt before winter, which is typically brutal on the plains. They will be kept to a 60 hectare \"acclimatisation\" pen for the first year before being released into the wider grasslands. Mr Ma\u0161ek said the zoo hoped to emulate the success of its Mongolia programme last decade - where the introduction of 34 horses had helped boost the native population to now well over 850 animals. Researchers are optimistic and hopeful, he said. He noted while human activity wasn't the sole reason for the horse's extinction, actions like hunting and breeding the species with domesticated horses accelerated their disappearance. \"We are still responsible the fact this wild horse disappeared and now we can sort of reverse that, and give it back to nature.\" He described it as the ultimate goal of a modern zoo: \"To sort of be these Noah's Arks which have all these endangered species. \"If it's possible- and sometimes it's not - we should try and do everything to return them to their original environments.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Iain Meiklejohn has been part of the Tartan Army for 30 years and said he did not want his 12-year-old son Aleks to miss Scotland playing in important matches.  Iain said he was unconcerned about his son missing school lessons and was certain he would have plenty of time to make up for it.  Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Iain said: \"Aleks will learn more in a couple of weeks out traveling than he will in school, coming towards the end of term when everything starts to wind down anyway.\" Iain and Aleks will follow the Scotland football team through Germany over the course of the 2024 Euro Championships. After staying in Frankfurt for one night they will travel to Munich to watch the first game of the group stages when Scotland take on Germany.  They will then move onto Cologne and Stuttgart where they will watch Scotland play Switzerland and Hungary. If Scotland manage to get through the group stages, Iain has prepared by taking enough time off work and letting Aleks' school know that he will be back when Scotland are knocked out. He sent an email to his son's school that said: \"We will be going on an educational trip through Germany visiting several cities where we will study the extreme emotional highs and lows that only a Scotland fan goes through. \"I will ensure Aleks completes a report on his return in full detail. M\u2019on Scotland!\" Aleks has travelled to 24 countries  Iain, 48, said Aleks' mum is Polish so they support Poland when Scotland don't make it to the big tournaments. \"But Scotland have made it this time,\" he said. \"It's all about Scotland.\" When Aleks grows up, Iain said he plans on seeing the world and becoming a pilot. His dad said he was not concerned about any repercussions from the council or school authorities over his son's absence. He has previously taken Aleks to many football events during term time such as the World Cups in Russia and Brazil and the last European Championships. A City of Edinburgh Council spokesperson said: \"Any unauthorised absence would be dealt with in line with the council\u2019s policy on this.\u201d  Iain said: \"This is his fifth international trip, and we've never had any feedback, negative reports, emails, or letters.

Fans took the singer's encouragement to Shake It Off literally, with monitoring stations detecting seismic activity from 6km (3.73 miles) away. The energetic Swifties made the biggest commotion during three songs: Cruel Summer, Ready For It? and Champagne Problems. And it seems the 73,000-strong Friday night crowd danced, cheered and stomped the loudest of the three gigs. It marked the first of 17 UK dates for Swift, which will culminate in a record-breaking eight-night run at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Thousands of Swifties made 'unbelievable impact' on Edinburgh How 'Swiftonomics' is impacting the music industry The 152-date stadium tour is on track to make more than $2bn (\u00a31.56bn) by the time it wraps up in December, making it the most lucrative concert tour in music history. During her three Murrayfield performances, Swift played to 200,000 fans who came from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show. The Friday night concert was the most energetic by a small margin with fans making the ground move a maximum of 23.4 nanometres (nm), compared to 22.8nm and 23.3nm on the Saturday and Sunday respectively. The seismic activity was mainly caused by dancing and reached its peak at 160bpm during Ready For It? The Swifties created approximately 80kW of power during the song. Shake It Off and Cruel Summer made the ground move, but detectors even shook during a four-minute long applause for Champagne Problems. Swift's previous tour dates in Seattle and Los Angeles registered similar events, with her Seattle gig generating activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. Fans travelled to Edinburgh from all over the world to see the 14-time Grammy winner The British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK's national earthquake monitoring agency and its detectors are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest seismic activity miles away. Callum Harrison, BGS seismologist, said: \"It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve been able to measure the reaction of thousands of concert goers remotely through our data.  \"The opportunity to explore a seismic activity created by a different kind of phenomenon has been a thrill. \"Clearly Scotland\u2019s reputation for providing some of the most enthusiastic audiences remains well intact!\" The movement was detected at two monitoring stations, the furthest of which was 6km (three and a half miles) away, at the BGS office at Heriot Watt University. However experts said the movement generated by the concert was unlikely to have been felt by anyone other than those in the immediate vicinity. Ready for it?

This will be her first public appearance this year following the diagnosis, and her abdominal surgery in January.  But in a personal message, Catherine says her treatment is still ongoing and will continue for another few months. \"I am not out of the woods yet,\" says the princess. This is the most significant update on Catherine's health since revealing in March she had cancer, in a statement written in her own words. It is accompanied by a new photograph of the princess, taken by photographer Matt Porteous, which shows her near her home in Windsor. But there is caution with the positive message. \u201cAs anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\u201d she says. \"On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,\" says the princess. \"I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty.

For Trooping the Colour, the princess will be in the carriage parade with her children and will be part of the family group waving from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

He made a number of striking statistical claims on a host of subjects. Here we examine some of them. He did not specify what statistical source this was based on and this claim needs context.  Annual net migration - the difference between people coming to the UK and leaving - in the year to December 2023 was 685,000. Assuming the population increase due to net migration occurred evenly through the year, this would amount to 2.6 people every two minutes. The average UK household occupancy in 2023 was about 2.4 people, according to the Office for National Statistics. So if every new member of the UK population due to net migration last year ended up in a household of 2.4 people and that household required a new home to live in, you could get to a statistic similar to that cited by Mr Farage. However, this kind of calculation does not take into account some existing homes being vacant, or how many people, on average, live in a household formed by new migrants. Moreover, analysts say the interaction of immigration and housing demand is complex - and the main impact is likely to be through house prices and rents. The government\u2019s Migration Advisory Committee, its official advisory body, found evidence in 2018 that a 1% population increase due to migration leads to a 1% rise in house prices. But the Migration Observatory concluded more recently that \u201cit is challenging to establish a causal relationship between the price of housing and the level of immigration with any precision\u201d. Seven-party BBC election debate fact-checked Taxes, NHS waiting lists and small boats - BBC Verify tests key claims This claim is not correct if you look at the latest figures for overall migrant visas.  Mr Farage did not specify which time period he was talking about but in the year ending March 2024, about a third of all visas issued went to dependants. His claim is broadly correct though on the numbers coming on work visas. Out of all the work visas issued in the year ending March 2024, 48% were issued to dependants. However, it is worth noting that dependants of a person on a skilled worker visa or a student visa are not entitled to claim benefits in the UK. And they are allowed to work - although we don\u2019t know what proportion do so. The UK actually has \u201clow levels of proven electoral fraud\u201d, according to the Electoral Commission, an independent body tasked by Parliament with overseeing UK elections.  Its data shows that of the 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, 11 led to convictions and the police issued four cautions. Of the five convictions for electoral fraud in elections held in 2019, one of them involved postal ballots. This claim is misleading.  Scientists at Nasa told Reuters in March that human activity has been responsible for around 33% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.  The natural world recycles hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 every year. But what really matters for the climate is how CO2 levels change over time. Without human influence, the amount of CO2 produced would roughly equal the amount absorbed - meaning the level of CO2 in the atmosphere would stay roughly the same.  But since 1750, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 50%. It is at its highest level for two million years. The UN\u2019s climate body - the IPCC - produces comprehensive reports on the state of knowledge about global warming, drawing on the work of the world's scientists. The IPCC concluded in its 2023 report that \u201chuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming\u201d. It is difficult to come to a verdict on this claim because there is no breakdown of shoplifting prosecutions, by value of goods stolen.  Under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, there are different rules for prosecuting \u201clow-value shoplifting\u201d, defined as theft from a shop of goods valued at under \u00a3200. The maximum sentence for this is six months in prison, but the offence can be dealt with by issuing a fine (which would count as a prosecution).  There has been a large increase in shoplifting in recent years. According to the Office for National Statistics, in the year ending December 2023 the number of recorded shoplifting offences increased by over a third in England and Wales compared with the previous year. There were 430,000 offences in 2023 compared with 315,000 in 2022. In 2023, more than 31,000 people were prosecuted in England and Wales for theft from shops but these figures do not specify the value of goods stolen.

One of the cars almost ended up Holly Johnson's front room, after the crash triggered a series of collisions The incident occured when a white Audi crashed into a stationary car triggering a domino effect, and leading to six stationary cars on the residential street being damaged by the impact. Four of them are believed to have been written-off.  Resident Holly Johnson told the BBC: \"We woke to the sound of crashing, and car alarms going off. \"It was like a nightmare.  \"The Audi zoomed straight into a Citroen - then six cars in total were involved.  \"Someone from the Audi was injured - I could hear a lad screaming.\" It is understood the man's injuries are not serious.  Ms Johnson, 24, said: \"The cars all bounced along the road and one nearly came straight into my front room,  \"A gas pipe was also damaged - that could have led to a major gas leak and the house could have gone up in flames.\" A West Yorkshire Police spokesperson confirmed officers on patrol came across a multi-vehicle collision on Ford Hill. Ms Johnson, a teaching assistant, added: \"We're all so shaken up.  \"You just want to feel safe in your own house.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

The first sign that something was amiss was when Marble, an executive producer for a streaming series, started having issues with his mobile phone. He couldn\u2019t connect to email, or send a text. It wasn\u2019t until later that night when he got back to his hotel room, logged into the wifi and investigated further that his worst fears were realized. His crypto wallet had been drained. \u201cI'd lost $100,000 of cryptocurrency instantaneously,\u201d he said. \u201cI just remember thinking, \u2018This can't be real.\u2019\u201d Marble called his wife in a panic, feeling a sense of hopelessness and shame as he explained what had happened. The money was gone, he could see it had been transferred into other people\u2019s wallets, but he couldn\u2019t tell who those wallets belonged to, because the whole point of cryptocurrency was its anonymity. \u201cI just remember having this sinking feeling in my heart. I felt guilty, I felt ashamed, I felt naive, and I felt embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I wondered, \u2018What's gonna happen next?\u2019 Who do you call when you get hacked for cryptocurrency?\u201d Marble didn\u2019t know it yet, but he was the victim of a new and growing form of cyber crime called \u201csim swapping,\u201d that\u2019s been linked to huge crypto heists in which millions of dollars have been stolen. Chart the rise and fall of Joel Ortiz in our brand new documentary \u2013\u00a0The Crypto Bandit: The technique involves a hacker tricking or bribing a cellphone carrier employee to redirect the victim's phone number to a different phone, giving the hacker access to all their calls and messages, allowing them to reset their passwords and, ultimately, empty their accounts. The hacker holding the phone that was used to steal Marble\u2019s crypto was Joel Ortiz: an 18-year-old college student who, from his mother\u2019s Boston apartment, would go on to steal more than $7.5 million in this way. Ortiz, an isolated teen whose only social connections were online, would go on to splurge large amounts of the money he stole from high-value crypto investors on a lavish luxury lifestyle, a world removed from his modest upbringing as the son of a disabled, immigrant solo mother. The story of Ortiz\u2019s remarkable crime wave, and the team of investigators who would eventually bring him to justice, is told in The Crypto Bandit \u2013\u00a0a new documentary in VICE\u2019s Cowboy Kings of Crypto series. \u201cOrtiz was a brainy guy,\u201d said Erin West, deputy district attorney in Santa Clara County, California, where Ortiz would eventually be charged, becoming the first person sentenced for \u201csim swap\u201d offending in the US. \u201cHe graduated as valedictorian of his class and got a scholarship to UMass. And we know that he had skills that were really usable in this way. He exploited a vulnerability that I don't think the rest of the nation was really thinking much about.\u201d Known online by the handle @0, Ortiz operated as part of a hacker ring, working with online associates to pull off his audacious crimes. Investigators say he and others in the gang targeted individuals publicly associated with the crypto world, drawing up lists of rich potential targets in the hope of catching a \u201cwhale.\u201d With one victim in particular, Ortiz and his fellow hackers would hit the jackpot. Saswata Basu is a Silicon Valley-based founder of a company that raised capital from the crypto market, who would also find himself a victim of Ortiz\u2019s scams. Like Marble, he would discover he was being hacked when his phone started displaying messages about his passwords being changed. But the scale of the theft from Basu would dwarf Marble\u2019s losses. \u201cThere was one wallet... which was hacked,\u201d he told VICE. \u201cThe amount was about $5 million.\u201d Ortiz flaunted his new wealth on social media: buying Gucci outfits and designer goods, and renting luxury mansions in Los Angeles to party in. \u201cIf you're an 18-year-old kid and you just stole $5 million, what would you do with that money?\u201d said Samy Tarazi, a criminal investigator in the Santa Clara district attorney\u2019s office. Tarazi was a member of REACT, an elite taskforce that had been formed in California to tackle this kind of cybercrime. \u201cThe answer is always something dumb. He had traveled from Boston to Hollywood and had rented out Airbnbs.\u201d Ortiz\u2019s habit of posting his wild lifestyle on social media would only help investigators, and he was eventually arrested at LAX airport, as he prepared to board a flight to Europe. In April 2019, he was given a 10-year sentence after pleading no contest to eight counts of identity theft and computer crimes. He is currently serving his sentence at Centinela Prison in California, and is due to be released in 2028. But the bulk of the stolen millions in crypto remains unaccounted for, having been laundered by his gang in a process that makes the funds virtually untraceable. Tarazi and West said that, when arrested, Ortiz showed them about $250,000 in cryptocurrency, and had probably blown about the same amount in his excessive spending. \u201cThere was a huge gap between what he could account for and what we knew he took,\u201d said West. For Marble, there was an unexpected silver lining. Long after the theft, he received an unexpected email from the High Court in Ireland, informing him that one of Ortiz\u2019s co-conspirators\u2013a Dublin-based hacker named Conor Freeman\u2013had been arrested, and the money that had been stolen from him recovered. Freeman was sentenced in November 2020 to two years and 11 months in prison. \u201cIt was another, just surreal moment,\u201d said Marble, who was returned $90,000 of the stolen crypto. \u201cI was basically made whole right there.\u201d But most victims weren\u2019t so lucky. The whereabouts of millions of dollars stolen by the hacker gang remained a mystery, said Tarazi. \u201cWe don't know if they gave it to trusted third parties we haven't identified, [or] they have it buried in a forest somewhere and they'll get it when they get out of prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't know.\u201d"},{"author":"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper","title":"The Pioneering Cyber Detective Who Cracked a 30-Year-Old Cold Case","url":"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/jg59dk\/tent-girl-cold-case-cyber-detective-todd-matthews","description":"In the 1990s, Todd Matthews used the internet to help solve the \u201cTent Girl\u201d mystery, one of the first cases of its kind.","date":"2024-06-13T18:15:57Z","content":"Todd Matthews was one of the first \u201ccyber detectives.\u201d An amateur sleuth who used the internet to solve the decades-old Tent Girl mystery, he later launched the Doe Network, a nonprofit that works with law enforcement to solve missing persons cases. A few years ago, VICE interviewed Matthews about his work in the 1990s, which inspired thousands of amateur detectives to go online to investigate missing-person cases and unsolved crimes worldwide.\u00a0 Matthews was only 17 when he started his first case, seeking the identity of \u201cTent Girl,\u201d a young woman who\u2019d been found dead wrapped in a canvas sheet. \u201cI first heard of the story \u2018The Tent Girl\u2019 in 1987,\u201d he said, noting that his future wife had just moved to Tennessee from Kentucky. \u201cIt was near Halloween, so we were telling ghost stories. She explained how her father had found a body on the side of the road wrapped in a canvas tent wrapper and how a grave had been created with her image on it.\u201d \u201cNo name,\u201d he continued. \u201cJust \u2018Tent Girl.\u2019 That just stuck with me.\u201d Matthews\u2019s brother and sister had passed away when they were infants\u2014no stranger to tragic loss, he felt \u2018Tent Girl\u2019 deserved to be identified. \u201cI think it was really obsessive right from the get-go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process of trying to find out who she was immediately began.\u201d From there, he scoured newspaper and magazine articles to discover any sliver of information that might help him further the case.\u00a0 \u201cSome of the biggest obstacles in the story were getting information,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was hard copy.\u201d Back then, much of the research had to be done in person: visiting Tent Girl\u2019s grave, picking up hard copies of articles, and interviewing sources\u2014including his father-in-law, who remembered things differently than the news articles. \u201cThe newspaper described her as pretty much a child, but he said he actually saw her, and he felt that she was possibly older,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cSo there were some data conflicts immediately.\u201d \u201cIt was more than an obsession. It felt like an obligation.\u201d \u2013Todd Matthews Matthews told VICE that the story became so haunting that he even experienced vivid dreams of the missing woman. Though he began researching this case when he was only a teenager, his dedication to solving the mystery persevered for several years. \u201cBy this point in time, it was having an effect on my marriage,\u201d he said. \u201cRacking up telephone bills that were difficult to pay. Arguments that were difficult to win. Rationalizing doing this with no results. \u201cAt what point do you say \u2018enough\u2019s enough\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was more than an obsession. It felt like an obligation.\u201d He heard of the internet around the mid-90s and recognized it as a tool. In 1997, he created a website, which you can still visit on the Internet Archive, including all the information he\u2019d collected about her and her case over the last decade. Because he had a family at this time, he did most of his research at night while everyone was asleep, explaining that he \u201csnuck off to my little office.\u201d Eventually, while searching \u201cmissing sister, missing this, missing that,\u201d he found several databases\u2014one relevant to the case. \u201cI did find a note where a lady in Arkansas was looking for her missing sister, last known to be in Lexington, Kentucky\u2014a very short distance away\u2014in December of 1967,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very clear at the time that that\u2019s who I was looking for.\u201d The Tent Girl ended up being Barbara Hackmann Taylor. She had remained unidentified for nearly 30 years after her body was found. However, thanks to Matthews, her family and loved ones were able to gain some closure. \u201cAfter the resolution of the Tent Girl case, the cybercommunity lit up,\u201d Matthews told VICE in the documentary. \u201cI heard from missing persons advocates from all over the world, and I helped in the development of the first database for missing and unidentified persons.\u201d Through his nonprofit, Matthews and other volunteer internet sleuths worked with law enforcement to reach resolutions and connect missing persons cases with John\/Jane Doe cases. \u201cI was blinded by trying to find what I needed that I didn\u2019t realize that some foundational work was being done,\u201d Matthews revealed. \u201cThat time I spent wasn\u2019t just time wasted. There was success in what I was trying to do, and in fact, it left a footprint. It repurposed the use of the internet.\u201d\u00a0 Matthews passed away earlier this year at the young age of 53. However, his contributions to the cyber detective community will live on forever."},{"author":"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper","title":"Thousands of Suspected Gang Members Moved to El Salvador\u2019s \u2018Mega Prison\u2019","url":"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/3akwpj\/thousands-of-suspected-gang-members-moved-to-el-salvadors-mega-prison","description":"President Bukele\u2019s anti-gang state of emergency has entered its second year.","date":"2024-06-13T18:07:56Z","content":"El Salvador\u2019s press office recently released a video showing the transfer of over 2,000 suspected gang members to a maximum-security prison. The inmates, who were accused of alleged involvement in gangs in El Salvador, were moved to the CECOT mega-prison (the Spanish acronym for the Counter-Terrorism Confinement Center) in Tecoluca. The country has been under an anti-gang emergency decree for over two years. The original state of emergency began in March of 2022 after a major spike in gang violence, which left 62 individuals dead in just one day.\u00a0 As of April 2024, nearly 80,000 people have been arrested for presumed gang affiliations. According to many rights groups, these sweeps have been arbitrary, with suspects arrested due to location and appearance alone. In fact, many have been released due to a lack of evidence. Their conditions in prison have been heavily criticized, with one group claiming that dozens of inmates have died in prison as a result of torture. Since President Nayib Bukele began his crackdown on gang activity, El Salvador reportedly has a homicide rate of only 2.4 per 100,000 people\u2014an extreme decline from 8 years ago, when it was 103 per 100,000. Today, El Salvador has the lowest homicide rate in Latin America, with a rate notably lower than the United States. As the transports of the inmates began over a year ago, Gustavo Villatoro, the government\u2019s minister for justice and peace, stated that the arrested suspects \u201care never going to return to the communities, the neighborhoods, the barrios, the cities of our beloved El Salvador.\u201d In the new video, the inmates were cuffed at their hands and feet, wearing nothing but white cotton shorts as authorities loaded them onto buses to transfer them to the new mega-prison. Many are concerned about the risk of human rights violations there. According to a recent report by Amnesty International, \u201cAmong the gravest consequences [of the anti-gang policy] are deaths in state custody. Many others are the result of inhumane conditions of imprisonment or denial of medical care and medicine.\u201d"},{"author":"Sammi Caramela, Duncan Cooper","title":"Why Did America Abandon Route 66?","url":"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/z3m7y9\/route-66-road-trip-abandoned","description":"A road trip down its iconic path to the West Coast to see what\u2019s left.","date":"2024-06-14T18:59:08Z","content":"Established in 1926, Route 66 was a highway that connected Chicago to Los Angeles, spanning nearly 2,500 miles across eight states. Once known as \u201cthe Mother Road,\u201d its iconic path to the coast was eventually replaced by newer highways, and it was officially decommissioned in the 1980s.\u00a0 Still, portions of the original Route 66 exist today, hanging onto that old spirit of the open road. In 2016, for VICE TV\u2019s Abandoned, skateboarders Rick McCrank and Frank Gerwer road-tripped it as best as they could, starting in California and stopping in each state Route 66 passed through.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re gonna start this story at the end,\u201d Rick said. \u201cThe end of the road\u201d\u2014California\u2019s Santa Monica Pier.\u00a0 Before heading out, he spoke with Ian Bowen, owner of a Route 66 gift shop on the pier.\u00a0 \u201c[Route 66] is the part of old-fashioned America that should be preserved,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThe culture, the conversation, the way people care. The way the old road was built, it went right through the main street of every town. It\u2019s why it\u2019s known as the \u2018Main Street of America.\u2019\u201d In the 1950s, new interstates offered quicker travel, with few exits connecting to Route 66. As major highways began to attract all the traffic, Mother Road lost most of its business. And though Route 66 was was included in the National Register of Historic Places after it was decommissioned, as Rick and Frank learned, some of the route\u2019s historic attractions aren\u2019t so, well, attractive.\u00a0 In Arizona, the Apache Skate Crew showed the duo their least favorite roadside stops in the ghost town of Twin Arrows. \u201cRoute 66 just cut right through the middle of the Navajo Reservation up here in northern Arizona,\u201d said Apache Skateboards\u2019s Douglas Miles.\u00a0 He pointed out several landmarks in the area. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of cheesy, stereotypical, weird, semi-racist-looking kind of structures here now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why these places are falling apart too, in a way, because I think people over time realized this place is whack.\" \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed what the American people who came here have done to the Native Americans,\u201d Frank admitted. \u201cI felt embarrassed for the white man, basically, for fucking blowing it for all those years \u2026 I felt guilty.\u201d The Apache Skate Crew thanked the two for their acknowledgment of the issue and willingness to call it out. \u201cNot a lot of people would have the guts to say that,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe respect that.\u201d As Rick and Frank continued down the Mother Road, they found some lingering signs of life\u2014including one of the lat remaining motels on a stretch in New Mexico. Built in 1939, the Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari was still well-maintained and bustling with guests during the summer months. \u201cWe have people almost banging down the door [during the summer],\u201d said Cameron Mueller, motel manager. \u201cWe have people from all over the world.\u201d \u201cRoute 66 is definitely thriving in some ways,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who want to experience what America was like before cellphones and tablets and computers. They want to see Americana. They don\u2019t want to just look at it on a computer screen. This is the best way to do it: a trip down the Mother Road.\u201d While certain parts of Route 66 were still alive and semi-well, others were completely abandoned. Take Texola, Oklahoma, for instance. Located right near the border of Texas along Mother Road, the ghost town boasted a population of just 43 people in 2020. The only sort of movement in the area was a lone tumbleweed, and even that was slow-moving. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the mark of a good road trip: it ends before you want it to.\u201d Speaking of tumbleweed, the only business in Texola was called Tumbleweed Grill, which was then temporarily closed. Masel Zimmerman, the restaurant\u2019s owner, said she was attempting to maintain the town by purchasing any properties that were for sale and fixing them up.\u00a0 However, despite her attempt to revive the once-bustling town, she said, \u201cThe way that it was, it will never be like that again. Not here in this town. It will never be like that again.\u201d With access to far more convenient interstates today, not many people travel the Main Street of America anymore. However, those who do can enjoy a slower alternative to living\u2014and countless historical attractions, abandoned yet charming towns, and loyal communities.\u00a0 By the time Rick and Frank reached the end\u2014or, really, the beginning\u2014of Route 66 in Chicago, Illinois, they reflected on their travels with a newfound appreciation. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the mark of a good road trip: it ends before you want it to,\u201d Rick said. \u201cBecause even when you\u2019re driving down a dead highway full of ghost towns, rotten tourist traps, and tumbleweeds, even when you realize the nostalgia is bull\u2014, there\u2019s nothing like taking it slow with an old friend.\u201d"}]}

He says, \"Sulfates are so strong that they will completely fade the color you just paid all that money for at the salon.\" To help narrow your options, we've rounded up the best shampoos for color-treated hair for different hair types, colors, and price points.

Valdes, a colorist at Chicago's Maxine Salon, the K\u00e9rastase Chronologiste Shampoo for Dull and Brittle Hair \"brings volume and bounce back to brittle and dull hair.\" As such, explains the pro, this shampoo is an optimal pick for color-treated tresses. Meanwhile, ingredient highlights include hydrating hyaluronic acid and nourishing vitamin E. Combat damaged hair with Paul Mitchell's Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Lather Shampoo, which Taylor describes as ideal for dry, damaged, and color-treated tresses. \"It really rebuilds your hair,\" Taylor says. Its sulfate- and paraben-free formula\u2014which is spiked glycerin plus smoothing keratin, vitamin-loaded ginger root, and antioxidant-laden green tea\u2014even boasts a pleasant ginger tea scent. Every expert we spoke to agreed that the best shampoo for blondes are purple shampoos, which boast brassiness-banishing formulas. Devin Toth, a stylist at Salon SCK in New York City, loves Shu Uemura's Y\u016bbi Blonde Anti-Brass Purple Shampoo for its \"cool violet pigments that completely neutralize brassy tones in the hair.\" He continues, telling Insider, \"It also contains Japanese white peony, which soothes, softens, and moisturizes hair.\" According to Saviano, Mielle's Babassu Conditioning Shampoo is especially ideal for curly, color-treated hair. It also contains moisturizing Babassu oil, which Saviano credits with keeping \"dry and curly hair types hydrated, smooth and frizz-free.\" Plus, it's under $15.\u00a0 Valdes tells INSIDER that the Fable & Main HoliRoots Hydrating Shampoo is excellent for keratin support, making it a solid choice for folks with straight hair. Its gentle yet effective formula includes coconut and aloe to smooth and add shine to the hair and targets dry and flaky scalps that need extra hydration. Fine hair, do care. That's why Saviano recommends the Vegamour ENSO 01 Shampoo for its ultra-lightweight formula, which is \"free from toxic ingredients, phthalates, and silicones that cause hair to be limp and flat.\" As a bonus, this color-safe shampoo is enriched with hydration-boosting glycerin and vitamin-rich aloe. Ouai's Thick Hair Shampoo is Taylor's top pick for clients with a head full of hair. He tells Insider, \"I've noticed it easily cleans every strand of hair in one shampoo and is super hydrating.\" Additionally, it's enriched with beneficial ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, and avocado oil. If you have oily strands, consider incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your hair-care routine. Taylor recommends Oribe's The Cleanse Clarifying Shampoo, which should be used no more than once a week. Per the stylist, this shampoo \"uses skincare exfoliants and does away with dirt, oil, and product buildup without completely stripping your hair like most clarifying shampoos.\" According to Taylor, the best way to describe the blue-hued Redken's Color Extend Brownlightes Shampoo is as a purple shampoo but for brunettes. \"This sulfate-free shampoo tones and neutralizes brass in both natural and color-treated brunettes,\" Taylor says. The Oribe Shampoo for Beautiful Color is especially ideal for those with red hair thanks to its color-locking formula. \"I love that it provides a gentle cleanse without using sulfates,\" explains Valdes. Not only is this shampoo great for keratin-treated strands, but it's also loaded with glycerin\u2014-along with antioxidant-loaded rosemary leaf extract and fatty acid-rich sunflower extract. Not Your Mother's Smooth Moves Anti-Frizz Shampoo is Taylor's \"number one\" rec for those searching for a color-safe shampoo at the drugstore. Per the pro, this under-$10 staple is sulfate-, paraben-, and cruelty-free\u2014all while being \"gentle enough for color-treated hair\" and delivering \"amazing 72-hour frizz control.\" Hero ingredients include hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing macadamia oil.

Here's why it's an enduring team favorite.","date":"2024-06-14T15:41:44Z","content":"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more  Some of my favorite childhood memories involve one of the best KitchenAid stand mixers. When I moved into my first apartment, it was a right of passage to receive a KitchenAid mixer of my own: an older version of the KitchenAid Classic Plus 4.5 Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer handed down from my dad that lasted me for years. (If your family is loyal to another kitchen appliance brand, check out our picks for the best stand mixer to make your own baking memories.) Over the years, I encountered the KitchenAid Classic Plus again and again: in homes of my family members, as a cook in professional kitchens, and most recently as a product tester writing our guide to the best KitchenAid stand mixers. Through years and years of experience, I can confidently say it's one of the best gadgets you can buy for the money. \n                                      The least expensive model made by KitchenAid, the Classic Plus has all the quality components of more expensive mixers but it's compact, efficient, and powerful enough to accomplish most tasks for casual bakers.\n                                     Specifics Wattage conveys the power of the motor: the gist is that lower-wattage models have less powerful motors than higher-wattage models. KitchenAid stand mixers range from 250 to 970 watts, and the Classic Plus is on the lower end of that spectrum with a 275-watt motor. This is perfectly adequate for common tasks like making cookies, brownies, whipped cream, cake, and the occasional bread loaf.\u00a0 However, if you're someone who bakes every week or regularly makes really tough, stiff doughs, you'll want to choose a model with 400 watts or above. For our guide to the best KitchenAid stand mixers, I tested a new version of the KitchenAid Classic Plus and used it to mix cookie dough, whip egg whites, and knead hefty bagel dough. The mixer comes with three attachments for accomplishing each of these tasks: a paddle mixer, a whisk, and a dough hook.\u00a0 The stand mixer is super easy to operate and use. There are just two levers: one to lock the mixer head in place for safer operation, and one to adjust the speed. The lowest speed gently mixes in delicate ingredients (like chocolate chips for cookie dough) and the highest speed tackles tough tasks like kneading bread dough. For most uses, you won't need to go past speed 7 or so.\u00a0 Performance-wise, it excelled at mixing cookie dough and whipping egg whites, but struggled a bit through the bagel dough. While the dough ultimately came together fine, I wouldn't trust it with double batches and I'd probably limit these tough tasks to just a couple times a year for the longevity of the mixer. At 25 pounds, it's a hefty mixer. And while it's lighter than most other KitchenAid models, it's still a task to move it around. The mixer itself is made of enamel-coated metal, which is super durable and heavy. You can wipe the body down easily after use with a damp cloth. The mixing bowl is fairly light made of smooth metal that is very easy to clean. I usually just throw it in the dishwasher.\u00a0 Determine whether the wattage suits your needs. This isn't something you want to find out by experimenting; burning out the motor is a repairable issue, but one that will cost you (sometimes almost as much as a new stand mixer). I really would caution anyone who thinks they'll be using their stand mixer weekly or for lots of bread to choose a more powerful model from our guide to the best KitchenAids or the best stand mixers.\u00a0 Another thing that peeves me about stand mixer advertising is that the actual usable capacity is much smaller than the state capacity. The KitchenAid Classic Plus claims a 4.5-quart capacity, but the functional capacity is actually closer to 3 quarts. It'll accommodate single batches of most recipes, but don't expect to be doubling up on recipes in this mixer. Best value:\u00a0Cuisinart 5.5-Quart Tilt Head Stand Mixer \u2013\u00a0See at AmazonFor an impressive stand mixer at a lower price point, the Cuisinart Tilt Head has a powerful motor for mixing and kneading tough doughs, but is surprisingly light and compact. For the occasional or beginner baker, this is a great model to get started with. It's made with the same metal parts as more expensive KitchenAid stand mixers, has a strong motor, and a relatively roomy work bowl.\u00a0If a stand mixer seems out of reach for you, one of our best hand mixers might be a better choice. It'll take up less real estate on your counter and is great if you aren't ready to invest in a KitchenAid.

Here's Honda's latest: a $15,500 miniature truck.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/honda-15500-tiny-electric-truck-japan-photos-look-inside-2024-6","description":"Honda is getting into the tiny EV game with the N-VAN e, a miniature electric truck that starts at 2.44 million yen ($15,500).","date":"2024-06-14T12:14:24Z","content":"Japan is famous for its tiny vehicles, known as Kei cars, which are well suited for navigating the narrow streets of crowded cities like Tokyo. The country's best-selling electric vehicle last year was the Nissan Sakura, a $13,000 electric Kei car that outsold EV giants like Tesla, according to data from auto industry groups compiled by Bloomberg. Now, Honda is getting into the tiny EV game. The Japanese automaker has unveiled the N-VAN e, a miniature electric truck that starts at 2.44 million yen ($15,500). It comes as Japan lags behind the rest of the world in transitioning to EVs. Just 2.2% of new passenger cars sold in Japan in 2023 were electric, according to data from industry bodies, compared to 25% in EV pace-setter China, per Nikkei. Honda's electric truck will be targeted at delivery and construction companies rather than ordinary consumers. The company is already trialing the pocket-sized truck with logistic firm Yamato. The EV will have a range of 152 miles and will be able to charge in 30 minutes with fast charging, Honda says. Honda has also attempted to solve the issues EVs have in hot and cold temperatures, installing a battery cooling and heating system to ensure it remains at a stable temperature. The company says the N-VAN e will also function as a mobile power storage device, with drivers able to use the truck's external power outlet to charge household appliances such as hot plates and electric kettles. The N-Van can seat between one and four people, depending on which style the buyer selects; each option varies in price. The truck is expected to launch in Japan in October. Separately, Honda announced it would establish a new company in partnership with fellow Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi. The new joint venture, Altna, will aim to lower the cost of electric vehicles and extend the lifetime of EV batteries. Like other Japanese automakers, Honda was slow to get into the EV game. However, it is now racing to electrify, investing $11 billion in a Canadian EV hub and pledging to have 80% of its vehicle lineup be EVs by 2035 and 100% by 2040.

The Blue Oval is ending its controversial EV dealership program less than two years after it was first announced, Ford Chief Operating Officer Marin Gjaja told reporters Thursday, according to CNBC. Ford dealers will no longer be required to invest in certification to get EVs on their lot, opening battery-electric sales to Ford's entire dealership network \u2014 a move Gjaja said is designed to grow Ford's EV sales. The program, first announced in September 2022, asked dealers to spend between $500,000 and $1.2 million to become \"EV Certified.\" The steep price included expensive DC fast-chargers for dealer lots to double as charging locations and EV training for staff. This rigorous buy-in program was built on optimistic EV sales forecasts that dealers would make back their investments as electric-car popularity increased. But a lot has changed in the US EV market since the fall of 2022, and growth in the segment hasn't played out as Ford initially expected, Gjaja said. EV sales have slowed down in the past year. They are still on the rise but at a slower rate than the boom in growth that happened between 2020 and 2022. With wealthy early adopters largely sated, car companies are now trying to entice a new group of EV shoppers who are more frugal and practical. Ford dealers were among the first to raise alarm bells about this slowdown when some stores started turning down Mustang Mach-E allocations last summer. Later, dealers started reporting issues with F-150 Lightning demand \u2014 further eroding Ford's relationship with its dealers. Since then, Ford and other major automakers have gone back to the drawing board on their EV strategies. Even before this slowdown in EV sales, many Ford dealers were unhappy with the high price of entry for selling electric cars. Several dealer associations filed lawsuits related to the program. In one case, an Illinois board ruled in favor of the dealers' claim that Ford's EV certification program violated state laws. As of December of last year, a little more than half of Ford's nearly 3,000 US dealers had opted out of the EV investment requirements, an early sign that the program had backfired. Ford's dealers will still need to make some investments to support EV sales on their lots, but they will no longer be held to the minimum $500,000 investment.

Last summer, President Joe Biden's Education Department launched the SAVE plan \u2014 a new student-loan repayment plan intended to make payments more affordable for borrowers with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness than prior income-driven repayment plans. The department already started rolling out some of SAVE's provisions ahead of schedule, including loan forgiveness for borrowers with original balances of $12,000 or less who made as few as 10 years of qualifying payments. Beginning in July, a host of new provisions are expected to be implemented. One of those provisions will allow borrowers with undergraduate student loans to have their payments capped at 5% of their discretionary income, which is down from the current 10% cap. However, as The New York Times first reported, the Education Department is still working through those new calculations and is placing impacted borrowers on administrative forbearance \u2014 during which they are not required to make payments and interest will not accrue \u2014 as it works toward implementing this new part of SAVE. Education Department spokesperson Vanessa Harmoush confirmed the forbearances, telling Business Insider that as the department finalizes the new SAVE payments, \"some borrowers may be placed in a brief processing forbearance to ensure they can access the full benefits of the SAVE Plan and that their new payment amounts are accurate.\" \"While borrowers are in this specific forbearance, no payment is required, their interest rate will be set to 0%, and they will receive credit toward IDR forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF),\" she said. A department spokesperson added that the department \"has already sent servicers the information they need for hundreds of thousands of borrowers, some of which should see updated billing statements for July,\" and that 4.6 million borrowers who have $0 payments under SAVE will not need to enter forbearance. Given that borrowers typically receive bills for their student-loan payments a few weeks before the due date, this forbearance period will ensure that borrowers do not make a larger payment than necessary before the Education Department has time to calculate the new amounts. Aside from SAVE's implementation, the student-loan servicing industry is undergoing a series of changes that are impacting borrowers' user experience. For example, the Education Department is transitioning the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program away from servicer MOHELA and is instead splitting up PSLF accounts among other servicers to be overseen by Federal Student Aid. The Education Department is also working toward implementing its new student-loan forgiveness plan after the Supreme Court struck the first one down last summer, and it is continuing to carry out its one-time account adjustments for borrowers on PSLF and income-driven repayment plans, expected to be completed in September.

So much so that some Swifties on social media are playfully dubbing the COVID-19 infection they think they got from her concerts a \"souvenir\" and a \"gift\" from \"Mother.\" A post on X from a Spanish Taylor Swift fan account asked followers: \"Did you go to #MadridTStheErasTour and take COVID, a virus, or a cold with you as a souvenir? I open a survey.\" \u00bfFuiste al #MadridTStheErasTour y te llevaste de recuerdo covid, alg\u00fan virus o alg\u00fan resfriado? Abro encuestita: Of the nearly 10,800 votes, 35% voted yes. People in the poll's comments section described their symptoms and showed their positive COVID-19 tests \u2014 but also raved about how they thought it was worth it.  The poll has been viewed nearly 144,000 times at press time. One X user commented: \"Going to Taylor's concert has meant losing my voice, losing my mental health and, well, my health in general, I'm more dead than alive (but I would go to the concert a thousand more times).\" Earlier in February, an Australian concertgoer posted a TikTok of herself dressed up in her concert outfit and glam makeup. The video then cut straight to her holding up a positive COVID-19 test kit in bed. She captioned the post: \"The Eras Tour souvenir no ones talking about. if youre heading to the sydney shows this weekend, wash your hands regularly!\" However, other X users have voiced their disbelief at Swifties calling the virus a souvenir. One X user wrote: \"Taylor Swift's concert attendees are calling their Covid infections 'souvenirs' and 'gifts' from 'Mother,' and I'm supposed to NOT wanna launch myself into the sun???\" Concerts have gained notoriety as COVID-19 superspreader events. In 2021, over 2,200 people caught the virus after going to music festivals in northeast Spain. And while the virus is treated more like the common flu now, COVID-19 is still circulating \u2014 and people are getting infected across the US. Virus-spreading or not, Swift's Eras Tour has been widely successful, propelling the singer-songwriter to billionaire status. Swift is now in the UK for her next leg of the tour.  Swift's representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

For months, Ye has been trying to sell his beachfront property on Malibu Road in Southern California. The home \u2014 one of a handful of residential properties in the US designed by the iconic Japanese architect Tadao Ando \u2014 is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Tony Saxon. Saxon was the project manager Ye commissioned in 2021 to oversee the house's redesign. He is accusing the artist of putting him in dangerous working conditions and failing to pay his wages. Ye's attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Since he was hired, Saxon received a number of demands from Ye, including stripping the property of its windows, plumbing, and other amenities, according to the lawsuit. A video provided to The New Yorker shows Saxon's coworker smashing the home's glass balustrade with a hammer. Another request from Ye was to replace the home's concrete staircase with a ramp or a slide, Saxon told The New Yorker. Saxon had proposed to the artist a slide made of stainless steel while Bianca Censori, Ye's wife, sent her husband three renderings of a concrete ramp, according to The New Yorker. Ye has publicly shared his curious disdain for staircases. In a 2022 interview with Alo Yoga cofounder Danny Harris, Ye said he was \"really big on outlawing stairs\" and that all homes should be designed to cater to older adults. \"We can have up-ramp but not upstairs,\" he said. \"Everything should be designed like an old-folks home.\" Ye's fraught view of stairs has even been mentioned in a lawsuit filed by former staff members of Donda Academy, Ye's secretive private school. The ex-employees alleged in the suit that Donda Academy students were not allowed to have class on the second floor because the artist was \"reportedly afraid of stairs.\" The lawsuit accused Ye of seven labor code violations and discrimination. A trial is scheduled for April 2025. Despite the artist's vision for universally designed homes, The New Yorker's Ian Parker, who reported on Ye's Malibu home and visited the property, wrote that the ramps that Ye proposed \"appeared to be at least four times as steep as any allowed by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\" Parker also wrote that the ramps ended near the edge of the home's terrace that lost its barrier or railings during the demolition process. \"Someone descending the ramp from the primary bedroom on, say, a skateboard, could expect to shoot off the edge and land some thirty feet below, on the beach,\" Parker wrote. Ye's incomplete work on the home has essentially made the home uninhabitable due to the lack of power and plumbing. The Malibu home was first listed last year with the Oppenheim Group real estate firm for $53 million. The asking price has since been reduced to $39 million. Jason Oppenheim of Oppenheim Group told The New Yorker that a full renovation would cost at least $5 million. A spokesperson for Oppenheim Group did not immediately return a request for comment.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who has repeatedly snubbed Russia, said in parliament Wednesday that he'd take his country out of the Moscow-led CSTO alliance, The Associated Press reported. Pashinyan said his government would decide later when to make the move, according to the AP. Experts previously told Business Insider that Putin founded the alliance \u2014 made up of Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan \u2014 as a rival to NATO and that he wanted to project power by leading a multinational body, despite most of the members not having notable militaries or large economies. However, the plan seems to have backfired as tensions among the alliance have grown, especially since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Pashinyan's latest announcement is likely a huge blow to Putin. The prime minister told lawmakers: \"We will leave. We will decide when to leave. We won't come back. There is no other way.\" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, said Thursday that Russia \"will continue to work with our Armenian friends\" to clarify their position, the state-controlled Russian news agency TASS reported. Peter Frankopan, an expert on Russian and Balkans history at Oxford University, told BI that while other CSTO countries would likely give a \"shrug of the shoulders,\" Moscow would ultimately have a stronger response. Moscow will likely see Armenia as trying \"to be too big for small boots \u2014 so no doubt there will be repercussions in order to show the downsides of daring to stand up to Russia,\" he said, adding: \"What those are, and when they play out, is a matter of guesswork.\" In the immediate aftermath, Armenia's foreign minister denied Pashinyan said the country was withdrawing, in an apparent attempt to soften the diplomatic impact, the AP reported. Tensions have heightened between Russia and Armenia since Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which Pashinyan has refused to endorse on multiple occasions. Pashinyan said in June 2023 that his country was \"not Russia's ally in the war with Ukraine\" and that it felt trapped between Russia and the West. Relations between Russia and other CSTO members have also become more strained since the invasion, with countries seeing how caught up Russia is in Ukraine \u2014 leaving some worried about how protected they are if attacked, experts previously told BI. Pashinyan was also irked when Russian peacekeeping troops did not come to Armenia's aid last year when Azerbaijan attacked a separatist region that had been largely under the control of ethnic Armenians. He had previously called the CSTO response to the conflict \"depressing\" and \"hugely damaging to the CSTO's image both in our country and abroad.\" Pashinyan raised that issue again on Wednesday, accusing unspecified CSTO countries of conspiring against Armenia in the conflict. \"It turned out that its members failed to fulfill their obligations under the treaty and planned the war against us alongside Azerbaijan,\" Pashinyan said, per the AP. Frankopan said the latest development may not end with Armenia leaving the CSTO if negotiations take place. \"Talking about withdrawal can give a chance to course-correct for all sides, so it might be that we are seeing a round of shadowboxing, rather than something more definitive,\" he said. But he added that an Armenian withdrawal would be \"a long time coming,\" given the country's escalating complaints about Russia's leadership of the alliance. Other recent Armenian snubs to Russia include the country joining the International Criminal Court in February, even though it has issued an arrest warrant for Putin. Armenia froze its CSTO membership in February but until Wednesday had not clarified its position. In June, at a meeting of CSTO member states' foreign ministers, Armenia was asked to clarify its membership status, with its foreign minister later saying only that he had \"excellent personal relations\" with the bloc's secretary-general.

After years of controversy, it's a whole new ride.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/tianas-bayou-adventure-ride-magic-kingdom-disney-world-worth-it-2024-6","description":"Tiana's Bayou Adventure, which took the place of Splash Mountain at Magic Kingdom, opens June 28, but I got to preview the new water ride.","date":"2024-06-14T14:13:01Z","content":"In 2020, Disney announced it would close the popular but controversial Splash Mountain at both Disney World and Disneyland. There was plenty of upset and backlash from fans of the classic ride. But its story was based on the 1946 movie \"Songs of the South,\" which has been criticized for featuring a racist representation of the American Old South. In its place, Disney created a new \"Princess and the Frog\"-themed water ride called Tiana's Bayou Adventure, with the company's first Black princess front and center. I got a chance to ride the new Magic Kingdom attraction early as part of a media preview event ahead of its official opening on June 28. Here's what it's like. Before loading into the log-style ride vehicles, a large outdoor queue area snakes around a concrete plaza. This largely unshaded outdoor area can get very hot, so I'd bring a handheld fan or an umbrella during the summer months to help keep cool. Just before heading inside, I spotted Tiana's delivery truck decorated in Mardi Gras colors. After walking through the outdoor line, I reached the covered indoor section of the queue, which was almost cuter than the actual attraction. I loved all of the hidden details. But one of the first things I saw was a newspaper folded up on a wooden table. The headline read, \"Princess Tiana throws a Mardi Gras Party for all of New Orleans.\" This was my first big clue for what to expect from the ride itself. Just past the table, on the shelf above the desk, there's a little Easter egg paying tribute to Splash Mountain: fox, bear, and bunny tchotchkes placed together as a nod to Brer Fox, Brer Bear, and Brer Rabbit. If you've ever watched \"The Princess and the Frog,\" you'll know that gumbo, a stew-like dish that's famous in New Orleans, is a big part of the story. I loved seeing a framed copy of Tiana's dad's famous recipe on the wall of the queue. I snapped a picture just to try out the recipe myself. Just past the gumbo recipe, I peeked into Tiana's kitchen, where a plate of beignets was covered in powdered sugar on the table.  It even smelled like powdered sugar inside the kitchen. The log-style ride vehicles for Tiana's Bayou Adventure looked very similar to the ones from Splash Mountain \u2014 I wouldn't be surprised if they just recycled the old ones. They each have four rows that can comfortably fit two adults each. I got a seat in the back row of the log. After the first lift hill, I got my first look at the impressive new animatronics that Disney created for the attraction, which is set a year after \"The Princess and the Frog\" ends. Princess Tiana welcomed us to the bayou and let us know what to bring to the party. The ride continued down into the bayou past Louis and Mama Odie from the movie. Throughout the ride, there were familiar songs from the movie. But there was also an all-new song called \"Special Spice,\" sung by Anika Noni Rose, who voiced Tiana. The most famous part of Splash Mountain was probably the big drop into the briar patch, and that track remained the same for the reimagined water ride. Luckily, in the back of the log, I didn't get very wet throughout the ride, including the big drop. My favorite part of the ride was the final scene, where all the characters gather for a big celebration.  Each of the critters we passed during the ride is now playing music for the party. One of my favorite details was seeing Gritty, the rabbit, playing the washboard, which is actually the license plate from Tiana's truck outside.  I only ended up riding Tiana's Bayou Adventure once during the preview event. Although it's not my favorite ride at Disney World (that spot belongs to Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind), it's great to have something new. I also loved everything the Disney creatives did to make the attraction feel like it was plucked right out of New Orleans. When Tiana's Bayou Adventure officially opens at the end of the month, Magic Kingdom will only offer a virtual queue, as has been the case for other recent rides. But you can also purchase Genie+ or an Individual Lighting Lane to ride. The minimum height requirement is 40 inches. The ride doesn't have scary story elements, but some parts are dark, and the big drop could be too much for younger kids.

At least, that's the advice McKinsey's chief client officer, Liz Hilton Segel, gave one eager intern at the firm. \"My advice to her was to be an outstanding prompt engineer,\" Hilton Segel told The Wall Street Journal.  McKinsey is among a handful of top consulting firms capitalizing on the generative AI frenzy. Its record $16 billion in revenue last year came, in part, from new work relating to the technology. The firm has also launched its own in-house generative AI tools, including Lilli, named after Lillian Dombrowski, the first woman employed by McKinsey in professional services.  Lilli's purpose is to aggregate the firm's knowledge and capabilities so that employees can spend more time engaging with clients, Erik Roth, a senior partner at McKinsey who oversaw Lili's development, said last year in a press release announcing the tool. Tools like Lilli allow employees to cut down on busy work if they learn to prompt \u2014 the process of eliciting information from these tools \u2014 and focus their skills on higher-value tasks. Roth said at the firm's media day last month that 72% of consultants now use Lilli. \"We've answered over 3 million prompts and add about 120,000 prompts per week,\" he said. \"We are saving on average up to 30% of a consultants' time that they can reallocate to spend more time with their clients instead of spending more time analyzing things.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Experts say that's a gross exaggeration. The African National Congress, led by Nelson Mandela in the 1990s, recently outlined its plan to expand South Africa's Social Relief of Distress program. The temporary grants were rolled out during the pandemic to help struggling citizens meet basic needs. The ANC, now in coalition talks after winning just 40% of the vote in recent national elections, said it would boost the value of payouts and expand the program to more vulnerable people including caregivers, the unemployed, and the precariously employed. It promised to finalize the policy within two years of being elected. The party also suggested it could fund the program by introducing progressive taxes such as a social security tax, and emphasized it wouldn't replace existing welfare programs or public services. It also signaled it would increase payments and expand eligibility over time. Cleo Goodman, the basic income lead at think tank Autonomy, told Business Insider that the ANC's proposal followed years of basic income advocates making their case through \"pilots, research and widespread campaigning.\" South Africa's civil society is also eager to expand the Social Relief of Distress grants to redistribute wealth, reduce poverty, stimulate the job market, and help people cover the costs of finding work, she said. Goodman said that what began as an emergency pandemic response has \"instigated a serious move towards providing genuine economic security, through an unconditional cash transfer system that approaches universality.\" Yet the ANC's plan doesn't truly qualify as a UBI program, which usually provides recurring cash payments to all adults in a population regardless of their wealth or employment status, and with no restrictions on how the money is spent. \"Despite the name, this proposal falls far short of a basic income,\" Karl Widerquist, a philosophy professor at Georgetown University-Qatar and the author of several books about UBI, told BI. \"The payments are too small; they are means-tested; and they are means-tested in a way that makes it hard for some of the neediest, eligible people to get the funds they are entitled to,\" he continued. Widerquist also flagged the potential for a \"poverty trap\" where people could lose the entire grant once their income rises above a certain threshold, discouraging them from earning too much and knocking them back when their earnings improve. The writer and academic said the ANC's plans to extend the program are promising, but the initial proposal is only a \"small step in the right direction.\"  He added that the timing \"could be good or bad,\" as the ANC's coalition partners could hold it accountable for passing the policy if they support it, but if they oppose it then it \"could easily fall by the wayside over the next few years.\" It's not surprising to see the ANC propose a targeted poverty-alleviation program instead of a full UBI scheme. The former is cheaper, less radical, and likely to be more palatable to voters than handing cash to the wealthy \u2014 even if new taxes would make them net contributors. But UBI proponents say that giving too little money to too few people doesn't effectively combat poverty, and can stigmatize the grants as welfare checks. A compromise scheme also fails to provide a safety net that allows people to take time to find the right job if they get laid off, and may not fully recognize the value of domestic labor such as child and elderly care either.

His wife retired three years after him at age 35. For years, the two saved most of their income, poured money into passive investments, and worked long hours to achieve financial independence \u2014 the point at which they wouldn't need to work to cover their long-term expenses. \"It's really a journey of balancing your finances, figuring out passive incomes, covering your expenses, buying the things that you want that'll improve quality life like a house, and then also being willing to go back to work in either part-time or full-time capacity once you have that void to fill,\" Dogen said. Dogen and his wife are FIREs \u2014 financial independence, retire early \u2014 who make it work with two kids in one of the US's most expensive cities. He said it's uncommon for both people in a couple to reach FIRE at around the same time. Raising their kids has been a full-time job for both of them, but both have found peace in pursuing \u2014 and monetizing \u2014 their passions while relying on passive income to fund their vacations and entertainment. In a way, both have rejected the \"RE\" in the FIRE acronym, though neither plans to return to an office job. In 1999, Dogen got his first job in investment banking in New York City, making $40,000 and splitting a studio apartment with a roommate to save money. He said he would work late to get free cafeteria food, which he saved for the next day, meaning he rarely spent on groceries. \"I figured if I could save 100% of every other paycheck, that would be saving 50% of my salary, and every year I saved 50% of my salary was one year of living,\" Dogen said. \"I took it a step further: I saved every other paycheck, and I saved and invested 90% of any discretionary year-end bonus. I did that essentially for 13 years in a row.\" He moved to San Francisco for another position and rose through the ranks throughout the 2000s. In 2003, he bought a two-bedroom condominium, which allowed him to fix his living expenses for the next few years. He said this was one of the keys to achieving financial independence. However, in 2009, he estimates he lost 35% to 40% of his net worth in six months. That year, he started his blog, Financial Samurai, chronicling his journey to financial independence while continuing at his company and rebuilding some of his net worth. But, after surviving seven rounds of layoffs, he realized he had enough in the bank to quit his $250,000-a-year job without rushing to another job. \"I realized that after 10 years, I wasn't having any fun anymore,\" Dogen said. \"It's very stressful, and I wanted out, but I didn't know how to get out because I just didn't plan that far.\" He negotiated a severance package in 2012, which allowed him to keep his deferred stock and cash compensation. At the time, his net worth was $3 million, and he had saved between 75% and 80% of his income over the previous few years. \"I never let lifestyle inflation get to me, and I was driving old cars, living in very humble homes,\" he said. Though he had a large nest egg and passive investments, he wondered for a few years if he had made the right choice. His wife made $120,000 a year, but he was unsure if his retirement would only be temporary. Still, his health improved shortly after quitting, and he realized how much pressure he had been under that was lifted off his shoulders. \"I was like, what am I doing? I'm only 35 years old, leaving a well-paid job behind, losing so much money,\" Dogen said. \"But as the months went by, I felt more calm because I had way more freedom, and I was happier. The chronic back pain and sciatica and teeth grinding went away within six months.\" Early in his career, he knew he wanted to achieve financial independence and retire early, but he didn't want to leave the city. He said it's rare for people who reach FIRE to live in expensive coastal cities, noting many move to suburbs or more rural areas where the cost of living is lower. He knows couples making well into the six figures who struggle to save between housing and raising children. \"If you plan to stay in a high-cost-of-living area and you want to FIRE, you have to focus on ways to build wealth that outstrip the cost of living,\" Dogen said. In addition to the income he earned from his blog, he poured money into stocks and real estate. He also followed various budgeting guidelines like spending no more than 10% of gross income on cars. He follows a 30% rule for homebuying as well. \"I feel like there's this whole world out there who just kind of wing it when it comes to their personal finances, and then they wake up 10 years later and wonder where all their money went because there aren't disciplines or ratios or guidelines that they follow,\" Dogen said. When he retired, he told his wife that if she could stay in her job for three more years until she turned 35, both could retire early and still make enough in passive income to live comfortably. They upped their savings rate and tried to maximize passive income during those years. \"One of the interesting phenomena you'll see in the FIRE space is how a man will proclaim he's retired early, but he'll have a working wife,\" Dogen said. \"It's a head-scratcher because I don't know a single stay-at-home mom who says she's retired early. She just says she's a stay-at-home mom because it's a full-time job. It's crazy how much work it is.\" In 2015, his wife also negotiated a generous severance package after her company tried to keep her working part-time. She returned to the company after a few months, making more in a part-time position than she did working full-time. She stopped in 2016, shortly before having their first child. \"It's really methodically saving and investing as much as possible for as long as possible,\" Dogen said. \"Too many people get in credit card debt, buying things they don't need, expensive vacations.\" Are you part of the FIRE movement or living by some of its principles?

While the dollar is still by far the most dominant currency in the forex reserves of the world's central banks, the greenback's share in these reserves \u2014 after exchange-rate and interest-rate adjustments \u2014 declined from over 70% in 2000 to about 55% in the last quarter of 2023, according to IMF's data. The dollar has been strengthening against most currencies in recent years \u2014 indicating that private investors have moved into dollar-based assets. This effect masked the shift of central banks and governments out of dollar reserves. The Dollar Index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has gained 4% this year to date and about 7% since March 2022, when the US Federal Reserve started its last interest-rate hike cycle. The dollar's share hasn't been overtaken by the world's other three major currencies \u2014 the euro, the Japanese yen, or the UK pound sterling. Instead, the shares of \"non-traditional reserve currencies\" have risen, according to the IMF. These include the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singaporean dollar, and Nordic currencies. The IMF's findings are consistent with its previous report in 2022 when it found that the dollar's dominance was waning and getting replaced with alternative currencies. \"These nontraditional reserve currencies are attractive to reserve managers because they provide diversification and relatively attractive yields, and because they have become increasingly easy to buy, sell and hold with the development of new digital financial technologies,\" wrote IMF's economists in their latest report, which is based on data from 149 reporting economies that collectively account for 93% of global forex reserves. The IMF's report comes amid ongoing discussions about de-dollarization. With the use of sanctions, the West effectively shut Russia out of the global, greenback-based financial system after Moscow started the war in Ukraine. Other countries are now concerned that they, too, could be locked out of the US dollar-based financial system. However, the slow waning of the dollar's dominance in global forex reserves appears to be less about trade restrictions than diversification \u2014 because its decline has not accelerated in recent years despite the US' intensifying use of financial sanctions. Even so, there are other concerns that may erode confidence in the greenback, analysts have said recently. On Monday, two American think tank analysts wrote in the Financial Times that \"American dysfunction\" \u2014 political and fiscal \u2014 is the real threat to dollar dominance. This sentiment was also echoed by Jared Cohen, the president of global affairs at Goldman Sachs, in Foreign Policy. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Since then, I've applied to around 180 corporate jobs and have only gotten six interviews, none of which have led to getting hired. I've also applied for 18 \"bridge jobs\" \u2014 in-person roles in the service industry, many of which pay minimum wage or very low wages. I went through two rounds of interviews for one before being rejected for what felt like an arbitrary reason. Failing to land a bridge job completely changed my outlook on the job market. I knew it would be difficult to land a high-paying corporate job with benefits, a 401(k) plan, and stock options, but not being able to get a job pouring coffee or stocking shelves has made me lose faith. I started my career as a professional dancer in Chicago. To supplement my income, I also worked as a personal trainer, bartender, server, dance teacher, and babysitter. I got into real estate after one of my personal training clients recommended that I interview for an open role at the real estate development firm he worked for. I got hired and became the executive assistant to the CEO. I learned the business over the course of the first year, got my broker's license, and became a leasing manager. I worked there for almost five years. In October 2019, I left the firm for a better opportunity with a bigger developer. I thought this would be my career path for at least 10 years, but when COVID-19 hit, my job switched from growing the brand to just surviving. I was only there for a year before getting laid off in October 2020. That was the first time I'd ever been let go. I was unemployed for seven months before joining WeWork as a leasing manager. I worked for WeWork for two years, but in March 2023, I was laid off again. Four months later, I got a new job but was only there for around 90 days before they laid me off in November 2023. I applied to 11 jobs in December, 30 in January, around 60 in both February and March, and 20 in April. I applied for jobs I was qualified for in Chicago and elsewhere and to any and all types of roles \u2014 in-person, remote, and hybrid. I even applied for jobs I'm overqualified for, with much lower salaries than I wanted. I was networking and doing everything you're \"supposed\" to do, but I couldn't get any traction on anything. In March, I started looking for bridge jobs. I applied to about 18 bridge jobs, like barista, grocery-store shelf stocker, and store manager. I heard nothing back besides some auto-rejections. Many of these bridge jobs also required cover letters. I explained that I'd lost my corporate job and wanted to change industries. I talked about wanting to learn something new from the bottom and why I was interested in the job. I still got zero responses. I started wondering, are they not hiring me because my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is too corporate? Bridge jobs may not want to hire people they think will leave. I understand that, but I don't know what they can expect if they pay minimum wage. In April, I had to leave my life in Chicago and move back in with my parents in South Carolina. I applied for a guest itinerary designer role at a luxury resort down the street. There were a lot of requirements, but it paid $18 an hour plus potential commission, and I thought it'd be a great bridge job. I connected with the interviewer and landed a second interview, which also went great. I was excited for the third interview, sent my availability, and promptly stopped hearing back. After multiple follow-up emails and calls, I was told they couldn't hire me because I lived too close to the business, and they didn't want to hire anyone living in the neighborhood. I still don't understand why that's their policy. I'm pretty strong and confident, and I feel very lucky to have an amazing, supportive network of people. Yet, being unemployed has caused me to feel a lot of self-doubt, insecurity, and isolation. I got my first bartending job years ago because I was watching a football game at a dive bar and mentioned to the manager that I needed a job. It was slammed, and he said, \"Yeah, come in on Monday.\" Now, I have to answer 10 questions about my personality and tell the hiring manager something fun about myself in 120 characters, and I still don't hear back. One of my friends recommended I share my experience on TikTok. I quickly realized that my For You page was all other people who had been laid off. When I saw how many people were in the same boat, I started a Slack networking community that now has over 1,500 members. The people who have joined are so smart \u2014 there are molecular biologists and people with PhDs. If even they can't get a job, I'm screwed. It feels like everything I've learned and the knowledge I've gained from my amazing mentors is obsolete because nobody will give me a chance. I'm 34. I've built a career, am educated and smart, and have accomplished many things. I don't want to work somewhere for minimum wage \u2014 I've scrambled and worked five jobs before, and now it feels like I'm taking a hundred steps backward to when I was 22. I don't want to work at a bar until 4 a.m. anymore. I started an hourly freelance social media job for a construction company, which I heard about through a friend. I'd be willing to take on a second job, but what happened to being able to have one stable job with benefits? I'm still applying for jobs. I've never worked this hard trying to figure out what to do. I feel like I'll never stop looking for jobs because I'm afraid that any job I get won't last. I'll never approach the job market the same again.

That's helped by collaborations with celebrities like Andrew Scott.","date":"2024-06-13T09:11:01Z","content":"The founder and CEO of Quinn, Caroline Spiegel, knows she's supplying a niche demand, but she likes it that way. And it's working. Quinn, an app that lets subscribers listen to scripted erotic scenarios, is seeing listeners tune in for about 24 million minutes every month. \"It sort of takes the best elements of romance novels and condenses it into a 15 or 20-minute audio experience,\" Spiegel said. Quinn is a hit with Gen Z. According to metrics, about 56% of its user base are adults between the ages of 18 and 24. Its popularity on TikTok \u2014 also the home of BookTok, which has been instrumental in fueling a boom in \"romantasy\" fiction, which usually features a lot of \"spice,\" or erotic scenes \u2014 may have something to do with that. Many of the categories listed on its website match \"tropes\" regularly seen in romance novels, such as \"enemies to friends\" or \"co-workers.\" Subscribers pay $4.99 a month or $47.99 annually to have access to erotic audio clips from voice actors. Quinn says its revenue has grown 440% year over year for the past two years. Celebrity collaborations no doubt also help. One specific corner of the internet went feral in May when they found out actor Andrew Scott would voice a series for Quinn. The \"Fleabag\" star has already got an admiring fan base after his role as the so-called \"hot priest\" in the series, and as of Wednesday, the official account where the announcement was posted has more than 460,000 followers. \"I've never downloaded an app this quickly in my life,\" one of the top comments on Scott's video for Quinn reads. Audio clips on Quinn offer something for everyone's taste. Scott, for example, is the voice of \"The Queen's Guard,\" a historical fantasy with some explicit scenes. Spiegel, the younger sister of the Snap cofounder Evan Spiegel, said she began working on Quinn in 2019 while recovering from an eating disorder and experiencing sexual dysfunction (an issue that often isn't addressed in women). \"I felt like the way that I experienced desire wasn't really reflected in the options that were out there,\" she told Business Insider. Spiegel found solace in audio erotica on Reddit and Tumblr and wanted to bring the unique format to the masses, so she dropped out of Stanford University and launched Quinn in 2021, Forbes reported. Today, women make up 77% of Quinn's entire base. Quinn could be compared to OnlyFans, albeit without visuals, in that it's a platform for creators to get their content in front of a paying audience. But according to Spiegel, it's more like Peloton in that its creators are sort of like the fitness company's instructors, and \"people have their favorites that they go really hard for.\" To become a Quinn creator, applicants can answer a brief questionnaire and submit an audio recording sample similar to those already on the app. Quinn's other original celebrity collaborations \u2014 including the \"You\" actor Victoria Pedretti and Jesse Williams from \"Grey's Anatomy\" \u2014 have clearly appealed to Gen Z, and Spiegel teased that there were at least two more big names coming to the app in 2024. \"I feel like the biggest clue is that one is a woman and one's a man,\" she said.

We asked experts to put it to the test.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jeff-bezos-plan-colonize-space-experts-say-2024-6","description":"Jeff Bezos dreams of a future where a trillion humans live in the solar system. But experts are skeptical.","date":"2024-06-13T19:34:25Z","content":"When it comes to space exploration, Jeff Bezos dreams big. \"I would love to see a trillion humans living in the solar system. If we had a trillion humans, we would have, at any given time, 1,000 Mozarts and 1,000 Einsteins,\" he told podcaster Lex Fridman in a 2023 interview. To realize this dream, Bezos envisions a future beyond his lifetime where humans live on giant space colonies floating through our solar system, not on planets like Mars. \"The planetary surfaces are just way too small,\" to fit everyone, Bezos told Fridman. According to Bezos, leaving Earth would enable the human race to grow and thrive without destroying our home planet. Business Insider asked four different kinds of experts \u2014 from architects to astrobiologists \u2014 for their take on Bezos' plan. Here's what they said. In Bezos' futuristic fantasy, we're all kicking back in space stations that look similar to a concept called O'Neill cylinders, named for physicist Gerard K. O'Neill, who first proposed them in the 1970s. \"The vision of Gerard K. O'Neill is inspiring, but it's absolutely humongous,\" said Anthony Longman, an independent architect who put together a concept for space habitats designed to house roughly 8,000 people. That's notably larger than the International Space Station, which typically has seven astronauts on board at any given time. But a space habitat with 8,000 humans is nothing compared to O'Neill colonies that could house several million people and would be about 500 square miles, or as big as San Antonio, TX, inside. On the outside, these space colonies would measure 20 miles long, four miles wide, and rotate to generate artificial gravity for the humans onboard. O'Neill thought that we could establish natural ecosystems, bodies of water, and even weather systems inside. From there, we could build farms, transit systems, and bustling cities. \"I'm not saying they won't be built, but I think it will probably be some hundreds of years before we're able to build anything at that scale,\" Longman said of the O'Neill colonies. Bezos isn't suggesting that people will be living in O'Neill space colonies by the end of the century. Even so, that long-term vision is clearly shaping the present-day goals of Blue Origin, and the commercial space race at large. Both Blue Origin and its biggest competitor in the commercial space industry, Elon Musk's SpaceX, are developing technologies that Bezos and Musk hope could, one day, shepherd people to new lives outside of Earth. \"I won't live long enough to see the fruits of this, but the fruits of this come from building a road to space, getting the infrastructure,\" Bezos told Fridman. There are many issues to address before we can live on giant space stations and colonize the solar system. But to keep it simple, let's start with the basics: food and reproduction. Researchers have grown a few crops on the International Space Station, including tomatoes and lettuce. Although these veggies are grown in different conditions, they appear to be just as nutritious as ones grown on Earth, research shows. However, to achieve the scale of agricultural production necessary for an O'Neill colony, \"we need to develop these very safe, closed-loop, self-sustainable agricultural systems,\" said Rebeca Gon\u00e7alves, an astrobiologist formerly at the European Space Agency whose research focuses on how we might grow crops off-world, like on Mars. As for human reproduction in space, Adam Watkins, associate professor of reproductive biology at the University of Nottingham, said we have a long way to go. \"Giving birth in space \u2014 you just don't even want to contemplate the logistics and the difficulties that might be associated with that, let alone if there are any complications associated with it,\" he said. As far as we know, no one has ever had sex in space. And we've certainly never sent a pregnant person to space. The health risks are too high, Watkins said. Those risks stand in the way of research that could reveal how space radiation affects a developing fetus. So, scientists aren't sure what the impact would be. To eliminate those risks, space colonies would need healthcare systems that are just as equipped to handle reproduction as Earth's are, Watkins said. \"It's one thing getting people into space, we can do that. That's fairly straightforward.\" Watkins said, adding that the hard part is \"building those entire infrastructure communities where you've got those kinds of support structures in place, fully functioning, tried and tested, I think is a very long way off.\" Our industrialized presence on the planet is driving climate change, resource scarcity, and a biodiversity crisis. Leaving Earth is a way for humanity to continue on its current path and preserve Earth in the process, according to Bezos. \"We want to use a lot of energy. We want to use a lot of energy per capita. We've gotten amazing things. We don't want to go backward,\" he told Fridman. But Martin Rees, the United Kingdom's Astronomer Royal who advises the monarchy on astronomical matters, doesn't think that leaving Earth behind is the best option, he told Business Insider. Using space as an \"escape for the problems we may cause with our own planet,\" is a \"dangerous illusion,\" he said. \"We should look after our own planet. It's the best we've got.\" Saving Earth would be far easier than building Bezos' space colonies, he told BI. Even if we never make it to space colonies, the work of researchers studying extraterrestrial colonization could benefit us here on Earth. For example, Gon\u00e7alves' research on Martian agriculture could help improve crop resiliency in degraded, sandy soils on our planet, she said. \"I don't think these O'Neill-type space colonies are going to be nearly as attractive to spend your life on as it is to be living on Earth with its wonderful variety,\" Rees said.

The carmaker announced the results of the shareholder vote during the company's annual meeting on Thursday. Musk did a victory dance as he took the stage amid cheers from on-site investors. \"I just want to start off by saying: \"Hot damn! I love you guys,\" Musk said. Tesla shares held after-hours gains of more than 1% after the vote. Investors had initially approved the compensation plan in 2018, but a Delaware judge voided it in January after a shareholder filed a lawsuit alleging the agreement was \"beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment.\" In January, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said she had decided to strike down the pay package because she believed Musk had undue influence over the agreement and its approval due to his close ties to several board members, one of which is his brother. Tesla has yet to appeal the decision, but the company hopes to use the shareholder approval to argue that the ruling is moot now \u2014 the question now is whether the Delaware court will agree. The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that it will seek to reverse the ruling and will use an affirmative vote to do so. When the compensation package was voided, it was estimated to be worth around $55 billion \u2014 making it the largest pay package to ever be awarded to a CEO. Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla. His pay was determined by his ability to hit a series of financial goalposts. It consists of a 10-year grant comprising 12 sets of stock options. These options become available to Musk when Tesla achieves the specific goals. Each time a milestone is met, Musk receives stock equivalent to 1% of Tesla's outstanding shares at the time of the grant. By 2023, Tesla said it had successfully reached all 12 milestones. Tesla has argued that the pay package is both fair and necessary to maintain Musk's focus on the car company. And the company went all out in its efforts to promote Musk's pay package, paying for advertisements and even offering shareholders who voted a chance to win a tour of the Texas gigafactory alongside Musk. Some Tesla fans took to social media to promote the proposal, joining with some of the company's notable shareholders, such as Ron Baron of Baron Funds and Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who were quick to rally around Musk. \"Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk. Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla,\" Baron wrote in an open letter last week. One big reason investors are rallying around Musk: they are afraid of losing him \u2014 or at least his attention. The CEO has threatened to take his plans for AI and robotics elsewhere, saying that unless he had about 25% of voting control, he would \"prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" \"He is putting a knife at the throat of the company: 'You don't pay me what I want, then I am going to compete,'\" Anat Alon-Beck, a corporate law expert at Case Western Reserve University, told BI. During the annual meeting, Tesla announced that a proposal to move Tesla's state of incorporation to Texas had been approved. Earlier this year, Musk moved SpaceX's state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas as well. Additionally, shareholders approved a proposal to reelect Tesla board members Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch. This is a developing story. Check back for updates. Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Childhood was lonely, but I choose to be child-free. I fill my life with love in other ways.","date":"2024-06-13T21:20:16Z","content":"I\u00b4m in my 30s, but I joke that I\u00b4ve been a grandma since birth. I'm an only child, and my grandmother raised me while my parents were out of the picture. I grew up in a sleepy town built around fishermen and summer tourists. My grandmother's house was on a peninsula, a seven-mile stretch of the Atlantic on the south shore of Massachusetts. My grandmother was my world, and I understood from a young age that I was lucky to live with her; grandparents aren't obligated to raise their child\u00b4s child, and if it weren't for her willingness to act as my guardian, I\u00b4m not sure what would have become of me. But I still envied my peers with siblings or close cousins; I'd walk the beach with my grandma and long to join kids who were learning to surf with their parents or playing volleyball as a family, activities my aging grandmother simply couldn't keep up with. I\u00b4ve always had poor eyesight and often became clingy and afraid without my glasses. I'd never been able to see my grandmother from the water and dreaded seeing her become a blurry speck on shore. I remember her best up close: big dark eyes, small stature, knuckles gnarled from arthritis. I felt safer right beside her, where I could see her clearly and trust she wouldn\u00b4t simply disappear, but I knew better than to ask her to swim with me; she wore slacks and blouses to the beach for a reason. She raised six children, then me \u2014 I understood she was fragile, and that I was lucky to live with her during her golden years. She often told me, \"My body doesn't recover like yours,\" and encouraged me to do scary things on my own, like search for shells underwater and say hi to strangers. I didn't much enjoy childhood, but as a child-free adult by choice, I'm embracing the freedom being childless gives me with the support of my chosen family. Since moving from my grandmother's home more than a decade ago \u2014 first to New York, then Boston, then DC, then Atlanta, then Seattle, and now an island in the Caribbean \u2014 I\u00b4ve greeted many strangers and felt both lonely and beloved. Since her death eight years ago, I've traveled the world like my grandmother never got to \u2014 taken solo trips to Iceland for all-night sunshine, gone to Montreal for Pride, and recently, visited the French Alps to spend time with a friend and her wife \u2014 and even saved up for corrective eye surgery, hoping Lasik would make me braver, as well as more sporty and spontaneous. After Lasik, I did become braver \u2014 I joined strangers to go hiking, signed myself and my wife up for snowshoeing, and went camping with girls I knew from the internet. I felt less nerdy, less the shy girl hiding behind a book (though I did, and do, always carry a book with me). It's taken a return to the Atlantic, where my wife and I live for her job, to realize what I don't need is to simply see clearly, but to trust I have people looking out for me. My wife and I are firm on our decision not to have children, but after moving cross-country for work repeatedly, we\u00b4ve come to love hosting people at our home to build memories. My friend and her wife came to visit us from France, bringing with them a penchant for home cooking and tips on how to air-dry clothes. We snorkeled, swam, and spent long hours exploring the island. I fretted about nature cooperating, but my friend just reassured me they came to spend time with me \u2014 she doesn't even like the heat! Our friends are already planning to come back and stay with us again, creating new memories and traditions. They even discussed the logistics of bringing a future child and talked about names and parenting values. I hoped I'd have shaken the chronic loneliness of my childhood by the time I became an adult and learned to embrace being alone without feeling alone, but instead, I'm giving myself the company I always longed for. Over the years, I've joined a queer bowling league, played bingo orchestrated by drag queens, and dragged my wife to board game nights. Growing up, I was jealous of kids who had siblings because at least they had someone as a built-in companion, but nurturing friendships in adulthood is teaching me the value of a small but earnest circle. It's not about having people beside me, as I once envied, but about people who will forge the distance, even when it's a plane ride away. Watching my friends excitedly become parents affirms my decision not to. It could be tempting to have kids to facilitate the childhood I didn't have, filled with siblings and active parents, but parenting to heal childhood wounds feels misguided and puts the onus on a child who didn't ask to be here. I also don't trust myself to teach someone about the world when I\u00b4ve barely figured it out myself. My younger self wouldn't believe I\u00b4m not only openly gay but married, and she especially wouldn't believe I have people looking out for me, even when they're out of sight.

US Southern Command said the fast-attack submarine USS Helena is presently in Guantanamo Bay as part of a routine port visit while conducting a \"global maritime security and national defense mission\" through SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility. \"The vessel's location and transit were previously planned,\" the military wrote in a statement. The Helena is a Los Angeles-class submarine, a class of nuclear-powered boats that make up the backbone of the Navy's sub force. It was commissioned in the late 1980s and can be armed with torpedos, Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Meanwhile, more than 500 miles away on the other side of Cuba, in waters near Havana, is a flotilla of Russian naval vessels that arrived this week ahead of maritime exercises in the Caribbean. One of these vessels is the Kazan, a Yasan-class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine. US and other Western officials have long expressed concerns about Yasan-class subs like the Kazan because of their strike and stealth capabilities. These vessels are relatively new \u2014 the first in the class was commissioned just over 10 years ago \u2014 and they can be heavily armed to conduct attacks against targets on land and at sea. A spokesperson for SOUTHCOM said that the Helena's arrival in Cuba was not a direct response to the Russian naval vessels. \"Russia's activities pose no threat or concern to the United States, and we see no reason to alter previously planned, routine activity in response to Russian activity in the region,\" they said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday called the visit a \"normal practice\" and said Moscow doesn't see any reason to be concerned. The naval activity has been seen by some, however, as an attempt by Russia to flex its naval power after losing a string of warships in the Black Sea to Ukrainian missiles and drones, but if it's intended to project power, it's limited. The visit comes amid elevated tensions between Washington and Moscow over the Ukraine war. The US recently lifted some restrictions on the Ukrainians, allowing Kyiv to strike Russian territory with American-made weapons, a move that was met with anger by the Kremlin. Sabrina Singh, the deputy Pentagon spokesperson, said the US has been tracking the Russian naval movement and described the port call as a \"routine\" visit that does not come as a surprise. \"We're always constantly going to monitor any foreign vessels operating near US territorial waters,\" Singh said during a Wednesday briefing. \"We, of course, take it seriously, but these exercises don't pose a threat to the United States.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

But Netflix changed key parts.","date":"2024-06-13T18:29:39Z","content":"Warning: Major spoilers ahead for \"Bridgerton\" season three, part two, and the book \"Romancing Mister Bridgerton.\" Penelope Featherington's secret identity as Lady Whistledown is finally revealed in part two of \"Bridgerton\" season three. Since season one, Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) has secretly published a gossip column about London's high society under the pseudonym Lady Whistledown. In seasons two and three, Penelope's double life creates trouble for her as Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) and Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) begin hunting for Lady Whistledown's real identity. A similar storyline occurs in \"Romancing Mister Bridgerton,\" the Julia Quinn book this season is based on. \"Bridgerton,\" one of Netflix's most-watched series, has already made plenty of book changes (both good and bad), including revealing Penelope as Lady Whistledown to the audience way back in season one. But the Whistledown reveal in season three marks one of the biggest improvements the Netflix show has made so far. Here's how the TV series handles the Whistledown reveal differently and why this new plot is better. In \"Romancing Mister Bridgerton,\" Colin Bridgerton discovers Penelope's Whistledown secret before their engagement and is the first person to find out. Halfway through the book, Colin visits Penelope while figuring out his complicated feelings for her and sees her enter an unmarked carriage. Colin follows Penelope to a shady part of town and confronts her. During the carriage ride home, they argue about Penelope being Whistledown before kissing each other. Colin then proposes, much like he does in the series \u2014 except notably, in the book, he knows she's Whistledown when he asks her to marry him. The \"Bridgerton\" TV show goes in a different direction, with some key changes. Madame Delacroix (Kathryn Drysdale), a dressmaker, discovers Penelope's identity first in season two after bumping into her in the city center. They agree to be allies. Eloise, Penelope's best friend and Colin's sister, also discovers Penelope's secret in the season two finale. This reveal leads to a massive fight and a friendship breakup between the pair that continues throughout most of season three. In season three, episode four, Colin proposes to Penelope without knowing she is secretly Lady Whistledown. Therefore, in episode five, Eloise urges Penelope to tell Colin the truth before they marry. Eloise gives Penelope an ultimatum, but it doesn't matter. Just before Eloise reveals the secret to Colin herself, Cressida Cowper, Penelope's rival, falsely reveals herself as Lady Whistledown, throwing everything into disarray. Colin doesn't find out the truth until the end of episode six after overhearing Penelope and Eloise talk about Whistledown and following his fianc\u00e9e to the printer where she's delivered the latest edition of her column. This change raises the stakes for season three in two ways. Eloise becomes an obstacle in Colin and Penelope's relationship, adding pressure on Penelope to reveal the secret. In addition, Colin's anger is more justified since two people he loves have been hiding the big Whistledown secret from him. \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell told The Hollywood Reporter that she thinks the secret hits Colin harder this way because he is trying to prove himself to her. \"I think for Colin, the fact that he has given so much of himself to Penelope and shown her so much unconditional love and been really truthful about his feelings, it hits extra hard that she's been keeping a secret from him,\" she said. In both \"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\" and \"Bridgerton\" season three, London's high society decides to hunt down Lady Whistledown. In the book, Lady Danbury starts the hunt by offering a bounty of \u00a31,000 to whoever reveals her identity. But in the series, Queen Charlotte provides a bounty of \u00a35,000. In the book, Cressida pretends to be Lady Whistledown, is exposed by Penelope, and blackmails her. The TV series slightly changes this part of the storyline. Firstly, season three provides more depth into Cressida's circumstances. The audience discovers that Cressida doesn't come from a loving family and is a scared, lonely woman trying to make her own path in the world and escape an arranged marriage to an elderly man. Therefore, Cressida's drive in the show is to escape the confines of London's society with the bounty money. When Cressida fails to persuade the Queen that she is Lady Whistledown in episode six, her mother finally helps her pull off a fake Whistledown column. This spurs Penelope to write a Whistledown column to expose Cressida as a fraud. Penelope's attempt to stop Cressida leads Queen Charlotte to believe Lady Whistledown is a Bridgerton, and she confronts the Bridgertons in episode seven during Colin and Penelope's wedding breakfast. Later in the episode, Cressida also discovers that Penelope is Lady Whistledown after questioning a printer's apprentice. These particular changes make Cressida a more empathetic villain. In May, Jessica Madsen, who plays Cressida, told Business Insider of her character's journey in season three: \"I really saw it as her trying to do her best with very little understanding, very little knowledge, and very little perspective on reality until reality starts to smack her in the face.\" Penelope is also put under even greater pressure in part two since angering Queen Charlotte could have serious consequences. In the season finale, Cressida reveals what she knows to Penelope and Lady Featherington, asking for \u00a310,000 from Penelope to keep quiet about the secret. Ignoring her mother's advice, Penelope tells Colin and Eloise the truth. Colin takes charge from there and goes to Cressida to get her to recount her blackmail. He fails, and Cressida doubles the blackmail money. Colin also takes charge in the book series after discovering Cressida's blackmail, but he's more successful in that version of events. With help from his family, Colin reveals Penelope as Lady Whistledown during a ball, which leads to the whole of London's high society applauding her. The season three finale takes a different approach, and the show is better for it. In the show, instead of paying off Cressida, Penelope uses her Whistledown money to help her sisters pull off a ball they have been planning. She writes to the Queen, revealing her identity and asking the royal to expose her in the middle of the ball. Then, in front of London's high society, Penelope pleads her case, revealing why she started the column, apologizing to those she harmed, and promising to do better in the future. The Queen is charmed by the speech and promptly exits the party, satisfied, leaving Penelope standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. There is no applause and it is unclear if the party-goers accept Penelope's apology. But Philippa Finch (Harriet Cains), Penelope's sister, quickly changes the mood by releasing a cage full of butterflies into the room. After that, nobody seems terribly bothered by Penelope's reveal. And later in the episode, Penelope is writing another gossip paper, this time under her own name, indicating her plea likely worked. These changes work so much better for the Whistledown reveal. Giving Penelope a more prominent role in resolving the Cressida issue allows her to connect with her mother for the first time and rebuild her friendship with Eloise. It also gives Penelope agency in fixing her problems and organizing her own reveal of her secret identity. As Penelope says in the season finale, she doesn't need Colin to save her: Colin just needs to love and stand by her. The writers of the Netflix series give Penelope the opportunity to be the hero of her own story \u2014 not a woman who needs her husband to fix things for her.

Argentine news outlet Infobae reported on Tuesday that the country is holding talks with NATO, the US, and France to provide Ukraine with five Super \u00c9tendard fighter jets. The jets have been out of use and stored at an air-naval base since Argentina acquired them in 2019, due to a Falkland War-era embargo the UK imposed on Argentina, according to the outlet. The Falklands War, a ten-week undeclared war between the UK and Argentina, took place in 1982 over control of the Falkland Islands. Under existing UK sanctions, the South American country can't get cartridges needed to enable the pilot's seat to eject in case of emergency, the outlet reported, making the jets inoperable. Argentina is now holding talks with France to swap the jets for other military gear, such as drones and helicopters, it said. According to the outlet, the plan, approved by Argentina's President Javier Milei, would allow France to then fit the ejection seat cartridges and make them operable for use in Ukraine. Argentina's foreign and defense ministries and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in France didn't immediately respond to requests for comments. According to the outlet, Argentina's foreign minister, Diana Elena Mondino, discussed the issue in a meeting held at NATO headquarters in Brussels with her French counterpart, St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, and during an unannounced visit with US national security advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House. It didn't specify when these talks took place or what role the US and NATO are playing. Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron said France would send Mirage 2000 fighter jets to Ukraine. The jet \u2014 a multi-role fourth-generation fighter manufactured by French company Dassault Aviation \u2014 is a combat-proven aircraft like the F-16, having flown sorties in conflicts in the Middle East and the Balkans. But its effectiveness is limited by its air-to-air missiles, Justin Bronk, an airpower and technology expert at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute think tank, told BI last week. Meanwhile, an unnamed Ukrainian military source told Reuters in May that F-16s are expected to start arriving in Ukraine in either June or July. They could play a vital role in helping Ukraine reclaim Crimea, Frederik Mertens, a strategic analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, told BI last month.

Keeping his name off the paperwork may insulate him now that he's a felon.","date":"2024-06-13T22:04:15Z","content":"Keeping his name off the paperwork may protect former President Donald Trump if state officials anywhere in the US try to revoke liquor licenses at Trump-branded properties due to his new felony status, experts told Business Insider. New Jersey officials revealed this week that they are looking at the licenses at his three golf courses there. The licenses remain current at the three golf courses, located in Colts Neck, Bedminster, and Pine Hill, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Attorney General's office said, confirming that the division of alcoholic beverage control is \"reviewing\" the status of the licenses. More than a dozen bars and restaurants serve alcohol on the premises of Trump-branded or Trump-owned hotels and golf courses in New Jersey, New York, Florida, and California, a survey by Business Insider found. These states prohibit felons or people convicted of \"moral\" offenses such as fraud from holding a liquor license. But Trump \"is not the holder of any liquor license in New Jersey, and he is not an officer or director of any entity that holds a liquor license in New Jersey \u2014 or anywhere in the United States for that matter,\" the GOP presidential frontrunner said through a spokesman. That may keep him insulated. Trump may not be responsible for liquor licenses held in the name of his tenants or under LLCs for which he is not on the paperwork, experts said. If Trump's name is not connected to the license, then his conviction could be moot, said William Fay, a former New Jersey deputy attorney general who worked with the enforcement bureau of the state's division of alcoholic beverage control. Just because Trump's name is in the title of the LLC, doesn't mean he's a member or owner, Fay said. If he is a member of the LLC, then simply being licensed as an LLC wouldn't offer any sort of protection. If he's not a member, it could, Fay said. \"Just because he is not on the paperwork doesn't mean he's scot-free,\" explained Aaron H. Pierce, a Manhattan-based attorney who specializes in alcoholic beverage-control law in New York. Trump-branded properties in Manhattan house a half-dozen bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, including the memorabilia-crammed \"45 Wine & Whiskey Bar\" at Trump Tower. Say Trump is landlord to the bar operators at one of these properties, and it's the bar operators who hold the liquor license, Pierce said. Or say the bar is owned by an LLC for which Trump is not listed as a director or officer, he added. If Trump is charging the bar a flat rent, his felony status won't impact that liquor license. But if he is directly profiting from liquor sales \u2014 meaning getting a cut of the bar till \u2014 then that's another story, said Pierce, partner at the business law firm Pierce & Kwok LLP. \"If he's not on the paperwork, but he's profiting directly from the sale of alcohol, then he's not off the hook,\" he said. Trump would still have options, though, even if his hush-money conviction voided one or more of his liquor licenses. In New York, Trump could ask for a certificate of relief from civil disabilities, Pierce said. A \"CRD,\" as it's called, would be issued by the judge at or after sentencing, and it can help someone with a conviction overcome certain licensing requirements. If New Jersey determines that Trump's hush-money conviction disqualifies him as a licensee, as it's a crime of \"moral turpitude,\" Trump could divest from the LLC that owns the license, said Fay, the former prosecutor at the division's enforcement bureau. \"As I understand, it involves some sort of misrepresentations, so I would assume there's some fraud in that \u2014 so theoretically, it would be a moral turpitude crime,\" Fay said. \"Then, yeah, the next option would be to divest his interest.\" \"People do tend to pass it on to other LLC members. Sometimes you'll see family members,\" said Fay. \"But I would imagine this would be under some sort of close review at the ABC to make sure it's above board.\" Trump could also have his lawyers make the case at a hearing before an administrative judge that his conviction does not qualify for license-revocation, Fay said. Challenging the revocation could take months or years, during which the license would stay in place, Fay said. \"I don't imagine that will happen here,\" Fay said of a potential hearing. \"There may be conversations that occur proactively, whether it's the golf courses or Trump himself, to take action to absolve himself of a potential issue.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

On Thursday, Trump joined House Republicans for what was billed as a policy discussion to plan for the GOP's agenda if the former president wins in November. The gathering repeatedly went off the rails, according to multiple reports. One of the digressions was Trump's lingering resentment of Swift's support for President Joe Biden. \"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, CNN reported. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\" In meeting with House Rs, Trump attacked DOJ as \u201cdirty no good bastards\u201d and questioned Taylor Swift\u2019s support for Biden. \u201cWhy would she endorse this dope,\u201d Trump said, per members in room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to get off a stage.\u201d Swift endorsed Biden in 2020. She has yet to endorse any candidates in the 2024 cycle. The pop star previously avoided commenting on politics but became increasingly vocal, starting with Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee's successful candidacy in 2018. Swift's desire to weigh in on the race is detailed in her \"Miss Americana\" documentary. Trump, according to Politico, also noted that while in office, he signed a law geared toward helping songwriters. Trump was probably referring to the Music Modernization Act, a 2018 bipartisan law that changed royalties and licensing in light of the streaming era. Artists had pushed to update music copyrights for years. This is far from the first time Trump has commented on the world's biggest pop star. According to a forthcoming book about Trump's time as a reality-TV star, the former president repeatedly gushed that Swift was \"beautiful.\" \"I think she's beautiful \u2014 very beautiful! I find her very beautiful. I think she's liberal,\" Trump told the author, Ramin Setoodeh, according to an early excerpt from \"Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass.\" Trump couldn't be accused of being a Swiftie, though. Setoodeh said he had to explain that Swift was no longer focused on country music after the former president questioned how a country star could be liberal. \"She probably doesn't like Trump. I hear she's very talented,\" Trump said. \"I think she's very beautiful, actually \u2014 unusually beautiful!\" Tree Paine, Swift's longtime publicist, didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

The group of shareholders \u2014 the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, Michael Giampietro, and Daniel Hazen \u2014 filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of Tesla itself against Musk and Tesla in Delaware, where the company is incorporated. In it, the shareholders accuse Musk of diverting critical AI talent and resources away from Tesla and into his new AI-focused company, xAI. They also allege that Tesla's board hasn't tried to stop him. Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plaintiffs allege in the suit that Musk has recently touted Tesla as more of an artificial-intelligence company than simply an electric-car maker. He has, for example, repeatedly said that building out AI capabilities is essential to Tesla's growth and success, doubling down on this commitment both to investors and in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the lawsuit says. During Tesla's quarterly earnings report in April, the company gave investors a sneak peek at its plans for a robo-taxi fleet, sending the stock soaring despite posting weak financial data. But the plaintiffs say that ever since he founded xAI in 2023, Musk has poached AI-focused employees from Tesla and into his startup. At one point, in response to a suggestion that a major AI researcher should work for Tesla, Musk publicly commented that he should join xAI instead, the lawsuit says. It's not just AI talent that Musk is accused of pilfering from Tesla \u2014 the shareholders also allege that Musk has redirected critical Nvidia graphics processing units from Tesla to xAI, despite previously saying that the car company would gobble up the hardware as fast as Nvidia could deliver it. And Musk has flirted with focusing his AI efforts outside Tesla unless he gets a bigger stake in the company. In January, Musk posted on X: \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" The shareholders referenced that post in their lawsuit. As for Tesla's board of directors, the shareholders allege it's just bowing down to Musk. \"Consistent with its long history of obsequiousness to Musk, the Tesla Board has utterly failed to even attempt to meet its unyielding fiduciary duty to protect the interests of Tesla and its stockholders in the face of Musk's brazen disloyalty,\" the suit says. The shareholders demand that Musk and Tesla's board answer for what the suit says is their \"disloyalty\" and return what it describes as the value that Musk has pulled away from Tesla. Quite a lot of company value has been lost from Tesla of late, though it's unclear whether that's solely due to Musk's actions around talent. Tesla's stock has dropped more than 25% this year; some critics have argued Musk is being distracted by other projects. The sharp decline in Tesla stock has even affected Musk's proposed pay package, dropping it from an estimated $55 billion to $45 billion. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

While historically chrome accents have been used to position a vehicle as higher-end or protect against corrosion, CNN reports that Stellantis, the company behind Jeep, Dodge, and a dozen other car brands, is switching things up due to concerns over health and environmental risks. The change, internally dubbed the \"Death of Chrome\" at Stellantis, according to CNN, means new models will be missing the characteristic shine of chrome-plated parts. While the completed product is not believed to be harmful to consumers, hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium-6, is \"considered carcinogenic to workers,\" according to OSHA. The safety regulator says workers who inhale fumes or physically contact the chrome are at increased risk of developing lung, nasal, and sinus cancer. Chromium pollution also poses notable environmental concerns, potentially affecting soil, crops, and ecosystems upon contamination. In 2019, a Detroit interstate had to be closed down due to a hexavalent chromium spill from an electroplating plant to prevent water contamination. The National Association for Surface Finishing, an organization that represents the surface-coating industry, including chrome platers, told CNN that despite increasing safety measures, they were working to transition to the \"safest and most sustainable alternatives and replacements.\" A replacement that offers the same qualities as a finish sounds unlikely for production vehicles at this time. Stellantis' chief global designer, Ralph Gilles, told CNN that safer alternatives to chromium-6, like trivalent chrome, typically have a lesser-quality luster and the company will need to figure out a way to get people to fall out of love with traditional chrome. Therefore rather than trying to replicate the signature finish, Stellantis plans to promote completely new designs. For example, blacked-out models like the Chrysler Pacifica S Package replace typically chrome elements like trim pieces and badges with a black finish. Other alternatives include using light for accents or polished stainless steel, though that can be pricier to manufacture. Stellantis told CNN that it hopes these new looks will incentivize consumers to ditch the classic chrome look and sport a new kind of shine. Stellantis did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment ahead of publication. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

I have a deep understanding of how money problems can affect one's quality of life. Breaking the cycle of poverty and growing my nest egg have always been goals of mine. I've found ways to stay ahead of inflation and build my wealth so that my net worth can grow and I don't have to worry when I have a financial setback. I've been able to leave toxic work environments, make decisions not based entirely on money, and even take a year off from work to travel through South America. Most importantly, however, my approach to money has allowed me to feel safe and secure for the first time in my life. One way I've managed to stay ahead of inflation is by taking on side hustles. Diversifying my income has allowed me to continuously increase the amount I earn, which has provided extra money to save and invest each month. I target this money toward specific goals \u2014 like paying off student loans or saving up an emergency fund \u2014 and I always have one or two side hustles I can focus on if something happens to my primary job. When I started my financial journey, I kept my money in a high-yield savings account until I had enough for an emergency fund. These accounts typically accrue far more interest than traditional savings accounts, helping savings keep pace with inflation. In addition to keeping money I'll need in the next year or two in an HYSA, I've diversified my assets to allow my money to work for me. The majority of my wealth is invested in index funds and exchange-traded funds. Because these funds tend to provide solid returns, this money has grown exponentially and provided the largest growth in my nest egg. I've also invested in I bonds. Though their interest rates can vary and are sometimes below the rate of inflation, they can offer incredible value. In 2022, for example, the interest rate was 9.62%, which was a great time to buy $10,000 worth \u2014 the maximum amount allowed a year. Finally, I've maintained frugal habits even as my salary and net worth have grown. While I went from making about $10,000 the first year I was working to about $100,000 during my last school year as an educator, I haven't experienced significant lifestyle inflation. I've continued using credit-card rewards, couponing, and shopping sales, and I've avoided spending too much on a house or getting a car loan I don't need. It's easier to stay ahead of inflation when I'm not buying more than I need and when I'm using resources like coupons to my advantage. All these strategies have allowed me to continue to grow my wealth beyond what I thought was possible when I was a child. This has provided me with a safety net I can rely on when things go awry. When I found myself in a toxic work environment a few years ago, for example, I was able to quit without knowing for sure what would come next. I had the flexibility to make the choice that was right for me without having to worry about how I'd make it work financially \u2014 the ultimate luxury, and one I had been working toward my entire life. Setting my finances up in a way that has allowed me to have a sense of financial freedom has been liberating. I have enough money now that I can take time off from work and live on my savings and investments for a while if necessary, and I'm on track to retire early \u2014 hopefully by my mid-50s. I've seen many people who were forced into early retirement or who stayed in their jobs longer than they wanted to increase their pension amount. These situations further proved to me how important it is to have a nest egg that allows me to make life choices without money being the primary factor.

Musk mobilized his fan base to help push through his $55 billion pay package, and some of Tesla's biggest supporters scored invites to the annual meeting. Some also scored a factory tour with the CEO \u2014 one of many tactics Tesla used to boost the number of retail shareholders who voted on proposals, including Musk's pay package and one for Tesla to move its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas (which was also approved). Musk and Tesla's board did a full-court press in the lead-up to the vote, and it seems to have worked. The New York Times' DealBook reported that Tesla got a higher-than-usual number of retail investors to vote, and Musk's pay package passed with about 72% approval. Retail investors undoubtedly played a key role, but Tesla needed the support of some of its biggest institutional investors, like BlackRock and Vanguard, to get the pay package across the finish line. Vanguard was Tesla's largest outside investor to vote in favor of the pay package, Reuters reported. Vanguard's fund manager voted against the compensation package in 2018, the report said. For Musk and Tesla fans who made the journey to Texas for the meeting, the mood was celebratory. Some wore Cybertruck shirts to the event, and others signed a large banner emblazoned with the words \"Don't mess with Tesla retail shareholders.\" Tesla retail shareholders signing the \"Don't mess with Tesla retail shareholders\" sign at the event in Giga Texas today pic.twitter.com\/XISJcAb7ke After it became official that shareholders had reapproved his enormous pay package, Musk danced his way onto the stage, jumping up and down to the crowd's cheers. \"I just want to start off by saying hot damn! I love you guys,\" Musk said. Thursday's vote made one thing crystal clear: For many of Tesla's retail shareholders, the feeling is mutual. Most of the questions posed to Musk during the Q&A segment started with the shareholders singing their praises of the Tesla CEO. One shareholder started by saying, \"We love you so much, Elon.\" Another said he moved to Texas thanks to Musk. One shareholder referred to him as \"an absolute idol\" and asked if Musk was taking care of his safety and health, because he cared about Musk as a person. Musk ate it up. The CEO was in high spirits and even agreed on the spot to make a change a shareholder proposed, offering to allow Tesla owners to transfer its Full Self-Driving package to new vehicles for one more quarter. Musk's tendency to make bold and ambitious promises, even if they shift, is part of what excites his fan base. His ability to achieve seemingly impossible goals, like the ones entailed in his performance-based compensation plan, has clearly fueled loyalty and passion for his vision.

At the time, the palace did not share further details about the type of surgery Kate underwent and told the Associated Press that it was not cancer-related. However, in her video to the public, Kate revealed that in tests following the procedure, her medical team found that \"cancer had been present.\" She also said the results were a \"shock\" and that she and Prince William were doing what they could to \"process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family.\" \"As I have said to them, I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal in my mind, body, and spirits,\" Kate said in the video. In another press release shared with BI, Kensington Palace said that she would be returning to work \"when she is cleared to do so by her medical team.\" Kate's return to the public eye follows her father-in-law's. Charles is also undergoing treatment for cancer, discovered after he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate in January. He first appeared in public in April when he attended an Easter church service. As sovereign, Charles will be taking part in this year's Trooping the Colour, Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC. However, the BBC reported he will likely join the festivities in a carriage instead of riding a horse like he did in 2023. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Here are 6 of her favorites.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/bethenny-frankel-tried-1-000-beauty-products-favorites-2024-6","description":"Bethenny Frankel is known for her honest beauty product reviews on TikTok. Here are some of her favorite ones, including drugstore picks.","date":"2024-06-14T17:15:44Z","content":"Bethenny Frankel first became famous from \"The Real Housewives of New York\" and her SkinnyGirl alcohol brand. But these days, she is just as well-known for her lucrative career as a TikTok influencer. Fans tune in to hear her dating advice or beef with Chanel, but most stay for her brutally honest takes on viral beauty products. Frankel told Business Insider that she's probably reviewed about one thousand products in the few years she's been active on the platform. She first got on TikTok because she wanted to learn how to do her own makeup. \"I didn't know that people were being paid, and I did not know that there were filters,\" she told BI. \"I spent probably $10-50,000 in that year on stuff because I thought that everyone was telling the truth.\" She eventually decided that most of the positive reviews were \"99.9% bullsh*t,\" particularly for the higher-end items. \"I didn't realize that everybody copies everybody, that every single brand copies Charlotte Tilbury or Drunk Elephant, and it's widely accepted in the beauty industry,\" she said. If you're looking for quality skincare products, \"the drugstore is every single bit as good as the luxury,\" she said. \"Hard Candy lip gloss is every bit as good as Dior. No stuttering, it really is.\" Frankel shared some of her all-time favorites, including drugstore picks. Frankel is a big fan of L'Oreal, which she's also partnered with. \"L'Oreal does the best job of any brand in bridging luxury and drugstore,\" she said. In particular, she loves the Revitalift SPF 50 sunscreen ($28) and Midnight Cream ($35), which she said is a \"good, rich, excellent cream\" and is popular for its anti-aging benefits. Frankel loves Bio-Oil body oil ($7), a product she recently spoke about on TikTok. She uses it as a body and hair oil because of how hydrating it feels. \"It's in every single drugstore, it's not expensive,\" Frankel said. To replicate a more high-end oil, she said \"you could add some lavender or some fragrance and make it yourself.\" When it comes to body lotions, Frankel's cycled through many affordable drugstore brands such as Palmer's ($7). \"I don't love the packaging, but it's inexpensive,\" she said. She's also a fan of Pond's, Vaseline, and Aquaphor. Another product Frankel recently mentioned on TikTok is Gerber's baby washcloth ($8 for a 6-pack), which she told BI is an excellent substitute for standard makeup remover wipes. She said adding some gentle soap and water \"will clean your face better than anything\" because it's gentle enough to be a baby product but \"has those grains that will exfoliate your skin.\" Another low-budget pick, Frankel told BI that Beekman 1802 \"has the best cuticle oil\" ($20) because of its easy sponge-tip applicator. She said on TikTok that it helps keep her nails from drying out when she travels. Frankel said she likes TruSkin's \"comprehensive range\" of serums and retinol, and particularly is hooked on its vitamin C serum ($39). Vitamin C is an antioxidant that has anti-aging benefits like fading fine lines and dark spots. TruSkin's version is on the lower-end, price-wise, and contains hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin.

I'm seriously considering Biden over the 'autocrat.'","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/nikki-haley-voter-trump-biden-gop-election-2024-6","description":"A self-described centrist Republican Nikki Haley voter said he just can't support Donald Trump again.","date":"2024-06-14T13:23:10Z","content":"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Roger, who is affiliated with the Haley Voters Working Group. The group is made up of primary supporters of former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley who are supporting President Joe Biden in the general election or considering it. He is identified only by his first name because of the sensitivities of his continuing work on defense policy. We've also included a statement from a spokesperson for former President Donald Trump at the bottom of the story. We are speaking to voters, officials, and others directly connected to politics this election cycle to get a first-person look at the stakes of this election. We fact-check their statements, vet our sources, and edit their responses for length and clarity. I voted for Donald Trump twice. It's clear now that his behavior is one of the greatest threats to the Constitution we've ever seen. But for a few words in the 14th Amendment, he wouldn't even be eligible to be a candidate. We're seeing it in real time. I don't want to be a part of that. We are not an autocracy. I don't know whether I can vote for Joe Biden. And yes, his age is a legitimate concern. Father Time is undefeated. But if I've got a choice between an autocrat and someone of his age, I'm not choosing the autocrat. No, sir, no, thank you. Trump began losing me when he started the shenanigans after he lost the 2020 election \u2014 all that weird stuff leading up to January 6, 2021. And if it hadn't been for then-Vice President Mike Pence, who is a great man, we would have been at a constitutional crossroads. The former president will say anything, and he'll do it with a straight face. He reminds me of P.T. Barnum; there's a sucker born every minute. You just have to do your research. He's done tremendous damage to himself. Not once has he accepted any accountability for the messes he's gotten himself into. Trump's a felon now, though I thought the New York case was the weakest one against him. Honestly, having handled classified documents in my military career, I looked at the list of things they found in the pool house and by the toilet. I was like, \"My goodness, he's in a heap of trouble here. You can't explain that away.\" He had multiple opportunities to gracefully return those documents. I don't like how Trump treated Nikki Haley: the name-calling, what he said about her husband when he was deployed. My goodness, he never finds the high ground. She's one of the smartest people you'll come around who understands all these issues. But she doesn't play to the left; MAGA hates her. I was stung when she endorsed him. I had to give it a little bit of reflection. I've watched the video several times. She has to remain politically viable moving forward. She is fundamentally a Republican. In the big picture, she never pretended that she was anything else. And she said that it was her personal choice. She gave the caveat in there that she encouraged him to reach out to his voters. In retrospect, he's had all this time to reach out to the over 4 million Haley voters. He's never done it. The Biden campaign has. I never liked Trump's tone or the way he behaved, but I did vote for him because I thought he was right about the border. His fiscal policies were mostly sound. The border is a real issue. There are many of us who believe that this issue began in January 2021 after Biden was sworn in, because he turned around and canceled all of Trump's executive orders and policies. You have to understand the bigger picture here. The effect of flooding in these undocumented immigrants brings the border to New York City, Chicago, Detroit, and Atlanta. It brings the border everywhere because we are not vetting these people. I'm an old-school Reagan fan, and Haley is a genuine Republican. She understands the importance of Ukraine. She understands the importance of how we project our foreign policy. And if you think about it, there's a lot of crossover there that the current administration is trying to do. Trump being elected would be a disaster for Ukraine. Forty-six Republicans voted against funding NATO \u2014 that scares the devil out of me. It's like no one is paying attention to the things that are really important. We want democracy, we want liberty, and we want freedom to flourish, because that's what true American values are. We don't want to send American troops to fight over there. I met my wife during my first tour in Korea. We've been married 35 years now. The military is a microcosm of our society as a whole. Growing up in rural South Carolina, I learned a lot about people by working beside them. It gets you away from a myopic way of thinking. One of my assignments took me to the DMZ. You come face-to-face with North Korea. You see them living in the past. They come out in these old woolen Soviet uniforms. It's very stark there. You sort of understand the dangers in the world. After Russia invaded Ukraine, it got me. You look on a map, you can tell what the stakes are. There's nothing good coming from Russian aggression. So that's what drew me into being involved, adding my voice and perspective to the mix. In response to Roger's comments, Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, sent the following statement to Business Insider: \"President Trump dominated the primary in record-breaking fashion and it wasn't even close. Voters know that President Trump is the only person who will beat Joe Biden and take back the White House. It was revealed that investigators in that case likely engaged in evidence tampering and mishandling of those documents, which is why a filing was made earlier this week to dismiss the case. Joe Biden being elected again would be a disaster for America. President Trump will put America First instead of getting into more wars and more conflict like Biden has done.\" (Editor's note: The special counsel Jack Smith's team has said the order of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago during the classified-documents investigation may have shifted from when FBI agents originally seized the materials.)

Fans are eager to understand the time-telling motifs, and businesses are cashing in on the craze.","date":"2024-06-14T21:34:57Z","content":"There's much more to being a Taylor Swift fan than memorizing new albums and spending thousands of dollars on concert tickets. Swifties must also be on high alert whenever the musician nods to old-school clocks. Since releasing \"Midnights\" in 2022 and \"The Tortured Poets Department\" this year, Swift has been noticeably intertwining time into her musical work. But the Grammy-winning superstar hasn't gone digital \u2014 even in a world of iPhones, Apple Watches, and AI. Instead, the musician has almost exclusively utilized analog technology \u2014 a choice that's made a noticeable impact on businesses and her younger fans. Time has always held a prominent place in Swift's art. Lyrically, she began singing about meaningful moments on her debut album. You might remember lyrics like \"2 a.m. riding in your truck\" from the fan-favorite track \"Mary's Song (Oh My My My).\" But Swift introduced time as a theme more heavily in 2022 and 2023 following the release of her 10th studio album. During the \"Midnights\" era, Swift used clock motifs throughout the \"Bejeweled\" music video, prominently featured them in her massive Eras Tour, and included some as (still-undecoded) Easter eggs, or hidden clues, in her \"Karma\" and \"Lavender Haze\" music videos. Then, when she was nominated for six Grammys this year, Swift arrived on the event's red carpet wearing a diamond-encrusted watch custom-made into a choker. The Lorraine Schwartz timepiece was a playful nod to her nominated work and a subtle reference to a new project she'd announce that night: her 11th studio album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" But then Swift wore the necklace again, this time while out with friends in Notting Hill on Tuesday night. And fans think the \"Anti-Hero\" singer is up to something because of it. Swiftie or not, you've probably noticed that most things Swift touches turn to gold. She brought major attention to small Kansas City businesses during the latest NFL season, and her tour has boosted economies around the globe. And that's not to mention Swift's impact on the rebirth of vinyl records. Forbes reported that \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" was the highest-selling vinyl of 2023 with 1.4 million copies, and \"The Tortured Poets Department\" broke the record for largest vinyl sales \u2014 more than 700,000 copies \u2014 in a single week. These feats partially result from a popular tactic in which artists release multiple vinyl variants of their albums to boost revenue. Swift has been leading the charge. Naturally, Swift has also impacted the world of telling time. Look no further than entrepreneur Victoria P., who created her watch-focused jewelry brand, Joiedevika, two years ago. She first sold her handmade, time-telling necklaces at Los Angeles flea markets. As her designs became more popular, her business expanded to Etsy, Depop, and a personal website. Speaking with Business Insider, Victoria said friends texted her when they saw Swift wearing a watch necklace at the 2024 Grammys. And instantly, orders came pouring in. \"I Googled 'watch necklace Taylor Swift,' and I found necklaces from my Etsy shop,\" she said. Victoria noted that her online shops have received a big boost in recent months, with her Etsy sales this year already surpassing her total for 2023. \"I have a lot of customers asking me for watch necklaces to wear to Taylor Swift parties and events. It's very interesting,\" she told BI. And she's not the only one. Eugena Lee of Eugena's Jewelry told BI that her watch necklaces have been especially popular this year. Avery Borders also said she'd noticed the \"Taylor Swift Effect\" on her small business, Mundus Magica Creations. \"I've seen a few whispers of steampunk elements in the fashion industry lately,\" Borders told BI. \"But Taylor wearing a watch necklace has been super cool. I've seen a boost in sales, a boost in interest, and a boost in inspiration on my end.\" A post shared by JOIEDEVIKA (@joiedevika) Swift has also made some cash on clock-themed merchandise. She previously sold a \"Folklore\"-themed clock and a \"Lover\"-themed watch as official merchandise, and four of the \"Midnights\" vinyl variants she released created a clock when displayed together. Brittany Cheshire, a 31-year-old Swiftie from Arizona, spent $120 on the four records. And no, she doesn't own a record player. \"I was moving into my new house and I was excited to decorate the walls in my office,\" she told BI. \"I needed a clock, and what's better than a Taylor one?\" She also purchased a $50 display set from Swift's official merchandise website, which allows fans to mount the albums on a wall and turn them into functional clocks. \"I totally understand that it's four of the same album. But for me, it's more about the artwork,\" Cheshire added. \"I have all four variants of 'The Tortured Poets Department' on my wall, too. The photos, the composition, everything is beautiful. I'm not just a crazy super Swiftie who has to have everything she puts out.\" But maybe more importantly, Swift has inadvertently helped young people learn to read analog clocks \u2014 something they've long been accused of not knowing how to do, even by Jimmy Kimmel. \"That's it! I'm learning to tell time! Gimme!\" one TikToker commented on a video Swift posted about her clock vinyl variants. \"From teaching about spelling to telling the time, it's official! Taylor Swift is the best teacher you could ever ask for,\" another fan wrote on X. from teaching about spelling to telling the time, it\u2019s official! taylor swift is the best teacher you could ever ask for. \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/lgHA3Kb5W7 So what exactly is Swift saying by wearing her sparkling watch necklace again? Dedicated fans are scouring the internet for answers, with one woman saying she emailed a journalist to request that they check high-resolution photos to see what numbers Swift had her timepiece necklace set to. The answer remains unclear, and only time \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 will tell. But Swifties are determined to beat the clock. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

But Apple and Google had for months been working together behind the scenes, with Google giving Apple access to its data centers to train the iPhone maker's new AI models. For years, Apple has leaned on Google's and Amazon's cloud services to store data for its products. For example, when Apple-device users do iCloud backups, they're often stored in Google's data centers. It's not a deal that either company tends to talk about, but it gets Apple access to thousands of Google's machines, helping it provide many of the software features iPhone users love and rely on. When it came to training the AI models that power the iPhone maker's new Apple Intelligence, the company asked for additional access to Google's Tensor Processing Units for training. TPUs are chips specifically designed for artificial intelligence, and Google rents these out via its cloud service as an alternative to Nvidia graphics processing units. Apple's request created a scramble inside Google in April, when Googlers became aware of technical issues that could've stopped them from delivering what Apple wanted on time. It was known internally as an \"OMG,\" a Google term for one-off urgent incidents that don't quite warrant a code red. A war room was convened inside Google, according to a person with direct knowledge of the incident. The team delivered for Apple after a few very long days, the person said. But it was a close call that could've been bad news for Apple, which has earned the nickname Bigfoot among Google Cloud employees because of how much of Google's data centers it uses. Spokespeople for Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The partnership underscores how far behind Apple still is in the generative-AI race. Most of the impressive features of AI models must be at least partly handled in massive, energy-sucking data centers, which companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have spent years building. As a result, Apple is having to lean more heavily on these rivals as it tiptoes into the AI race. As some eagle-eyed Apple watchers spotted, Apple's technical documentation hints at the Google partnership, with a mention that its AI models were trained using a combination of methods, \"including TPUs and both cloud and on-premise GPUs.\" When users try out Apple's new AI features, much of the work will happen on the device itself. More intensive tasks will be handed off to what Apple is saying are special data centers running new Apple-designed silicon. Where these servers are remains unclear. But Apple is faced with a new reality where cloud computing and the chips to train AI models are a hot commodity, forcing it to tap partners that it also competes against. For example, Apple's deal with OpenAI will give users access to a more-advanced chatbot than Apple can offer in the form of ChatGPT. It's also a boon for OpenAI, which gets new access to Apple's vast user base. The AI wars are forcing tech companies to forge these crucial, sometimes unexpected, relationships. On Tuesday, Microsoft and Oracle announced a deal to give Microsoft access to Oracle's cloud servers for handling some OpenAI workloads. Previously, OpenAI ran exclusively on Microsoft's servers. Bloomberg previously reported that Google and Apple were also in talks to bring Google's Gemini AI to iOS devices. A deal has not materialized, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. Speaking in an interview after the WWDC keynote, the Apple executive Craig Federighi made it clear that Apple was open for business when it comes to AI partners, and even name-checked Google. \"We want to enable users ultimately to choose the models they want, maybe Google Gemini in the future,\" he said. \"Nothing to announce right now.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Here's everything fans can expect.","date":"2024-06-14T18:54:02Z","content":"All good things must come to an end, including Prime Video's popular superhero satire series \"The Boys.\" The show was officially renewed for a fifth season back in May. Then on Tuesday, two days before the the season four premiere, creator and showrunner Eric Kripke revealed via X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram that the upcoming fifth season would be the show's last. \"#TheBoys Season 4 Premiere Week is the perfect time to announce: Season 5 will be the Final Season! Which was always my plan, I just had to be cagey about it until I got final permission from @voughtintl,'\" Kripke wrote on Instagram. \"But I'm thrilled to bring this story to a gory, epic, emotional climax. So check out Season 4, premiering THIS THURSDAY, because the end has begun! Hop in for the ride. Which will be bumpy. And probably a little moist. @theboystv @primevideo.\" Here's everything we know about season five of \"The Boys,\" so far. So far, season four has explored the characters' biggest fears and unresolved traumas. Kripke compared the show to a three-act film and said that season four serves as act two. \"It's like the darkest point, the most introspective point,\" he told Deadline. \"It's the one where the characters have to emotionally face their existential trauma. So then they're able to jump onto the roller coaster ride that is the climax of the movie.\" Kripke told Deadline that the writers' room spent weeks discussing the show's mythology and broad ideas for season five, and he has a good idea of how the series will conclude. \"I know that moment where the title card comes up and it says six months later, and you see where everybody is,\" he said. \"I know that. I can really write the last 10 pages of this story right now.\" He explained to The Hollywood Reporter that everything isn't mapped out in detail yet because he wants to create room for the writers to suggest ideas and twists. \"I don't totally know how we're going to get there, but I know the destination,\" he said. \"The Boys\" juggles many characters and storylines, but the heart of the show is the dynamic between sworn enemies Butcher (Karl Urban) and Homelander (Antony Starr). Homelander already teased a \"scorched\" earth\" destiny for him and Butcher in the season three premiere. It looks like fans will likely see that play out in season five. \"The show is a serialized story that is about Butcher and Homelander slowly crashing into each other, and the show doesn't work without either of those,\" Kripke told The Hollywood Reporter. \"So, you just can't keep that going on forever, you have to let them smash into each other.\" \"What I would say is, this particular story is ending, the Butcher-Homelander is ending,\" he told Variety. \"But there can be other stories and other corners of the universe.\" There are already various \"Boys\" offshoots in different stages; the college-set \"Gen V\" was renewed for a second season in October and a Mexico spin-off is in the works. But the upcoming fifth season of \"The Boys\" will be the end of the road for the show. \"This story of 'The Boys' will not continue on,\" Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, adding that there are some other potential spin-offs in development that have yet to be announced. \"It's not totally locked in yet, but we are going to start shooting around mid-November,\" Kripke told Variety. \"And I don't know when it'll premiere yet, but we'll be shooting well into middle of '25.\" The showrunner added that, like past seasons, the final installment will be comprised of eight episodes. Since season five is anticipated to film through 2025, that means it likely won't premiere until 2026. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Here's what what went down with Melinda Berry.","date":"2024-06-14T14:51:53Z","content":"The strongest couple in \"Perfect Match\" season two is under threat in the latest episodes after Harry Jowsey was accused of kissing another contestant. Since episode three, Harry has been obsessed with Jessica Vestal, and the pair has become one of the more consistent couples of the season. Harry has said on multiple occasions that he wants to marry Jessica. But in episode eight, Harry seems to return to his playboy ways when the male contestants are gifted with a boys only party. When they get to their destination, they are joined by a group of female contestants who are trying to tempt men away from their original partners. This is a new addition to \"Perfect Match\" and could be an attempt by the producers to replicate the Casa Amor format from \"Love Island.\" It tests contestants' loyalty and adds more drama to reality dating series. It's a success, immediately creating tension in four of the five original couples. Harry and Melinda Berry, who was eliminated in episode 7, begin flirting with each other, and Harry offers to carry her twice. The second time is when Harry allegedly kisses Melinda. The \"kiss\" apparently happens off-camera, turning the incident into an argument between Melinda, who is adamant that the kiss happened, and Harry, who says it didn't. The next day, Melinda tells Jessica that she and Harry kissed, causing a big fight between the three contestants. Here's what we know so far about the kissing scandal between Melinda and Harry. Frustratingly, \"Perfect Match\" never reveals if the kiss happens in the episodes released on June 14. Either it occurred off-camera or the producers have decided to withhold the footage. But we do have some potential witnesses. In episode eight, Holly Scarfone and Justin Assada were talking to each other right next to where the kiss is thought to have happened. Holly is actually the first person to claim they kissed. Justin says: \"Woah, what's going on there? huh\" Holly replies: \"Boys' day. They kissed.\" The camera also pivots to Stevan Ditter, who seems to be looking in the direction of Harry and Melinda. Stevan and Justin both say they didn't see anything, though they could be trying to defend their friend. The camera then goes back to Melinda and Harry, and Harry begins to talk about his great relationship with Jessica. When Melinda mentions the kiss, Harry denies it, laughs without looking directly at her, and walks away. Harry doubles down when they get to the rest of the group, saying that Melinda is making up the kiss to boost her fame. \"No one saw it,\" he tells the rest of the group. \"That was fake news. I did not kiss her. Where's the video evidence?\" Later in the episode, the original couples return to the house, and Jessica finds Harry crying in his bed. Harry tells Jessica he hasn't been the best example for her or her daughter Autumn. Harry says he was too playful during the boys' party and carried Melinda to the toilet at one point in the day. Harry never mentions a kiss and instead accuses Melinda of trying to lie about what happened earlier in the day. Jessica and Harry have a brief argument, as she doesn't initially believe him but Jessica eventually forgives him. At the end of episode eight, the female contestants from the \"boys' party\" arrive in the house to give them an opportunity to steal any of the men. All the women decide to congregate around a table to reveal if any of the men cheated during the boys' day out. Melinda immediately tells Jessica that she and Harry kissed three times the day before. \"He just kissed me,\" Melinda says. \"And then does it again, so I kissed him back.\" Harry and Dom Gabriel walk past, so Jessica asks Harry to comment on Melinda's story. Harry again denies kissing Melinda, saying that no one saw anything. Melinda then turns to Brittan Byrd, who was nearby during the incident, to support her claim. Brittan says Melinda's makeup was on his nose. Jessica begins questioning Melinda's motives for kissing Harry and not telling her this information privately. The pair argue over this for a minute before Jessica says she will ask for both sides of the story before deciding whether to stay with Harry. Meanwhile, Harry walks away and complains about the situation to Dom. Harry tells Dom that Melinda set up the conversation about the kiss and says Melinda was the one who tried to initiate a kiss, but he turned away. Jessica spends most of episode nine asking multiple contestants about what she should do about the Harry situation. It is not the first time Harry's loyalty has been questioned. Harry has a poor dating track record, and multiple contestants have brought this up to Jessica. Jessica speaks to Alara Taneri, Stevan, Dom, and Bryton Constantin, who all defend Harry. Jessica also speaks to Harry for his side of the story. Harry denies the kiss but adds another element to the story. \"I did look at her stomach, and I said, 'It'd look good if you were pregnant.' But it was not in that sense,\" Harry says. When Melinda speaks to Jessica privately later in the episode, Melinda says Harry wanted to have sex with her. \"He was like, 'I'm 30 years old. I'm ready for some babies.' He goes, 'You ready for some babies? I'll put a baby in you,'\" Melinda says. \"He goes, 'They'll come out handsome and tall and athletic.'\" Harry and Jessica sit down again at the end of the episode to discuss the kissing incident. Harry says he has been vomiting all evening because of the stress of the situation and apologizes again for the incident. However, Jessica is still not convinced Harry is telling the whole truth. The episode ends with Harry making another plea for Jessica to match with him. \"Perfect Match\" fans will likely find out Jessica's decision when the season two finale premieres on Netflix on June 21.

With this in mind, they wanted to identify lifestyle factors that could help people avoid problems associated with aging, such as chronic illnesses, cognitive decline, and physical limitations. The researchers defined healthy aging as being free of chronic diseases and problems with physical function, memory, or mental health at age 70. The study was published in the journal JAMA Network Open on Tuesday. It used data collected across 20 years from 45,176 female participants of the Nurses' Health Study, an investigation into the risk factors of chronic diseases in women. Researchers compared the time participants spent watching TV and doing physical activity in an average week. The team found that those who spent more time watching TV were less likely to age healthily. For every two hours participants spent watching TV, their odds of healthy aging decreased by 12%. But the more time participants spent doing physical activity, the higher their odds of aging healthily. Every two hours of walking or standing they did each day was linked to a 12% higher chance of aging healthily. And the more intense the physical activity, the more their odds increased. Even just replacing one hour of being sedentary while watching TV with one hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity \u2014 such as walking at a normal pace \u2014 each day was associated with 28% higher odds of healthy aging. From the study's findings, researchers identified four lifestyle factors that could help people become healthy: watching less than three hours of TV a day, walking or standing for at least three hours a day, doing at least 30 minutes a day of more intense activity like walking at a normal pace, and not being overweight. They also found that participants who slept for fewer than seven hours each night could improve their odds of healthy aging by replacing TV time with sleep. It's important to note that the findings of this study are not causal, meaning that researchers can't say for sure that watching TV causes unhealthy aging. But the researchers pointed out that sitting for long periods has been linked to reduced insulin sensitivity, increased inflammation, and reduced blood flow to the brain, while sitting in front of the TV specifically has been associated with unhealthy eating patterns, including overeating, which increases the risk of disease. Since the study was done on a cohort of US nurses, the findings may not be the same for other demographics, the researchers added. Professor Dan Belsky, an epidemiologist at the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center, told Business Insider that this study \"contributes additional data\" to findings that have been known for a long time, that \"people who report being more active also report better health outcomes.\" He said: \"What is needed now are studies to identify community- and society-level strategies that enable more people to be more active.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Several demography experts told Business Insider that these involved lump sums of money, gold medals, and even tax breaks. But none will be enough to solve the problem alone, they said. Several countries have introduced so-called baby bonuses to combat declining fertility rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore offered one-time payments, and the \"Baby Bonus Scheme\" continues to provide cash incentives for Singaporean couples having children. South Korea, which has the world's lowest fertility rate, runs an allowance system that gives parents with a newborn $750 a month until their baby turns 1 year old. According to Bloomberg, the country is even considering a proposal to pay families about $70,000 to have children. Local Chinese governments, meanwhile, offer one-time subsidies, often worth thousands of dollars, to encourage parents to have two or more children. However, experts say that financial incentives alone are not a long-term solution. Sarah Harper, a professor of gerontology and the director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, told BI that cash incentives encouraged a \"mini baby boom, followed by a baby crash.\" She added: \"Those women who would have spread their childbearing across several years all go at the same time to get the cash bonus, and then there is a lull in childbearing.\" Other financial incentives include Kazakhstan's prize system for mothers with many children, inspired by the \"mother heroine\" honorary title from the Soviet era. BBC WorkLife reported that mothers in the country received silver medals for six children, gold medals for seven or more, and a financial allowance for the rest of their lives. In 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced a similar program, offering a title and a lump sum of about $17,000 to Russian citizens with 10 or more children. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has also focused on boosting the fertility rate with financial perks. Women in Hungary who become mothers under 30 or have four or more children receive a lifelong exemption from paying personal income tax. Meanwhile, Hungarian families with three or more children receive subsidies for purchasing seven-seater cars, The Associated Press reported, and parents get loan deductions on their homes based on the number of children they have. Trent MacNamara, a Texas A&M professor whose work has focused on fertility rates, told BI that the impact of financial incentives on fertility rates was uncertain and might lead to only modest gains. \"For example, if a government transferred new parents about 5% of the costs of raising a child, we could expect a roughly 5% bump in fertility,\" he said. Financial incentives often have an underlying assumption that the cost of parenting is the main reason behind declining fertility rates. However, Poh Lin Tan, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, told BI that \"an amalgam of factors\" pushes people to have fewer children. In Singapore, these factors include people spending more time in education, changes to traditional family dynamics, and the conflict between building a family and a career, she said. In 2023, Singapore attempted to address some underlying factors by doubling paid paternity leave to four weeks and increasing unpaid infant-care leave from six to 12 days annually for a child's first two years. Scandinavian countries have gone even further. Norway provides 49 weeks of parental leave with full pay, Finland offers seven months to each parent, and Sweden provides 240 days per parent of leave. But Philip N. Cohen, a family demographer at the University of Maryland, told BI that these policies often have unintended effects. He said that in some circumstances, parents don't end up having more kids; instead, they use generous leave provisions like paid time off and universal childcare to space out having fewer children so they benefit more. Cohen said that other strategies to increase fertility rates included countries like Israel offering free or heavily subsidized in vitro fertilization. According to the American Economic Association, this may have also had an unintended consequence \u2014 leading Jewish Israeli women to delay getting married and having kids. Hungary also offers free IVF as part of its pronatalist policies, and Singapore and Japan offer significant subsidies. However, a 2020 essay by Tan said the Japanese example showed that reproductive technologies were not a panacea for low fertility rates. Japan has the world's highest percentage of babies born through IVF, yet it has one of the lowest fertility rates, she said. South Korea also covers the costs of various reproductive-technology treatments, such as egg freezing. More recently, Seoul's government made headlines with a proposal offering up to $730 each to 100 people to reverse their vasectomies or untie their tubes. Experts agreed that there's no easy solution to the fertility crisis. \"No government has discovered a policy that produces sustained bumps in fertility,\" MacNamara told BI, adding: \"Plenty of bright people in wealthy countries have spent decades trying to figure this out without evident success.\" He said that young people increasingly saw small families as the norm, which is a \"really tough cycle to break.\" Even if a \"magic formula\" were to be discovered, he added, it would need to be implemented carefully to avoid then promoting unsustainable population growth. \"Rapid growth would make it harder to scale back our present overconsumption of resources, including fossil fuels,\" he said.

With criminal convictions on both sides of the election campaign, it's a lose-lose situation, says Andrew Payne, the author of \"War on the Ballot: How the Election Cycle Shapes Presidential Decision-Making in War.\" On Tuesday, Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden was found guilty of three federal charges related to the purchase of a gun while he was using illegal drugs. His conviction came less than two weeks after Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 counts related to falsifying business records before the general election in 2016. Hunter Biden was the first child of a sitting president to be criminally convicted, while Trump was the first US president to be criminally convicted. Speaking to Business Insider, Payne said the historic convictions had \"significantly damaged\" the US's reputation on the world stage. The presidential candidates had contrasting reactions to each conviction. While Trump told reporters his trial was \"rigged,\" Joe Biden said he'd accept the outcome of his son's legal woes. Trump used the publicity from his trial to capitalize on fundraising opportunities. Shortly after his guilty verdict was announced, his donor website crashed, a spokesperson wrote on X. A person with knowledge of the Trump campaign who spoke to The New York Times said the campaign had hoped Hunter Biden would be acquitted during his trial, as it would prove the narrative that Trump was a victim of political persecution \u2014 and would probably raise millions of dollars from supporters. John Zogby, a veteran pollster, told The Guardian that Hunter Biden's guilty verdict could be a \"marginal political gain\" for the president and that his decision not to pardon his son would be seen positively. \"It pulls the rug out from under that Republican argument that the justice system is rigged against Republicans to get Trump,\" Zogby said, adding, \"A Biden did not get a pass.\" Hunter Biden's conviction might be slightly beneficial to his father's campaign, Zogby said, though it wouldn't \"move mountains.\" Payne said that in contrast, it was likely to further damage the US's reputation, which took a significant hit when Trump was convicted. \"It is hardly a ringing endorsement of the health of democracy in the United States that allegations of the politicization of the judicial system or questions about candidates' commitment to the rule of law feature so prominently in the campaign,\" Payne said. If Joe Biden were to be elected, he might attempt to rebuild the US as \"an example of a country where no one is above the law,\" Payne said. But as the president's approval rating reached a record low this week, his future in The White House is unknown. On Monday, FiveThirtyEight's weighted tracker recorded a 37.4% approval rating for Joe Biden, compared with 41.6% for Trump. Neither candidate is considered hugely popular, with an April Pew Research Centre survey suggesting that 49% of voters would replace both candidates if they could. This makes the upcoming election particularly difficult to call. \"Even if Trump isn't elected, when you have one of the two major presidential candidates and someone who is a former president who carries a criminal conviction, it kind of undermines your case that the democratic system is superior,\" Payne said. \"So there's a big undermining of the US brand, irrespective of whoever is elected in November,\" he added. Representatives for The White House and the respective Biden and Trump campaigns didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Since April, year-over-year visit trends to fast-food chains in the Golden State have lagged behind national trends, suggesting that diners could be put off by the higher menu prices, per data from Placer.ai, which tracks foot traffic analytics. \"It's clear that the menu price increase is having an impact,\" R.J. Hottovy, Placer.ai's head of analytical research, wrote in a report. According to the data, the year-over-year change in the number of visits to fast-food chains in California across February and March was slightly higher than the national average. \"However, this abruptly shifted when the minimum wage increase went into effect,\" Hottovy wrote in the report, noting that traffic to fast-food chains in California had been weaker than the national average in seven of the eight weeks in April and May. California raised its minimum wage for workers at limited-service restaurants to $20 an hour on April 1. The legislation applies to chains with at least 60 locations nationwide and has faced fierce opposition from the fast-food industry. To offset their higher labor costs, restaurants have raised prices, turned to technology and automation like order kiosks, and considered reducing their opening hours. Some pizza restaurants have even laid off delivery workers. Year-over-year visits to McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's restaurants in California trended well behind the chains' national averages in April and May, according to Placer.ai's data. Jack in the Box and In-N-Out also underperformed on foot traffic in California compared to their national averages, per the data. A Jack in the Box spokesperson previously told Business Insider that at its company-owned locations in California, it had raised menu prices by between 6% and 8% in response to the minimum wage change. In-N-Out told KTVU that it had raised prices \"incrementally\" on April 1. The data has to be taken with a pinch of salt, however. After all, it only measures footfall, not delivery orders or the size of in-person orders. And there could be other factors, other than menu price increases, deterring diners. But Placer.ai's research indicates that the legislation does appear to be having at least some impact on the number of customers visiting fast-food spots in the state, especially when restaurant chains are cagey about sharing their own data showing the effects of their price hikes. The legislation was introduced to help workers cope with the state's rising living costs, though many fast-food franchisees have questioned why the wage only applies to their industry. Some fast-food executives, however, say it could make jobs in the industry more desirable and mean they have better-quality candidates. Californian residents are divided: Some acknowledge that fast food is a tough gig and support the new minimum wage, while others say it will push prices up too much.

The famed short-seller and Tesla bear told Bloomberg on Wednesday that 2021 was the \"most speculative market\" he'd seen in four decades of investing \u2014 and \"we're getting back to that.\" \"Not quite there, but it's close,\" Chanos continued. He pointed to the resurgence of meme stocks such as GameStop, special-purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) and the \"absolutely insane valuations\" of some restaurant chains. The Chanos & Co boss is best known for rooting out fraud at companies including Enron and Wirecard, then betting against them. But he's since converted his hedge fund into a family office after several years of underperformance. The Wall Street veteran warned retail investors against blindly following the crowd and buying the latest hot asset with no fundamentals to support its sky-high valuation. He emphasized that kind of FOMO-style trading was a \"disaster\" for them in 2021. While Chanos has repeatedly bet against Tesla, he said the EV maker should honor Musk's compensation deal from 2018 as the CEO hit all his performance targets. Several Tesla investors have blasted the payout as excessive and sued to stop it, and the result of a shareholder vote on the package was due Thursday. \"Even though I'm a bear on Tesla, I think a deal's a deal even if it's a bad deal, and they agreed to it,\" Chanos said. He added that while he's \"not a big fan of Elon,\" that doesn't change the fact that Musk achieved the goals he was set. However, Chanos did underscore that the deal was \"very expensive\" for shareholders and exceeded all the retained earnings Tesla has ever generated. He also questioned what Musk could demand next if he does get his way. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

Investors don't seem to care.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/china-electric-vehicles-share-price-europe-tariff-hike-overcapacity-investors-2024-6","description":"Share prices of most Chinese electric vehicles surged on Thursday.","date":"2024-06-13T09:02:51Z","content":"The European Commission, or EC, announced it will be slapping hefty tariffs on China's electric vehicle imports \u2014 but most investors seem unfazed. On Wednesday, the EC said it will impose tariffs of up to 38.1% on Chinese EV imports from next month \u2014 on top of existing 10% duties. All Chinese EV imports will be subject to additional tariffs from next month, but the commission singled out three major EV makers: BYD, Geely, and SAIC. BYD will be subject to an additional 17.4% in duties, while Geely will pay an extra 20%. State-backed SAIC will be subject to additional levies of 38.1%. On Thursday \u2014 less than a day after EC dropped its bombshell announcement \u2014 the shares of most Chinese EV automakers were up. EV giant BYD was surging as much as 8.8% in Hong Kong, while Geely gained as much as 2.4%. The shares of EV startups Nio and Li Auto were also higher. Shanghai-listed SAIC was an outlier in Thursday's Chinese stock rally, declining by as much as 3%. The unlikely rally for most Chinese EV companies appears to stem from the perception that the European Union's tariffs were \"modest,\" as Vincent Sun, an equity analyst at Morningstar, wrote in a note on Wednesday. After all, US President Joe Biden's administration is levying a 100% tax on Chinese EVs. BYD, one of the world's largest EV makers alongside Tesla, would be less impacted by the new EU tariffs than its peers, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joanna Chen said on Thursday. \"BYD will likely be able to absorb most of the burden from EU import duties, since its cars carry peer-beating profitability,\" said Chen. Even though the market indicates that the EU's tariff hike on Chinese EVs is manageable, Beijing is still extremely displeased. \"I would like to stress that the anti-subsidy probe is typical protectionism,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said of the EU's tariffs on Wednesday. \"To levy additional tariffs on EVs imported from China violates market economy principles and international trade rules, disrupts China-EU economic and trade cooperation and the global automotive industrial and supply chains and will eventually hurt Europe's own interests,\" said Lin. In recent months, Western countries have been lining up to criticize China for its barrage of cheap exports flooding the world's markets. They say China's dumping and unfair trade practices have hurt their economies. However, Beijing has consistently pushed back on the West's criticisms. Chinese authorities say the West's accusations are protectionist and aimed at containing China's economic growth. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

The deal, announced on Monday, involves integrating ChatGPT into Apple's operating systems. And boy, has it riled Musk up. Besides threatening to ban Apple's devices at his companies, Musk has also floated the possibility of getting either his social media company X or his EV giant Tesla to make a smartphone themselves. \"We could, but hopefully it isn't needed,\" Musk said in response to a Morgan Stanley analyst predicting that Tesla could make its own phone one day. \"Tesla is one of the few companies that has its own tech stack (not iOS, Android or forked Android,\" he continued. But Musk's full-throated condemnation of the Apple-OpenAI team-up may not be solely due to his misgivings toward OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. To be sure, Musk does have a long-running feud with Altman and OpenAI. Musk filed a lawsuit against the ChatGPT maker in February, accusing the company of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk might have dropped the lawsuit on Tuesday, but there's no evidence to suggest that that had anything to do with him wanting to bury the hatchet with Altman. Moreover, Musk's contempt for the Apple deal may stem from more practical considerations. For one, Apple seems open to cutting deals with Google for the use of Gemini, but xAI doesn't appear to have been part of those conversations just yet \u2014 if the WWDC keynote on Monday was anything to go by.  Bloomberg columnist Dave Lee called Apple a kingmaker in the AI race \u2014 and it's not hard to see why. For one, the Cupertino-based tech giant has over one billion iPhone users at its disposal. Such a massive user base would be a boon for any AI company looking to gain a foothold in the highly competitive field. In Musk's case, letting OpenAI grab the precious mindshare of Apple's users could prove to be a major blow to his AI company, xAI. This is because xAI doesn't have easy access to a wide-ranging consumer platform like OpenAI will soon own. OpenAI can now count on both Apple and Microsoft to promote its AI offerings to their user bases. Even Google, whose AI products have been hit with scathing reviews, can turn to its mobile operating system, Android, which boasts over three billion users. Musk still has X, but the social media platform averaged only 22 million daily active users in April, which pales in comparison to Apple's and Google's numbers. That said, one shouldn't rule out Musk and xAI just yet. The company said in late May that it raised $6 billion for its Series B funding round, giving it a total valuation of $24 billion. Altman's OpenAI, meanwhile, is worth around $80 billion. And while Musk might not have a product with iPhone-levels of popularity, he still has the \"Muskonomy\" to back him up. Musk's constellation of businesses, which includes Tesla and his satellite internet service Starlink, could give xAI the type of boost most AI startups can only dream of. Musk may have been preoccupied with the Tesla shareholder vote, but there's no telling when he will refocus his attention on xAI and fire the next salvo in the AI race. \"There will be more to announce in the coming weeks,\" Musk said on May 27, shortly after xAI's funding announcement. Representatives for Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI sent outside regular business hours. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Amid a torrent of bad publicity surrounding the artificial-intelligence startup OpenAI, the company's wunderkind CEO, Sam Altman, stays winning. The Information reported Wednesday that Altman recently told OpenAI staff the company's annualized revenue was $3.4 billion, and Bloomberg cited an unnamed source who confirmed this number. The startup's annualized revenue was $1.6 billion in late 2023, The Information previously reported. The company's rapid growth suggests OpenAI is still the gold standard for AI innovation even as competition heats up in the sector. OpenAI was most recently valued at about $86 billion. A representative for OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider but told The Information the reported financial details were \"inaccurate\" without offering further information. Altman told employees that while the majority of OpenAI's revenue was coming from subscriptions to its chatbots, the company was also pocketing money from its Microsoft partnership, which was bringing in about $200 million annually, The Information reported. Reporting on OpenAI's revenue growth came just two days after Apple announced an anticipated AI partnership with the company. The collaboration is set to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT with Apple's new and improved Siri feature, introducing the chatbot to billions of devices if users opt in to the integration. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that neither company was expected to make direct revenue as a result of the agreement; people familiar with the deal said Apple thought introducing OpenAI technology to its devices was a fair enough price to pay. Following Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, BI's Alex Bitter posited that Altman was the real winner of the global tech conference. The Apple partnership represents a huge endorsement of both OpenAI and Altman at a time when the startup is facing scrutiny over its commitment to safety. Earlier this month, a group of current and former OpenAI employees went public in a New York Times report with concerns about the company's financial motivations and approach to safety. The whistleblowers accused OpenAI of making false promises over its commitment to developing responsible AI, suggesting the company had prioritized growth and profits over safety. Multiple high-profile employees have also left OpenAI in recent months, including Jan Leike, who oversaw the company's superalignment strategy, and the chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, who expressed concerns about Altman's leadership last year, reports say. OpenAI has also found itself entangled in conflict with the Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson, who skewered the company for launching a new AI model with a voice that sounded suspiciously like hers. The company denied that it meant to impersonate Johansson's voice, but the similarities were stark, and Altman exacerbated the situation by posting \"her\" on X in an apparent reference to the 2013 film by the same name in which Johansson voices an AI virtual assistant. But even as controversy swirls around OpenAI, the company keeps racking up wins. Maribel Lopez, an AI analyst who founded the research and strategy consulting firm Lopez Research, attributed Altman's Teflon-like success to a series of smart business decisions the 39-year-old CEO has made. \"OpenAI was largely ahead on foundation models. They're perceived as having had it longer and doing it well,\" Lopez told BI, referring to the company's GPT models. \"The second reason is their relationship with Microsoft, which gives people confidence that they might be enterprise-ready,\" Lopez added, referencing the standard that many models must meet for adoption. She said OpenAI's new partnership with Apple had only increased the company's reputation and power in the industry. On Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook praised OpenAI for ChatGPT's \"world knowledge,\" calling the company the \"best\" in the business. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

The retailer's 4,600 stores are supported by a network of 42 regional distribution centers \u2014 sprawling warehouses of up to 1.5 million square feet that typically employ about 1,000 workers, according to the logistics consultancy MWPVL. Of those 42 distribution centers, Walmart CFO John David Rainey said the company had 15 with \"some level of automation,\" which serve about 1,700 stores. Speaking at the Evercore ISI Consumer and Retail Conference on Wednesday, Rainey revealed an utterly bonkers statistic for when one of these facilities is fully dialed up. \"When we automate one of these DCs, we see roughly twice the throughput with half the head count,\" he said. \"And so the math on this is very, very compelling.\" Twice as much stuff with half as many staff is a fourfold increase in efficiency \u2014 compelling math, indeed. And more revenue per employee translates to higher profit margins. \"They're planning to add $130 billion of sales over the next five years on a flat head count,\" Corey Tarlowe, a Jefferies analyst, told Business Insider. \"AI and automation are going to be absolutely critical to their evolution.\" As Walmart's distribution-center and fulfillment-center capacity increases, it's starting to exceed the inventory Walmart actually owns, Rainey said. \"It gives us the opportunity to use that space for our third-party providers,\" the CFO said. \"A very exciting part of what's changed in our business over the recent quarters is the number of three-P sellers that are availing themselves of Walmart fulfillment services.\" A day earlier, at Oppenheimer's e-commerce conference, Walmart US CEO John Furner indicated how these lower costs fed into an e-commerce flywheel that's gaining momentum for the company. \"The cost of picking is coming down, the density of last-mile delivery has improved, so therefore the cost per unit continues to fall,\" Furner said. \"You put all that together, and we see a much better path than what we saw a few years ago.\" Furner also said the number or stores served by these automated warehouses is on track to double this year, and that the increased efficiency opens up new opportunities for employees to train and get hired for better jobs.

Musk was quick to celebrate the win: \"Hot damn! I love you guys,\" he said. At the event, Musk took to the stage to do a victory dance, but the company has only won its first battle. Despite investor approval, Musk won't get his pay package back just yet. The next step: Tesla must take the issue back to court. Musk's pay plan was initially approved in 2018 but was struck down by a Delaware judge in January after a Tesla shareholder filed a lawsuit alleging the agreement was \"beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment.\" Tesla has yet to disclose how many investors voted in favor of the proposal. The company also passed a proposal on Thursday to move its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, but that vote to move won't allow Tesla to sidestep the ruling quite yet. It's still up to the Delaware courts to decide whether the pay plan can be reinstated. \"The lawsuit in Delaware will continue,\" Ann Lipton, a business-law professor at Tulane University Law School, told Business Insider. \"The new vote was conducted while Tesla was still a Delaware company and is subject to Delaware law \u2014 a point that Tesla made in its SEC filings. So, it's now up to the Delaware courts to determine if the new vote actually does have a ratifying effect.\" Last month, Tesla reassured Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would not attempt to contest the ruling on Musk's pay elsewhere, for example, in a Texas court. Lipton added that regardless of how the judge decides to weigh the recent vote, the losing side would probably appeal, dragging the case on further. Dorothy Lund, a corporate-law professor at Columbia University, told BI it could take months for the issue to be resolved, as Tesla must first wait for McCormick to determine the legal fees in the case. But she said it was likely that Tesla would appeal the ruling, taking the case to the Delaware Supreme Court. \"Tesla hasn't officially decided to appeal but all signs are pointing to that,\" Lund said. \"They have a ways to go before Elon will be paid,\" she added. Anat Alon-Beck, a corporate-law expert at Case Western Reserve University, said the case was also likely to spawn additional lawsuits. Musk has been known to draw a fair share of lawsuits. On Thursday, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a separate lawsuit alleging Musk had been siphoning AI talent to another of his companies, xAI, instead of Tesla, which has its own AI initiatives. In January, McCormick ruled to void the pay plan because, she said, Musk had undue influence over the agreement given his close relationships with board members. When the compensation package was voided, it was estimated to be worth about $55 billion \u2014 making it the largest pay package ever to be awarded to a CEO. While Musk doesn't receive a salary at Tesla, his compensation is determined by Tesla's performance. It's structured around 12 tranches of stock options that are vested when Tesla hits specific targets over the course of 10 years. When the company passes each milestone, Musk receives stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. Tesla said it hit all 12 targets as of 2023.

The supe, who can breathe underwater and communicate with sea creatures, ended up taking the octopus home with him and continuing to have sexual relations with her \u2014 to the disgust of his wife, Cassandra (Katy Breier). The season four premiere of \"The Boys,\" released Thursday on Prime Video, reveals that The Deep is now divorced and dealing with allegations from Cassandra's biography, \"In 2 Deep: My Journey 2 Freedom.\" In an interview, The Deep denies having sexual relations with an octopus, and he later tells Vought employee Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) that the sea creature has been \"taken care of.\" But instead of getting rid of Ambrosius, The Deep stashes her away in a tank in his closet, carrying out a secret relationship with her. \"Once we decided that The Deep and Ambrosius were going to have this intense affair and we were going to be able to hear her, we just were like, we need the most British, Oscar-winningest, classiest actor we can possibly find for that part,\" showrunner Eric Kripke told BI. \"There's four of them in the world, and Tilda Swinton is one of them.\" \"The Boys\" team didn't have a personal connection to the Academy Award winner but reached out to her reps, and she was game to voice the eight-armed sea creature. \"She came into the booth for one long session, and I was there, and it was really a pinch-me moment watching this world-class, highest caliber actress say the most ridiculous shit as Ambrosius,\" Kripke said. After four seasons of playing The Deep, Crawford said that he's still impressed by the creativity and attention to detail the show's VFX team puts into crafting its creatures. \"I'm always doing little things like in the air, pushing off tentacles and stuff, and then to see them add that in and make it come to life\u2026\" Crawford said as Kripke chimed in to point out that Ambrosius also has a tiny figurine of The Deep in her tank to keep her entertained. \"The guys are brilliant. And even the Timothy thing, I had no idea what that was going to be and they make it look so good,\" Crawford said, referencing The Deep's other octopus companion from season three. \"So, it's always fun for me to see what's next.\" The first three episodes of season four of \"The Boys\" are now streaming on Prime Video, followed by a new episode each week, ending with the season finale on July 18.

But people familiar with the deal told Bloomberg that the iPhone maker wasn't paying OpenAI to use its product. They said that instead, Apple thought the new deal would bring OpenAI's technology closer to hundreds of millions of users and would be of equal or greater value than a cash payment. The sources also said, however, that this alliance between Apple and OpenAI wasn't expected to generate meaningful revenue for either company yet. The deal could still be a win for both parties. Apple, for one, would benefit from offering users access to an advanced AI chatbot. And OpenAI stands to reap the benefits of access to Apple's vast platform. Being integrated into devices means it's set to reach millions of Apple users, some of whom may upgrade to paid ChatGPT versions, access to which starts at $20 a month. Apple and OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. OpenAI may actually be getting a pretty good deal, considering that partnering with Apple doesn't often come free \u2014 Google paid the company $20 billion in 2022 to have its search engine be the default on iPhones and other Apple devices. OpenAI's access to Apple users is also fairly extensive. At its Worldwide Developer's Conference on Monday, Apple announced it would add ChatGPT to its iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. Users are set to have access to writing tools, document reading, and image generation without switching between apps. The tech giant also plans to integrate ChatGPT with Siri, the digital assistant built into Apple devices. Users can opt out of the integration and decide whether they want Siri to send their queries to ChatGPT. Apple's WWDC keynote, which also discussed its in-house Apple Intelligence offerings, provided relief to investors who worried the company was falling behind in the AI race. Analysts reacting to the OpenAI deal also predicted that the tie-up might dilute Apple's revenue, at least in the near term. For one, analysts at Bernstein wrote after the WWDC keynote that while revenue sharing could benefit both firms, \"some possible migration from traditional search queries\" might still affect Apple's returns on the investment. That said, Apple may also introduce similar partnerships with other chatbots. Craig Federighi, a top Apple executive, also said at the WWDC keynote that Apple was looking to cut a deal with Google to use its Gemini AI model. Bloomberg reported in March that Apple had also held talks with Anthropic for a potential chatbot deal. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

We give them each space to be who they are.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-to-parent-introverted-and-extroverted-kids-2024-6","description":"The author's daughters are 4 and 1 years old. The oldest is introverted and the youngest is extroverted. She plans activities for both to feel happy.","date":"2024-06-13T09:59:01Z","content":"\"I want to go home!\" my 4-year-old screamed as I held her in my lap. We were at a birthday party for her best friend. To be more specific, this little girl is also our next-door neighbor, and we were in their backyard \u2014 the one she plays in almost every day. In contrast, my 1-year-old laughed and clapped as she sat with a group of kids playing with bubbles. This isn't a new situation for me \u2014 my older daughter wilts around big groups of people while my younger daughter lights up in the presence of others. I'm sure I'm not the only parent with one introverted child and another extroverted one, but in those panicky moments where I have to cater to both of their social needs, it feels like taking one wrong step will end in disaster \u2014 also known as an epic tantrum. Fortunately, I relate to my daughters. I'm what they call an extroverted introvert \u2014 someone who enjoys socializing but still needs time to recharge afterward. And because I understand both sides of the extrovert\/introvert personality, I've developed ways to embrace their specific needs. Weekdays are easier for us to schedule activities catered to each of our kids. While my introvert is at preschool, my extrovert is signed up for a gym and music class. If we have a day without a class, I take her to the playground or another busy spot to fuel her up. For my introvert, after her day at school, I know she has to reset. So we opt for 1:1 playdates, art projects at home, or activities that don't have too much stimulation, like going for a bike ride or gardening. On the weekends, we make an effort to spend time together as a family. Instead of running them to extracurriculars or playdates, we try to prioritize the importance of our family unit. This can definitely include parts of the day spent with their friends or ours, but ultimately, we all recharge on the weekend. Part of this is so that we instill in them that time with us is important, and another is so that my husband (total introvert) and I (extroverted introvert) don't get burned out either. Of course I'd love to be able to control every situation so my kids feel nothing but bliss but, well, that's not realistic. There are weekends where we all have to go to a big event \u2014 like the neighbor's birthday party \u2014 or where it's pouring rain (the LA equivalent of the end of days) and we're stuck indoors. We've learned that when possible, having options for each kid makes a huge difference. So when my introvert needed to leave the birthday party, I took her back to the house while my husband stayed at the party with my extrovert. When my extrovert needs some stimulation, I'll take her out for an adventure at the zoo while my husband has a 1:1 movie date with our introvert. My hope is that my daughters know they are loved and respected for their personalities and don't feel forced to try to be something they aren't. And sometimes the girls surprise us \u2014 my introvert will rally and want to do a big activity, or my extrovert will hang back and just want to cuddle up close with us. But knowing we can pull them out of a situation that doesn't serve them well eases the pressure on us as their parents.

It's the moment Polin fans have been waiting for.","date":"2024-06-13T09:17:02Z","content":"Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Bridgerton\" season three, episode five. \"Bridgerton\" season three gets a whole lot sexier in part two. For years, \"Bridgerton\" has been praised for its female-gaze-focused, explicit sex scenes. Season one and the \"Queen Charlotte\" spin-off were filled with raunchy romps that weren't usually seen in Regency-era series. But Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington take this to a whole new level in season three, episode five. A day after his sudden proposal \u2014 and that steamy carriage hookup \u2014 Colin (Luke Newton) takes his childhood friend Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) to see the Bridgerton property that would become their home after their marriage. While alone, Colin tells Penelope he loves her and begins describing all the parts of her body he adores. As the pair look at each other in the mirror, Colin starts touching Penelope up and down her body and then strips her of her clothing. Though there have been many shirtless scenes with male leads, this is the first scene in \"Bridgerton\" history in which a female lead character is fully nude in front of the camera. Colin and Penelope then have an extended lovemaking scene on a chaise-lounge chair while a string cover of Ariana Grande's song \"POV\" plays in the background. The scene is sensual, and Penelope, a virgin, is much more of an active participant in the sex scene compared with the previous lead couples' first times. From the physical foreplay to the end, the scene lasts more than 5 \u00bd minutes, which is the longest sex scene of the show, according to Business Insider's extremely scientific calculations.  For months, Coughlan and Newton have been steadily building anticipation for this sex scene in numerous interviews, sending fans into a frenzy. Coughlan told Entertainment Weekly in April that she and Newton broke \"a piece of furniture\" while filming one of the intimate scenes. She wouldn't say what the furniture was at the time, but the chaise lounge in the episode-five scene fits Coughlan's description when she spoke about it again to CapitalFM in May. \"I would say it's like a piece of furniture that you would more see in the past than the present, but yeah, we did break it during a sexy scene because we were really going for it,\" Coughlan said. After season three, part two was released, Coughlan confirmed that they broke the chaise lounge, sharing a picture of the broken chair on Instagram. A post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan) In May, Coughlan also told Stylist that she specifically asked to be \"very naked on camera\" during an explicit scene to clap back at people who'd commented on her body in the past. \"It just felt like the biggest 'fuck you' to all the conversation surrounding my body; it was amazingly empowering,\" Coughlan said, referring to people who'd body-shamed her on social media. Netflix's marketing team also helped create buzz around season three's sex scene by releasing promotional material showing Colin and Penelope in front of a mirror. Fans of the books that \"Bridgerton\" is based on immediately saw this as a signal that the show was adapting the \"mirror scene.\" All these teases made \"Bridgerton\" fans believe they would see some very spicy scenes this season. Sure enough, season three, part two finally rewards their patience. All episodes of season three of \"Bridgerton\" are now streaming on Netflix.

It's always going to happen this way.\" The CEO of Amazon's grocery chain said being open to other people's ideas is crucial for career growth. But he admitted in the interview that he faced a similar pitfall. \"I sometimes could have been that person in my past, on certain things,\" Buechel said. \"And I learned the hard way that you have to be flexible, especially in today's world. Our customers' demands are changing all the time, things are always changing the business.\" Career experts agree that being open to new ideas and flexibility is important for employees \u2014 and they say this virtue should also be applied to leadership. \"It's equally critical for leadership to be open to new ways of doing things and to support their teams in implementing innovative solutions, and it's not just about employees who don't want change,\" Prerika Agarwal, the founder and CEO of Inspiration Careers, told Business Insider in an email, adding that she often encountered employees frustrated by leaders who were resistant to new ideas. Katherine Kirkinis, a career coach for Wanderlust Careers, told BI that being knowledgeable isn't an inherent flaw, and the underlying issue is failing to be open to other people's ideas because of it. \"You may be incredibly intelligent and well versed in your field, but that doesn't mean you can't learn something new from anyone (even someone who is much younger or in a lower-ranked position),\" she wrote. \"The smartest people know this and are always listening, curious, and trying to learn something new from absolutely everyone they encounter.\" Kirkinis added that flexibility is also a key trait since a CEO or a company would want innovation. \"If you figured out one way to do something and it works, fabulous,\" she wrote. \"Perhaps there is a way to improve on that, or make it more efficient. Curiosity and innovation are key \u2014 if you are working with someone who does their job and never innovates, that can be satisfactory, but you can make yourself irreplaceable to a company or team if you innovate and take initiative.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Is it that the tools early humans used were bad at carving out curves? Is it influenced by our understanding of math, space, and gravity? Whatever the reason, most modern homes are \u2014 but, as with most things, there are always outliers. Case in point: a triangle-shaped former car-repair shop in London that architect Richard Brown and his fianc\u00e9e bought for over \u00a3200,000, or around $250,000. They then converted the 430-square-foot space into a livable home via a $127,000 renovation, creative thinking, and a lot of elbow grease. The triangular home is in the heart of West Hampstead, a northwest London neighborhood where the average house costs roughly \u00a31 million, or around $1.3 million. Brown, 37, lives with his fianc\u00e9e Katrina, who asked that her last name not be used for privacy reasons, in the aptly named Triangle House. The property was recently shortlisted for the 2024 Don't Move, Improve! architectural competition recognizing London's most innovative home redesigns. Take a look inside, and learn how the car-repair shop went from grittily industrial to a light, plant-filled home for two. Before they bought the property in 2019, Brown told Business Insider that it was set up as a car mechanic, equipped to service two vehicles. At the time, Brown said, Katrina was looking to buy a property after inheriting some money. \"You'd normally go and find a flat quite far out of London and get it without a mortgage,\" Brown said.  However, Katrina, who is a music teacher, thought otherwise when they happened across the 430-square-foot building in West Hampstead. Brown said West Hampstead is a \"valuable area\" in London, but it wasn't the neighborhood that swayed them to buy the property. \"The weird thing is, we weren't that attracted to the area as much as we were to specifically this little project in this little corner,\" Brown said. Brown is an architect who focuses on public, commercial, and private buildings, and Katrina is a musician who also runs a course that teaches music instructors how to better impart skills to their students. Brown loves music and describes himself as an \"amateur musician.\" The couple wanted their home to be \"clean\" and \"empty enough\" for them to focus on their passions and professions, he said. While the house is \"tiny,\" Brown said it's the perfect size for him and Katrina to live and work in. After moving to East London in the early 2010s, Brown became fascinated with industrial spaces, particularly warehouses, that people were using as living and work spaces. \"I got really interested in affordability and interested in the way in which people were converting warehouses for creative uses,\" he said. The experience shaped his architectural style, which he said focuses on using simple, sustainable materials and techniques. Prior to the Triangle House, Brown had firsthand experience living and working in an unconventional space. His last home, for example, was a brick shed that he shared with six other people. It was a pretty \"bare construction,\" Brown added, but he loved it. Because Katrina bought the property with her inheritance money and Brown was the architect behind the renovation, they decided to draw up a formal contract on paper in case things went, as Brown said, \"awry.\" \"It was really her money and everything on the line,\" he added. \"It was definitely a client-architect relationship because the project could have obviously defeated us, and we'd still have to deliver.\" Brown also carried out most of the renovations to keep costs down. In total, he said the project cost less than \u00a3100,000, or around $128,000. \"It was under \u00a3100,000, mainly because, as a laborer, I wasn't paid,\" he joked. Brown and Katrina were willing to move into the car-repair shop in its unrenovated state. \"We actually just thought we could just come in here and put some windows in and pretty much just occupy it,\" he said.  But to get a mortgage on the property as a residential space, he added, they had to make several changes for it to be deemed \"properly habitable.\" \"That was when we realized, 'Wow, we have to do a lot more work than we thought,'\" he recalled. Upgrades included revising the internal layout of the car-repair shop and installing new drainage, windows, and roof. To let more light into the home, Brown designed roof skylights over the bathroom and main living space.  The two doors that rolled up to allow cars to drive into the shop also got makeovers. One became an entrance to the courtyard and the home. The other got transformed into a large bay window facing the street that is also covered in plants. Designing a home with pointy corners \u2014 one of which is at a 40-degree acute angle \u2014 is tough, Brown said. In fact, he added, he and Katrina went through around 10 design concepts before landing on one in which they planned \"something interesting\" for each corner of the house. One corner holds their small courtyard, full of lush green plants; another houses the only bathroom. The third one, which is also the tightest corner of the property, has an upholstered daybed. Brown and Katrina have nicknamed it the \"cozy corner.\" \"We snuggle up in there, the two of us with the laptop watching Netflix all the time,\" he said. \"It's the place to go at the end of the day and just fall asleep.\" Although the couple initially considered designing the house as a studio, Brown said they ultimately decided to create a separate bedroom and bathroom. But he had to get creative to maximize each space. They dug down to lower the floor in the bedroom, which was \"easy enough to do,\" he added. \"And we were like, 'How do we use that extra space? How do we create storage?'\" The answer, he said, was a slide-away bed. Unlike a Murphy bed, which usually flips into a cabinet, Brown designed the bed to slide underneath an empty cubbyhole beneath the floor of the adjacent room \u2014 the bathroom \u2014 whenever it isn't being used. A motorized system \u2014 to simply push a button and send the bed away into the wall \u2014 would have been great but costly, Brown added. So instead, he attached wheels to the frame. The couple just has to give it a quick push when they want more floor space in the bedroom. \"It's never going to go wrong,\" he said. Brown said his and Katrina's home exemplifies the ethos of most of his architectural projects, which blur the boundaries between living and working spaces. Their triangular abode has homey and cozy features, but when needed, it can also be quite a \"formal space,\" he added. \"When you take away the dining table, fold everything away, and clean it up,\" he said, it transforms into a triangular space that feels \"industrial.\" And even though it's small, Brown said there's plenty of room for the couple to host guests. \"Two weeks ago, we had seven people over rehearsing for a musical performance for someone's wedding \u2014 seven people with instruments in a space that's only 40 square meters,\" he said. \"It worked quite well.\" Get your weekly dose of essential news delivered right to you, plus explore a world of insights with our diverse newsletter subscription options.

Fragrances are one of the biggest affordable-luxury trends that have boomed in recent years, so Business Insider asked two professional perfumers what scents everyone should wear this summer. Here's what the experts said. According to Caitlin Hayes, founder of Sorcellerie Apothecary, tomato-leaf scents are reminiscent of summer weather and savory garden aromas. \"After a morning spent in the garden, the distinctive sweet and spicy scent of tomato leaves and vine lingers on your hands,\" she told BI. \"So this is a perfect reminder of that.\" Hayes recommended Garden Heaux by the Seattle-based company Samar. Although floral scents never seem to be out of style, perfumes that offer a specific mix of peony and bergamot are the way to go this summer, according to Ashley Santiago, junior perfumer at Givaudan. \"It doesn't get more 'hot girl summer' than this scent, and it's a huge compliment getter as my go-to night-out fragrance when it's warm,\" she told BI. She said Carolina Herrera's Good Girl Blush is a great option for this scent profile. It's mango season, and that goes for both the fruit and the wearable scent. \"This fresh, tropical summer fruit is having a moment \u2014 the more realistic, the better,\" Hayes said. Santiago recommended Phlur's Mango Mood Body Mist for a realistic and fresh scent. Tuberose has been around for hundreds of years, and according to Hayes, the floral scent is finally falling back into the spotlight. \"Prized for centuries for its sensual scent, it can have a cooling effect,\" she told BI. \"Think gauzy, sweet white petals, still blooming or tempered with soft spice.\" The perfumer recommended trying Tuberose Tantra by Kismet Olfactive. According to Hayes, incorporating tea-scented perfumes into your summer rotation is a great and lightweight option. \"Green tea, black tea, matcha, oolong, Earl Grey \u2014 however you enjoy your cuppa, there's a perfume for that,\" she told BI Some of her favorite options include Nest Fragrances' Indigo and Sweetly Known by Kerosene. It's time to put away warmer vanilla scents and opt for light, citrusy alternatives. \"Caramel and vanilla are usually welcome, but heavy gourmands can start to feel oppressive in the heat \u2014 a zingy citrus scent has a way of balancing the sugar,\" Hayes told BI. The perfumer said Love and Crime by Ex Idolo is a good option for a sweet, citrus smell. If you want to smell toasty and beachy, Santiago recommended finding a body spray with notes of salted caramel and pistachio. \"I first discovered this salted-caramel-pistachio scent through hair oil and was so happy to see they offered it in a mist format,\" she told BI. Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Crush Cheirosa 62 fragrance mist is the perfumer's top lightweight pick. Leather scents are typically reserved for colder months, but if you find ones balanced with citrus, it could be perfect for summer. \"A leather note combined with some bright citruses like bergamot is an unexpected and unisex combination,\" Santiago said. She recommended Memo Paris' Sicilian Leather perfume. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

Ozeki blamed much of his reluctance on contactless digital registers \u2014 which became popular during the pandemic \u2014 programmed to \"demand\" extra fees. \"I went to a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, and they wanted an additional 20% at the register,\" he said. \"I thought, 'Wow! I'm tipping for the privilege of serving myself!'\" The public relations specialist claimed some businesses used new technology and the so-called \"streamlining\" of payments as an excuse to overcharge consumers. \"They think people will be more forgiving of sticker shock if they assume the increase is going to the person providing the service,\" he said. \"But there's no guarantee that the employees get it,\" he added. \"Companies are cutting corners and getting craftier.\" Ozeki, who immigrated to the US from Japan with his family around age 4, said tipping is offensive to people in his native country, which he visits yearly. \"There is such a high emphasis on delivering the utmost, interactive service when staff are dealing with customers,\" the San Franciscan said. \"They don't believe in people giving them extra money for doing what is expected of them.\" He said it would be considered rude to hand a tip to a hospitality worker, such as a hotel concierge, in exchange for directions or a restaurant recommendation. \"They would probably refuse to take it,\" Ozeki said. Still, back in the US, he recognized the argument that low-paid workers in the service industry have traditionally relied on tips to earn a living wage. But he said that recent increases in the minimum wage have changed the landscape \u2014 at least in certain states. In California, for example, the minimum wage for fast-food workers rose by law this year from $16 to $20 an hour. The deal was struck as a compromise to initial demands of $22 an hour with annual raises. \"The current minimum wage at a fast food place is higher than my starting salary 15 years ago,\" Ozeki said. He said he never ordered food for delivery because of the expected tip. \"I pick it up myself,\" he said. \"There's no need for me to tip the cashier for processing my payment or the person moving something a couple of feet across the counter for me to retrieve.\" For sit-down meals, he often rounds up the bill to the nearest dollar if the service is \"minimal\" and he doesn't expect to return. If the restaurant is more upscale and, he suggested, the waitstaff \"attentively brings drinks and dishes to the table for 30 minutes or more,\" he would honor the included service charge. \"An automatic gratuity indicates that the business is treating its staff well,\" he told BI. As for transport, he doesn't use ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft \u2014 principally because of the expected gratuity. \"I call a regular cab from my home and pay by cash, not a card,\" Ozeki said. \"The drivers are grateful because they don't lose out by digitally processing the charge and paying the middleman.\" He also pays the woman who cuts his hair in cash \u2014 with no tip. \"I go to a neighborhood place where she works out of her garage,\" he said. \"I pay the agreed amount and leave.\" Thick-skinned, he said it wouldn't bother him if people thought his lack of tipping was stingy. \"I've given it a lot of thought and stand by my reasons 100%.\"Are you tired of tipping culture in the US or abroad?

Sacrificing comfort and onboard freebies to save a buck was worth it then, and the ULCCs were banking on travelers like me to stay loyal to the business model. However, flexibility and convenience have become more important to me in recent years, and this is where the ULCCs have slipped while mainline carriers have improved. Plus, I'm not convinced that Frontier and Spirit's recent addition of \"premium\" perks will give either a competitive edge. I know when I book a ULCC that I am committing to at least a few hours of sitting in a cramped, bare-bones plane, where even a cup of water costs money. Most seats don't recline, have headrests, or have televisions. Only Spirit offers WiFi \u2014 and for a fee. These cabins can be bearable on shorter flights when the fare is a really good deal. But why settle when mainlines combine the best of both worlds? American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines recognized the budget competition years ago and created their own version of a cheap ticket: basic economy. The goal was to lure in price-conscious travelers like me with discounted but still amenity-heavy tickets. These stripped-down fares have limitations. United doesn't allow a carry-on bag while American and Delta do, for example. Still, all three come with the regular mainline cabin perks, like reclining seats, in-flight entertainment, headrests, free snacks and drinks, and standard legroom. Further, domestic WiFi is free on all three for eligible T-Mobile customers like me, while Delta and American have their respective free internet packages \u2014 even for basic economy ticketholders. In my experience, mainline tickets are sometimes cheaper than Frontier or Spirit. For example, the base fare for a roundtrip evening flight from LaGuardia Airport to Orlando in mid-August costs $211 on Spirit and $277 on Delta. Once you factor in the $50 fee for a carry-on bag on Spirit \u2014 which applies in both directions \u2014 the total price is $311. Reserving a specific seat would be another $30 at least, with the cheapest seats being $15 per leg. Delta's basic economy already includes a carry-on and a standard seat with WiFi, power, and entertainment. However, it doesn't offer seat selection, even if you want to pay extra. And, unlike Spirit's new policy, Delta charges change and cancel fees for its cheapest tickets. Despite the pros and cons, it's still an easy choice. With everything equal in terms of route, timing, and carry-ons, Delta is $34 cheaper. United CEO Scott Kirby said it perfectly in a podcast interview last week: \"They don't treat their customers right.\" He specifically pointed to an unnamed ULCC that charged people $99 for carry-ons and then paid a commission to the agent who charged the fee.  I've never been charged for a personal item or carry-on on Frontier or Spirit because I follow the rules to a T. However, the fiasco proves that it may not matter if you follow the rules \u2014 there's an incentive to charge people anyway. This adds a level of stress I don't have when flying the mainline. To their credit, the ULCCs have ditched some of their low-cost strategies with more premium options. Spirit has dropped all change and cancel fees, and Frontier is adding business-class-like seats to lure in more premium travelers.  But it's too little too late, in my opinion. The two still lag in terms of customer service, both ranking last in terms of customer complaints and the economy product for 2023.  One of the best examples is that Frontier's only line of communication between the customer and the airline is an online chat, not a phone number, unless you have status or are or have traveled within 24 hours. It's a way to save on costs but at the customer's expense \u2014 which is exactly Kirby's point.  Frontier and Spirit ranked last for flight delays and cancellations last year, according to Cirium, and they collected the highest number of customer complaints. Sure, you could get delayed and canceled on any airline anytime \u2014 but the data doesn't lie. I have a better shot of getting to my destination on time by booking a mainline. ULCC networks are also less robust than mainlines. The flights are commonly early in the morning or late at night, and there are fewer frequencies per day. This inconvenience makes flying ULCCs more risky overall. For instance, if I miss a connection or my flight is canceled, the mainlines have a bigger network with more re-booking options. In my LaGuardia to Orlando example, Spirit's morning flights leave before 10 a.m., and the evening flights leave after 9 p.m. Delta has options all day. I like that peace of mind.

The finale, released on Thursday, features the first appearance of John Stirling's (Victor Alli) cousin, Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza). The cameo from John's relative is significant because it's one of the many ways the show diverges from Quinn's book series, by setting up a queer romance for Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd). Here's what you need to know about Baduza, the newest \"Bridgerton\" cast member. The South African actor graduated with an associate of fine arts (AFA) degree in 2016. Other notable NYFA alums include Issa Rae and Aubrey Plaza. Since graduating, Baduza has acted in theater productions, TV shows, and movies. Baduza made her film debut in the 2019 movie \"Bhai's Cafe.\" After a few roles in shorts and TV shows, including BBC's drama series \"Noughts + Crosses,\" the actor landed a part in the 2022 film \"The Woman King\" starring Viola Davis.  Baduza played Fumbe, a member of the movie's all-female army. In the \"Bridgerton\" books, John dies two years into his marriage to Francesca and his cousin Michael becomes the new Earl of Kilmartin. Years pass before Francesca and Michael reconnect and explore their feelings for each other, leading to marriage and two children. Since Michael has been gender-flipped for the TV show adaptation, Francesca's love story will probably play out much differently. In an interview with Glamour, \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell said that they \"flew her out the moment we saw her tape to do a chemistry read with Hannah.\" \"She absolutely nailed it,\" Brownell said, adding that Dodd was keen on Baduza being cast after meeting her. \"I remember the moment Hannah met Masali,\" Brownell recalled. \"After Masali left, she said, 'Well, that's her.' Hannah could feel it. She is an incredible actress, and she and I have had a lot of talks about the weight and importance of her role. She's really stepped into it with wonderful energy.\" All eight episodes of \"Bridgerton\" season three are now streaming on Netflix. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Here's how they tasted.","date":"2024-06-13T18:11:57Z","content":"From versatile crispy jalape\u00f1o pieces to luscious Southern-style peach ice cream, Trader Joe's has plenty of seasonal items for the summer.  As part of an ongoing series in which I review Trader Joe's seasonal products, I gave the chain's summer offerings a try. Products vary each year from summer to summer, but many return.  Keep reading to find out which products I'll return for and which ones I'll pass on next time.   I know that arugula gets a bad rap because of its strong, slightly bitter flavor, but give this salad a chance. This salad's astringent of greens packed every bite with a bold, peppery flavor that played well with the delicious melange of nutty roasted almonds, sweet carrot ribbons, and salty Parmesan flakes. There wasn't a ton of each topping, but enough for me to notice the textural contributions. All of this was tied together with a lemon-basil vinaigrette that tasted more like a mustard dressing than any of the two named ingredients, yet somehow still worked perfectly with everything else.  That said, the salad certainly could have used more dressing. So this is me, once again, asking Trader Joe's to please give us two packets of vinaigrette with every bagged salad. Nevertheless, this salad tasted like something I'd pay $14 for at a swanky brunch restaurant. Plus, it comes as an all-in-one meal kit, with no additional shopping, chopping, or slicing required. Goodbye, boring mixed-green salads \u2014 I've met my match. VERDICT: If I had a cooler, this is exactly the kind of salad I'd throw in it and take to an outdoor lunch. Given how much it would cost to buy this salad's individual ingredients \u2014 like the almonds alone \u2014 it's worth buying.   Upon opening the box, I was met with the fresh, invigorating scent of key limes \u2014 a nice preview for the bright, aromatic, and all-around delightful snacking experience to come. The cookies themselves were roughly the size of a silver dollar and just a bit thicker than a standard wafer treat, lending them a delicate quality that would make them perfect for an outdoor picnic or afternoon tea, as the name aptly suggests. Trader Joe's absolutely nailed the shortbread texture. Key-lime pie is often paired with a honeyed graham-cracker crust, but the simple, buttery shortbread made the citrus flavor pop and lent the cookies a soft yet crumbly mouthfeel. Every bite was bursting with refreshing key-lime flavor that tasted exactly like the center of the famous pie, and the dusting of powdered sugar enhanced the citrus' subtle sweetness. VERDICT: These key-lime tea cookies were such a nice change of pace from the usual chocolate or strawberry-themed sweets I enjoy during the summer. Between their delicate texture and yummy key-lime flavor, these cookies will be a staple of mine for years to come \u2014 no tea party necessary.  This dill-pickle mustard packed quite a punch. The herbaceous dill was in full effect, almost to an unrelenting degree, and dominated every corner of my nose and taste buds, with a kick of tangy vinegar in tow. Although dill was the dominant flavor, it didn't completely bury the sharp, savory mustard that was the perfect pairing for this herb and made the whole mix even spicier. This mustard is flavored with dill weed and contains chunks of pickle. I liked the added texture. It tasted great on my barbecue sandwich, and I can totally see it elevating a hamburger or hot dog, especially if you're a pickle fan. By itself, it's a bit too sharp and strong, but then again, most people aren't just eating mustard by the spoonful.  VERDICT: This mustard was pretty good, but I can't see myself buying it more than once every year or two. Still, the fun combination of vinegary pickles, aromatic dill, and sharp mustard makes this a great condiment for any summer barbecue.  I'm not sure it gets any better than tender chicken doused in a slightly smoky yet sweet sauce. Each package of this item comes with a pound of ready-to-eat chicken in chunks that are just the right size to add to any dish, which I appreciated as a working single person who doesn't always have time to meal prep. Everything comes precooked, but you can microwave the meat for two minutes if you prefer it warm. The tender and flavorful results made this option that much better than Trader Joe's year-round offerings, so much so that I don't even know why I'm bothering to cook this summer. Even better, there was ample sauce to go around, and this stuff tasted like liquid gold and clung nicely to each chunk of meat. It wasn't too sweet and boasted a refined, woody, peppery profile with subtle notes of molasses.  This product is the absolutely perfect execution of a convenient meal. Bravo, Trader Joe's. VERDICT: As someone who loves barbecue but doesn't own a grill or smoker, I'm certain this pulled chicken will be a staple in my house. It's easy to throw together and also super versatile \u2014 the tender chunks of meat would make the perfect addition to sandwiches, pizzas, and salads.  Amazingly, this dip had the same creamy texture as the chain's other hummus options, so you'd never guess there's real pickle and might even mistake the green bits of dill for other herbs like basil. That said, you can absolutely taste it, but the vinegary tang was light enough to be enjoyable. The tahini, chickpea, and garlic flavors paired well with the dill, which makes sense since the herb is a common ingredient in tzatziki, which is usually eaten alongside hummus.  This dip also managed to avoid being overly salty. It also paired almost too well with savory chips.  At the same time, the brine-y pickle flavor lent the dip a slightly sour overtone, which I surprisingly enjoyed. I'm salivating just thinking about how this spread would taste smeared inside a turkey sandwich. VERDICT: This dill-pickle hummus has convinced me to embrace the mantra \"don't knock it 'til you try it,\" and the snack section of my fridge will be eternally grateful.  I know there's no vodka in this Bloody Mary salsa, but this tasty, peppery dip transported me to a boozy brunch. Spice-forward, tangy, and bursting with the sharp bite of horseradish, black pepper, and bitter celery salt, this product encompasses all of the flavors of its namesake cocktail.  The only thing that separated this from an actual Bloody Mary mix was the texture, but it was so good that I could probably blend it to drink on its own. It was undoubtedly a chunky salsa, with tomato bits of varying sizes swimming in a sea of peppers and flavorful juices. It tasted so much more complex than many of the chain's other jarred salsas, and I'm shocked that most restaurants don't already serve a version of this on their menu. I genuinely wouldn't change a thing about it. VERDICT: It looks like this item is seasonal but doesn't return every year. It was so good I hope it keeps coming back.  I don't have gluten sensitivities, but I appreciate that Trader Joe's makes snacks that myself and my gluten-free friends can enjoy. These crisps looked pretty underwhelming. With a slightly murky tan hue and the thickness of a wafer, they seemed like flat cookies \u2014 make sure to clearly mark these when you put them out unless you want some confused party guests. Biting into these cauliflower crisps turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Like most gluten-free products, they were thicker than the standard chip due to the base of brown rice and cauliflower, but their texture was both crunchy and scrumptious. They were sturdy enough to hold up to hummus and the Bloody Mary salsa without breaking or disintegrating, which is better than some of the regular chips I buy. They also sported a neutral onion-garlic seasoning that would make them palatable with a bunch of different dips, yet tasty enough to eat on their own. I definitely picked up on a cauliflower aftertaste, but it was so light that I grew accustomed to it after the second bite. Plus, the crisps were so well-salted that I didn't mind. VERDICT: Even though I wish these came in a slightly bigger bag, these were tasty, gluten-free chips just about everyone can enjoy. If you dislike coconut milk, don't be put off by the label that lists it as a key ingredient \u2014 I couldn't detect the slightest hint of it.  I assumed these sticks were going to taste like a Jolly Rancher, but Trader Joe's instead opted for a jelly filling. When I first sampled these, I audibly uttered, \"Oh, that's different!\" As I ate more, I grew accustomed to the sensation of biting into the chocolate and tasting that sweet, fruity center. The filling didn't taste like fresh watermelon, but I've come to learn this type of flavoring rarely does. In this case, it was more like a cross between whatever goes in the chain's chocolate-covered Powerberries and toaster pastries, with added watermelon juice. When paired with the dark-chocolate exterior, these flavors made for an OK combination, but I think it would've been more satisfying with citrus or sweetly tart fruits like oranges and strawberries.  The sticks are cute, but they're not as striking as they'd be if Trader Joe's made them half-moon-shaped mini watermelons.  I also find that salty or spicy flavors pair better with the sunny sweetness of melons. VERDICT: I didn't love these chocolaty watermelon pieces enough to buy them again, but they'd make a great addition to a snack table.   As long as I live, I will loudly proclaim and defend my love for all things pineapple, and I'll continue by raving about how great this barbecue sauce is. Tomato, molasses, pineapple, and other notable flavors come together to form a sauce that's equal parts tangy, peppery, and sweet. I'd actually call it restaurant quality. It tasted quite similar to Trader Joe's standard barbecue sauce with a sweet touch from the pineapple. The main difference is the texture since some bits of crushed fruit were in the jar. But this sauce was such a standout because it absorbed all of the natural-sugar flavors and the subtle kick of citrus without tasting fruity. It's the kind of addition that would make grilled dishes come alive. If I owned a grill, I'd cover everything with it, but for now, my frozen fries and nuggets will have to suffice. VERDICT: This item is absolutely worth buying for the summer. Even though I can't see myself wanting to use it all of the time, it's a fresh take on standard barbecue sauce.  After finally getting my hands on a can of these crispy jalape\u00f1os, I can totally see them becoming a contender for the chain's next Customer Choice Awards. Falling somewhere between a ridged potato chip and nacho topping with a scent that's nearly identical to jalape\u00f1o-cheese bagels, these crispy bits have the \"it\" factor that would make them both the perfect snack and sandwich addition. They're crunchy, salty, savory, and spicy, but not in an overwhelming way. I'd been eating them by the handful and found the burn pleasantly crept onto the roof of my mouth but quickly dissipated. They reminded me of a cooler version of the onion strings you'd put on green-bean casserole with an added kick, so I'm hoping this product becomes a year-round staple. Best of all, these pieces seemed to go with everything. I sprinkled a few on top of a barbecue-chicken sandwich and was blown away by how well they enhanced the savory flavors. They'd likely taste great crumbled on tacos, nachos, or inside a burger, but they're also just as yummy straight out of the can. VERDICT: If you're a fan of crispy onion strings and aren't afraid of a little heat, you'll love these crispy jalape\u00f1o pieces. Between their crispy potato-chip texture and a piquant jalape\u00f1o flavor, these will make an appearance in many of my meals and snack bowls this summer.   I don't write expletives in my reviews, but I'll admit that I uttered one \u2014 in the best way possible \u2014 when I first sampled this peach-crisp ice cream. It was one of the best store-bought ice creams I've ever tried. Every bite was full of decadent, milky sweet-cream flavor. The peach presence was subtle enough that it was like receiving a pleasant surprise on top of the dessert I was already enjoying. The same goes for the oat chunks \u2014 I definitely had to hunt for them, but when I did find them, it was like hitting the lottery since they tasted like mini, soft-baked oatmeal cookies with cinnamon and brown-sugar undertones. Plus, this ice cream was so smooth that it tasted as if an individual person churned it themselves. If you told me I could only eat one ice cream for the rest of the year and gave me this option, I'd be peachy keen. VERDICT: I've enjoyed a lot of good sweets in my day, but I don't remember the last time my taste buds were this happy.  When I was a kid, I always asked for ice cream in a cup for more bang for my buck and less mess, but the older I get, the more I appreciate what the right cone can bring to the table. This sugar cone was the perfect vehicle for enjoying my Trader Joe's ice cream. It was sturdy enough to keep everything intact without losing its crunch and was a lightly sweet complement to the frozen treat.  It was also just the right size \u2014 I comfortably fit a decent scoop onto the cone without any ice cream spilling out of the sides. VERDICT: If you're going to Trader Joe's to buy ice cream, you might as well pick up some cones. I'd keep these on hand to enjoy with cool treats and avoid sticky dishes all summer long.  As the \"pickle friend\" in my group, even I'll admit that sometimes we need to just let pickles be pickles. Every food under the sun doesn't need to be infused with dill, and these chips are proof of that.  Even though they had all of the right elements \u2014 the perfect crunch, plenty of seasoning, and ample salt \u2014 something about eating them felt wrong. They tasted exactly like a dill pickle but also left a lingering aftertaste in my mouth that I wasn't particularly thrilled about. This isn't as noticeable when I eat regular pickles since they're usually dredged in a liquid brine, but coming from a dry potato chip made it unpleasant. I don't understand why these were made \u2014 if I wanted a crunchy snack that tasted like a pickle, I'd just eat one. And if I wanted a bite-sized variety, I could easily get those too. You could argue that chips are more suitable for dipping, but the dill flavor was so strong that the only thing I'd pair these with is the pickle hummus \u2014 which admittedly did make both components taste really good. That said, I'm certainly not going to sink these into my caramelized-onion dip anytime soon. VERDICT: Sorry to my fellow pickle fans, but I thought these chips were a disappointment.   With the flavors of fresh corn and lightly sweet burrata all wrapped up in pillowy pockets, this ravioli captures the essence of the perfect summer pasta. The corn added a pleasant pop of fresh flavor, and the burrata boasted a creamy, mildly buttery taste. This was the most visibly plump Trader Joe's ravioli I've ever sampled, which is probably due to each pasta's pocket-like shape. Plus, every piece held up through the cooking process.  I couldn't really taste the basil that was advertised on the bag, but I was willing to overlook that since the ravioli was fine without it and I topped my dish with fresh pieces of the herb anyway. VERDICT: Thanks to the irresistibly tasty burrata and sweet-corn filling, this option might just dethrone Trader Joe's lemon variety as my favorite ravioli. It's perfect for weeknight dinners when you want something filling yet light. It will forever receive recognition as a summer staple in my home.  I normally loathe store-bought potato salad, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The potato pieces were cooked just right and held up well under the dressing. It had a bit of a drier mouthfeel (which is sort of expected for something sitting on the shelf), but for the most part, I'd describe the overall texture of this stuff as quite creamy, but not at all mushy.  The big sell for me was that it wasn't overly mayonnaise-y, a common pitfall of most store-bought potato salads. Instead, Trader Joe's did a nice job salting this just enough to be enticing. The addition of green scallions and finely chopped hard-boiled eggs also offered more flavor beyond just salt. The dish had a slight vinegar taste, and this salad would've been near-perfect for me had it included actual bits of pickle or relish. Even without it, this potato salad still made for an adequate starchy side dish. VERDICT: No matter what, homemade will always be the best when it comes to potato salad. Still, I really enjoyed this and will definitely be buying it again next time I'm in the mood for barbecue.  Like the other Jangles from Trader Joe's, this bag features a hodgepodge of various crunchy and chewy textured mini treats. Unlike the other Jangles, however, this one seemed like it was engineered by a child who was given free rein to throw whatever goodies they liked into a massive jar and call it a day. To be fair, that's my bad for not taking the cue from the unicorn on the bag. It contains strawberry-flavored mini marshmallows, pink confection chips, chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets, and \u2014 interestingly \u2014 lemon-yogurt-dipped animal cookies. It is as ridiculously sweet as you can imagine, but if you know what you're getting into, it shouldn't be shocking.  There are also regular pretzel lattices in the mix, which seem like some last attempt to add some salt (maybe an adult stepped into the room during the creation process), but the mix is still too sweet for me. In this case, the pretzels are kind of like the people who showed up late to the party without the invite. VERDICT: Although I don't see myself buying this Jangle again, I can see it being a hit for kids. I'd also recommend this to anyone with a serious sweet tooth looking for something colorful and fun to put on display.  Each pretzel is covered on all sides in a pretty pink-and-white yogurt coating that tasted like it had real strawberry infused into it. It was delicately sweet with a twinge of fruitiness that was well balanced by the salt of the pretzel. This treat reminded me of dipping french fries into a strawberry milkshake.  I was especially big on the fact that they were miniature. It added to the cuteness factor and made it so I could enjoy a few of them at a time, and there was still plenty in the bag to go around for days. VERDICT: In my opinion, these are a welcome addition to the lineup of seasonal dipped pretzels but they're not as tasty as the ginger ones Trader Joe's has had in the spring.  These lumpy mounds attempt to harness the totality of the camping snack into bite-sized candy-bar form, without the mess. A bag contains around 12 silver-dollar-sized pieces, each consisting of a layer of graham cracker topped with a mini marshmallow, enrobed in deliciously smooth milk chocolate.   The milk-chocolate layer was thick, smooth, and sweet. In my humble opinion, the chocolate seemed better quality than typical candy bars and more like what you might find at a theme-park candy shop. The graham cracker was just the right thickness to make its appearance known with a slight crunch and tasty honey flavor.  One note for the dessert purists \u2014 because the marshmallows are small, they get buried a bit, so if you're looking for a true s'more flavor experience, this isn't quite that. VERDICT: Treats like these are the reason I'm a Trader Joe's loyalist for life. I'll be mourning when they disappear come fall. I'd also love to see a dark-chocolate version someday.   Picture vanilla pudding in cake form, and you have Trader Joe's take on tres leches. Like most versions of this dessert, the texture was so spongy and so soft under the milks that it pretty much dissolved immediately when it touched my tongue. Each bite brought an omnipresent vanilla sweetness that I couldn't help but keep going back to, even though it tasted a bit artificial. It sort of felt like eating vanilla custard with cake pieces in it.  Overall, for a frozen cake, it's really quite yummy. The convenience really won me over. I love baking tres leches, but it can be a lot of work. With this, I simply let this thaw in my fridge for several hours and it was ready to eat. The frosting, however, was a letdown. It tasted like an unsweetened, whipped buttercream without any flavoring, in my opinion. Thankfully, it's nothing a bit of fruit cannot improve. I didn't have any fruit on hand when I tried this, but if I did, this would have been a home run. VERDICT: As someone who enjoys baking tres leches but doesn't always want to go to the trouble of making an entire cake (let alone buying three milks), I really appreciate this cake. For all its flaws, it really is quite superb for a frozen cake. I'll definitely be picking up one more box for the summer.  I was so excited to try this that I actually skipped reading the instructions that state to warm it in the oven before taking a bite. It was still tasty.  Once fully heated, this bread reminded me of a better version of the cheesy bread I add to every pizza-delivery order. It was super soft with a slightly doughy, almost bagel-like chew without being too dense. It tasted plenty cheesy and mildly spicy thanks to the jalape\u00f1o rings baked directly into it.   Basically, this bread is the stuff of dreams. I dipped it into cream cheese to balance out the heat, but I'd serve it with something like the chain's elote dip if I wanted to kick up the heat. Really, my only complaint is that the package isn't resealable. VERDICT: I would absolutely buy this again.  Trader Joe's corn ribs are like regular corn on the cob that's been cut into smaller sections for easier eating, so there is still a cob in the center. These curved corn sticks created a pool of what seemed to be vegan butter on my baking sheet by the time they finished heating in the oven. Still, this didn't translate to a greasy taste. In fact, these were actually quite tasty.  The reddish-brown seasoning offered a salty taste with a very faint hint of cumin-like flavor, but overall, it wasn't very strong. I squeezed some lime over my corn ribs to brighten things up a bit. These would also benefit significantly from being slathered in another sauce, like elote dip. The slightly curved shape and the fact that the kernels sit on a \"bone\" really did make each bite of this feel like I was eating the vegetarian version of a rib, which was pretty neat. I wish these existed years ago when I was still not eating meat. In all, this is a satisfying vegan barbecue food, but I'm not sure if it's for me. I say this as someone with the privilege of living in an apartment complex with a communal grill space. For someone living somewhere where this kind of food isn't accessible, I can see these being a game changer. VERDICT: I don't think I'd buy these again for myself \u2014 I prefer regular corn on the cob, and the portion size in the bag seemed a bit small \u2014 but I still think these ribs are neat to try.   Despite the gummy name, these weren't like bendable gelatinous worms or bears in the movie concession stand. I think they're more like actual fruit snacks, pleasantly chewy and easy to bite into.   Each morsel had a fruit-juice-style sweetness that was slightly tart on the finish. To me, the prevailing flavor was peach, with a few gummies offering a vague lime flavor. Either way, they're quite yummy, and the shapes are absolutely adorable. VERDICT: These are an essential for road trips.   I expected this salad to resemble a classic Greek salad, but it tasted more like a fancy slaw. In place of typical leafy greens were sturdy leaves of finely chopped romaine and radicchio. The salad also contains shredded broccoli and toasted flatbread sticks, which made it a win for crunch factor, and a tasty classic red-wine vinaigrette that's neither too tangy nor sweet.  For the most part, I thought this was fine, but nothing to write home about. Some of the dried tomato bits were too dry, in my opinion, resulting in some awkwardly brittle pieces. The feta crumbles practically vanished once everything was tossed together, and there were so few chickpeas they almost seemed like they weren't supposed to be there. As my experience is with most Trader Joe's salad kits, I think it also could've used a lot more dressing. Like, at least two packets. On the plus side, this held up well for hours and didn't get soggy \u2014 probably because there was so little dressing. Overall, It's not bad if you're looking for something green to sneak as a side into your weeknight meals. VERDICT: I probably won't go out of my way to get this for lunch, but I might pick it up if I needed a last-minute side for pasta. When I opened the container of Trader Joe's peaches-and-cream spread, I saw no obvious peach chunks. When I tried it, the fruity component was very noticeable, and there was a slight tang the moment the spread hit my palate.  I thought this tasted like a denser, slightly sweeter, spreadable peach yogurt. It's decently tasty, but if you're not a huge fan of peaches, this might be too much without another strong flavor to pair it with. I spread it on regular wheat bread, but I imagine it would be great on French toast with lots of cinnamon and fresh peaches. VERDICT: Though I probably wouldn't buy this again, I'd recommend it to anyone who loves peaches.  The level of pucker in these patriotic-colored ice pops sent me into another dimension. OK, maybe that's dramatic. But I thought these were much more tart than sweet. The red layer of the ice pop was strawberry-flavored, but to me, it seemed closer to raspberry or cherry. The center layer was a similar-tasting icy blueberry puree, and the bottom white layer was an intensely sour cold lemon-juice concentrate.  Though I prefer an ice pop with a touch of creamy sweetness, these were still pretty decent. I also loved that the color of each icy layer was at the center of the flavor above it. For example, the red strawberry layer had a blueberry core. Best of all, each pop is just the right size for a light snack. I think the picture on the box is pretty much to scale.  VERDICT: I can't see myself buying another box, but I'd recommend these to anyone wanting a light, frozen treat.  This item was delicious. The granola had just the right level of passion-fruit-like sweetness to give me that tropical, fruity vibe without tasting like perfume or fruity lotion (which, for me, is a common problem with passion-fruit-flavored products). This flavor worked surprisingly well when paired with the oat clusters. The sour notes tasted sweet against the nuttiness.  The granola mixture also contained freeze-dried raspberries, which offered a soft bite that dissolved into a bright, tart flavor.  I intended to sample just a few tiny pieces but ended up pouring some into a ramekin for snacking. VERDICT: I'm planning to grab another bag before the summer ends. It's tasty enough to eat as a snack, but I'm positive it would be amazing on top of an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl or plain yogurt.  Some people will undoubtedly find these crackers odd. Honestly, I understand \u2014 this snack is essentially a spicy cookie masquerading as a cracker. But I loved it.  The lively jalape\u00f1o worked wonderfully with the dry, sweet strawberry bits, with a quick-hitting medium heat that warmed the sides of my mouth and built with each successive bite. It was like the feeling of a hot summer day outdoors captured inside a single cracker. I enjoyed these plain, but I'd also have them with plain goat cheese or Brie to bring out even more sweet notes. VERDICT: This is the only cracker I'll be buying this summer. Click to keep reading other Trader Joe's taste tests in this series.

Dressed in a dark-colored suit and tie, the 18-year-old son of the high-profile Republican congresswoman appeared in the Garfield County Courthouse Thursday with his newly hired attorney, William Trent Palmer. Tyler Boebert had been without an attorney during his last two court appearances, first telling the judge that he was having trouble affording a lawyer. The teen informed Ninth Judicial District Judge John Neiley during an April 11 appearance, \"We are working to hire an attorney, but it's just been kind of hard with the prices, but we are working on it.\" At an appearance on May 9, he told Neiley that he only sent in the paperwork to sign up for a public defender days earlier, drawing disappointment from the judge. \"I wish you'd turned in that application a little sooner,\" Neiley told Tyler Boebert at the time. But Tyler Boebert did not go with a public defender, after all. Palmer runs his own private practice based in Carbondale, Colorado. On Thursday, Palmer asked the judge to continue Boebert's case until July 25. The judge checked with Boebert if that date worked for him and the teenager confirmed it did. \"We're going to continue the case then so that you and Mr. Palmer can have some discussions and then continued discussions with the DA as well,\" Neiley said. Palmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday. The courthouse clerk told BI that Palmer officially entered his appearance into Tyler Boebert's case on May 26. Public records show Palmer works at the law firm WTP LAW. \"Through experience, WTP | LAW has developed adept strategies to defend even the most serious allegations, including drugs and weapons charges, burglary and theft, domestic violence related offenses, and others,\" the firm's website says. Boebert was arrested by the Rifle Police Department in February in connection to a string of car break-ins and property thefts in Rifle, Colorado. He faces more than a dozen charges, including several felony charges for criminal possession of ID documents. According to an arrest affidavit, the teen is one of four people accused of breaking into four cars in the city of Rifle, Colorado, and stealing wallets to make purchases at businesses including McDonald's, Starbucks, and gas stations. At the time of his arrest, Lauren Boebert said in a statement to BI that her son should be \"held accountable for poor decisions just like any other citizen.\" The congresswoman has not shown up for her son's court appearances, but she did support former President Donald Trump at his recent criminal hush-money trial in New York City.

The AI boom and soaring demand for Nvidia GPUs have propelled the company's stock and earned the Nvidia CEO a reputation as a visionary. Even Mark Zuckerberg calls him the \"Taylor Swift of tech.\" People who have worked for Huang on Nvidia's journey to become a $3 trillion-plus company previously described how he can be a \"demanding\" boss. Eight current and former Nvidia employees spoke to Business Insider about Huang's leadership style and what it's like to be grilled by him. These people asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. They describe his approach to leadership as a blend of high expectations, a demand for intellectual honesty, and a \"relentless pursuit of perfection.\" Huang's approach has helped drive Nvidia's success and created a culture with a growth mindset, according to the people who spoke to BI. Two former executives described Huang as the smartest person they've ever met. \"He is a master at crystallizing complex things with simple clarity; he's able to boil stuff down and has very broad, deep knowledge and can go as deep as you want to on pretty much any subject,\" one said. Another insider revealed that Huang often asks questions he already knows the answers to as a way of assessing comprehension of a topic. They said it's a strategic tactic and reminiscent of the character Lieutenant Columbo in the TV drama \"Columbo,\" who would feign ignorance to catch people off guard or get them to slip up. As a leader, Huang is incredibly hands-on and meticulous in his attention to detail, several people said. \"Jensen is deeply involved in everything, and he works tirelessly \u2014 I think work is his hobby,\" a current employee said. Huang often reviews slide decks before presentations and, at times, suggests last-minute changes to ensure they meet his high standards, two people said. He also favors a flat organizational structure, reflected in Nvidia's office layout in the 2000s, where even executives had cubicles. That was a way to avoid creating separation between rank-and-file staff and the leadership, a former senior-level employee said. The company's house style for writing emails is another area where Huang's influence is felt. Employees are expected to send Huang and their department a list of their top five priorities each week. Huang even responds to some of these emails, according to three people, which they felt showed his engagement with every aspect of operations. Huang sets high expectations for his employees as well as himself. \"He's definitely a demanding leader; he's a bit like a sports coach in that he expects a lot of you because he wants you to achieve your potential for your own good and for the good of the team,\" one person said, adding that they saw it as a positive quality.Admitting mistakes is crucial at Nvidia, as it's seen as a way to learn and improve. Huang fosters what the insiders called \"intellectual honesty.\" That means owning up when you screw up, and you could be in trouble if you don't admit your mistakes, they said.A former executive recalled a telling moment in 1999, after Nvidia launched its first GPU, when Huang asked about the launch event. Despite the positive feedback, Huang's only question was \"What could you have done better?\" Three former senior-level employees said Huang's leadership style is based on this focus on continuous improvement and learning from mistakes. Another former executive described this approach as a \"relentless pursuit of perfection.\" He said he believes Huang thinks teaching people and pointing out learning opportunities is part of his job. Senior-level employees often experience what some have referred to as a \"Jensen grilling\"\u2014 intense questioning by Huang. Several people BI spoke to said they had felt the heat in meetings. \"Everybody gets asked tough questions; you're expected to know your business,\" a former executive said. \"If you started to look like you didn't know, he'd start grilling you and finding what you didn't know as a way to tell you 'go get on top of this'.\" One employee likened Huang's grilling to an attorney's interrogation, noting that he wouldn't back down until he'd made his point. \"Some say if you don't get yelled at by Jensen, it's because he doesn't care about you.\" Huang is also known inside the company for his generosity and philanthropy. A former executive said he has opened his home in Hawaii to some staff and even made them breakfast as he likes to cook. During the 2010s, Huang decided to ditch company Christmas parties in favor of employees doing charitable work. \"We started helping schools in disrepair in the Bay Area, hiring people or volunteering ourselves,\" one employee said. In 2011, when Japan was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, Huang quickly donated money and encouraged staff to do the same. Nvidia declined to comment. Do you work a Nvidia? Got insights to share?

Record-breaking temperatures and extreme weather events around the globe in recent days portend another blistering summer as the surge in travel after the height of the pandemic continues to climb. Greek authorities closed the Acropolis in Athens on Wednesday and Thursday during a sweltering midday heat wave. Temperatures soared above 104 degrees Fahrenheit across much of central and southern Greece this week, resulting in all archeological sites in the Greek capital going dormant from midday to 5 p.m. local time, The Associated Press reported. The Acropolis, Greece's most popular tourist site, also closed last summer because of heat. But meteorologists said this week that this was the earliest heat wave recorded in Greek history, and the soaring temperatures have officials on high alert for potential wildfires. Passengers stuck on board a Qatar Airways flight in Athens on Monday resorted to stripping as they sat in 95-degree heat with no air conditioning. In Cyprus \u2014 one of Europe's sunniest destinations \u2014 a wave of heat-related wildfires has broken out near Paphos. The island draws scores of tourists each summer, eager to explore Cyprus' Roman ruins and beautiful beaches. Further north, a holiday village in Turkey's Antalya Province was battered by flames as temperatures surpassed 102 degrees Fahrenheit, Euronews reported. Meanwhile, torrential rains in parts of Spain wiped out crops in Murcia and grounded some flights on the popular tourist island of Mallorca, the outlet reported. And the crisis is only likely to worsen as the summer drags on. Todd Crawford, the vice president of meteorology at Atmospheric G2, told The New York Times last month that the firm expected 2024 temperatures across Europe to be on par with heat levels on the continent in 2022 \u2014 the hottest summer ever recorded on the continent. Crawford said July and August, especially, would be blistering throughout the world's fastest-warming continent. But the perils of the climate crisis haven't stopped people from flocking to places such as Italy, Croatia, and Greece \u2014 all countries that were afflicted by scorching heat last summer. Sweltering summers aren't a problem unique to Europe. The US is set to be smacked with life-threatening temperatures in the coming days, too. Starting in the Southwest, potentially record-breaking heat is set to reach the East Coast by the end of the week. New York City is forecast to reach 90 degrees by Friday \u2014 just in time for the Big Apple's busiest tourist season. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

The former president was among the speakers at a Business Roundtable event in Washington, DC, attended by Wall Street titans including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan, and Citigroup chief Jane Fraser. Stephen Moore, an economic advisor to Trump, said Apple CEO Tim Cook had a front-row seat at the event, Reuters reported. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee laid out his economic agenda as part of an hourlong conversation with the conservative commentator Larry Kudlow, per The Financial Times. Trump promised to consider cutting the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 20%, The Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with Trump's remarks. The FT reported that Trump also emphasized deregulation and a desire to use tariffs as a \"negotiating tactic\" with other countries. Joe Biden, Trump's likely opponent in November's election, did not attend the Business Roundtable event as he is attending the G7 summit in Italy. Standing in for the president, Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, emphasized the administration's efforts to rebuild the economy in the aftermath of the pandemic and said the Federal Reserve's independence has boosted US capitalism, per AP. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Trump allies are drawing up plans to wrest control over some monetary policy decisions from the central bank. While the former president's reputation on Wall Street hit rock bottom in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots, top CEOs have softened their tone on him in recent months. Dimon was highly critical of Trump when he left office but said earlier this year that the billionaire businessman \u2014 and now convicted felon \u2014 had been \"kind of right\" on some issues, including NATO and immigration. Correction: June 14, 2024 \u2014 An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Biden's chief of staff. It is Jeff Zients, not Ziets.

This one simple, cheap amenity should be in every room.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/every-hotel-room-should-have-amenity-power-outlet-travel-adapter-2024-6","description":"The Balmoral in Edinburgh was the first hotel I've stayed in that offered complimentary travel adapters in every room.","date":"2024-06-14T12:15:02Z","content":"The past few times I've gone overseas, my trip has begun in a frenzy. Without fail, shortly before I leave for the airport, I remember I need a power adapter. So with my bags already packed, I frantically research what kind of adapter I need and tear through my drawers to find one that will (hopefully) work. I've always found adapters slightly mystifying. Sometimes, they work; sometimes, they don't. Sometimes, I think I have one that's compatible with a country's outlets, only to find out it won't fit. So when I checked into the Balmoral in Edinburgh, Scotland, last month, I was thrilled to find one sitting on the desk, awaiting my arrival. In my time as a travel writer, I've stayed in hotels around the world \u2014 from five-star accommodations to airport chains.  I've stayed in hotels with Michelin-starred restaurants and members-only cigar clubs, and yet I found this simple, cheap amenity to be one of the most helpful. It sounds silly: Wouldn't the best amenity be something a little more\u2026 luxurious? Of course, the Balmoral had its share of fancy services. It has a fitness center that would make gym buffs swoon, and a scotch bar with hundreds of whiskeys. These are the things that help a five-star hotel earn its rating. But I think some of the best hotels are those that predict a traveler's every need. We've come to expect snacks and drinks in our rooms for when we're feeling peckish or slippers for the morning walk to the shower. It's only natural that this kind of thoughtful treatment should apply to the more granular parts of a hotel stay. Having a travel adapter at my disposal felt like one less thing to worry about when I got to Edinburgh. I could charge my phone or start work right away instead of having to head out on a hunt for an adapter (which I have done before). A spokesperson for the Balmoral told me that the adapters are in every room in the hotel. Guests don't get to keep them, but they're useful during the stay. The adapter, despite being so simple, was exactly the kind of smart amenity I think every hotel should have \u2014 five stars or not. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

He isn't a fan of dogs, so the date went nowhere.","date":"2024-06-14T11:07:01Z","content":"I used to pretend to like people's dogs. From a young age, I learned it was socially unacceptable not to want to rub their bellies and tell them they're \"good boys.\" Unfortunately, I wasn't talented at feigning interest in humans \u2014 nonetheless, four-legged animals. But I didn't expect my ambivalence toward dogs to be a dealbreaker in my adult dating life. I remember dating a guy, who I had noticed on Grindr for a while and manifested into messaging me. I used to suck at hitting on people first. Long story short, we had a couple of great nights out until he finally invited me over. \"There's someone I want you to meet,\" he said. \"Oh,\" I replied, deciphering if the vibes indicated a roommate or partner. Instead, a large furry creature from hell came slobbering all over me. \"Nice,\" I said, easing my way to the couch. My date tried to put the moves on me with the dog going apeshit around us. This was not a threesome I could get on board with, so I asked him if he could put it in the other room. \"It?\" he asked, taking his hand off my crotch. I quickly corrected myself, \"He!\" \"She,\" he said, but more lightheartedly, resuming position. It was a familiar situation. By this point, I knew people didn't like me to refer to their dogs as objects. But I thought it was creepy that they wanted me to treat animals like children unless we were hooking up. I reminded David about putting the dog away, and he obliged. The next day, he wanted me to accompany him and the dog to the park. I confessed I wasn't the biggest dog person, and he ghosted me. I felt like being part of the LGBTQ+ community freed me from having kids, but as I entered my late 20s, I noticed many gay men seemingly waking up with the sudden maternal instinct to adopt a pet. The pandemic exacerbated the dog problem in America. Well, I suppose it's only a problem for me and folks who don't watch where they step. Don't get me wrong: I don't hate dogs. I think it's a fine decision to take ownership of an animal \u2014 feeding them and cleaning up after their excretions daily for the rest of their life. But, as glamorous as it sounds, I don't share the innate obsession with dogs many people seem to have. I always considered my way of being preferable to the people who stop every dog owner on the street and speak to their creature in baby language, with no regard for the stranger in front of them. I'd like to blame my disinterest on my childhood Rottweiler, who pounced on my back when I was about 5 years old and smashed my head into the concrete. But truthfully, I just don't care for pets beyond acknowledging they are adorable. Just as I'd prefer someone to compliment me without tousling my hair, I give animals the same respect. That's frustratingly not good enough for some of my partners. Recently, I went on a first date with a 23-year-old who brought his Golden Retriever with him. It was my first time going out with a younger guy \u2014 and sober \u2014 so the animal humping my leg was about to send me into relapse. The Meat Loaf song lyrics \"I will do anything for love\" played in my head, \"but I won't do that.\" The 23-year-old chatted away. Hearing all the nonsense that came out of his mouth, oblivious to the literal horndog below us, assured me it wouldn't have worked anyway. I've learned that you can't force relationships the hard way, so I accept when my indifference toward pets might turn their parents off, even after sparks are in the air. In affairs of the heart, it always saves time to be politely direct. Ironically, some say it's why animals, especially cats, like me. My friend once had me babysit Queen Suzy, an 18-year-old Chihuahua, for a month while she visited her mom in Europe. This included providing the rebellious four-legged royal medicine with a syringe twice daily and constantly changing her diaper. This is my biggest secret: If I love you, I will begrudgingly love your dog, too. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

In a complaint filed earlier this month, the FAA asked the court to enforce payment of $81,950 in civil penalties as a result of the July 2021 incident. The suit said Heather Wells was flying first class from Dallas\/Fort Worth to Charlotte, North Carolina. \"After ordering a Jack Daniels (neat) during the beverage service, Defendant became increasingly agitated and 'wanted out' of the plane,\" it added. The suit then claimed that she moved toward the back of the plane, kneeled in the aisle, and crawled around \u2014 before telling a flight attendant she would \"hurt him\" if he didn't get out of her way. Wells then reached the front of the plane where she tried to open the cabin door in midair, the suit said. It added that she hit a flight attendant in the head as they tried to restrain her. The suit said two flight attendants and a passenger used flex cuffs and duct tape to restrain Wells. But as she kept spitting and attempting to bite or headbutt people, they also duct taped her mouth, it added. The FAA is asking for financial penalties consisting of up to $45,000 for aggressive behaviors toward the flight attendants, $27,950 for attempting to open the cabin door in-flight, and $9,000 for interfering with a crew member's duties. Notably, 2021 was by far the worst year for unruly passenger incidents, with almost 6,000 cases per FAA data. Such incidents rose nearly five-fold immediately after the pandemic. While the figures have since decreased, they remain roughly double pre-pandemic levels, prompting the government to remind fliers about potential fines.

Buffett's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, owned about 790 million Apple shares worth $135 billion at the end of March, company filings show. Apple stock has soared by 25% since then to a record $214 at Thursday's close, valuing it at $3.29 trillion and just ahead of Microsoft. That means Berkshire's 5.1% stake is now worth $169 billion, assuming it's still intact. The result is that Buffett's slice of Apple is worth more than all but the top 45 companies in the S&P 500, according to MarketBeat data. In other words, if Berkshire's slice of the iPhone maker were a public company, it would be more valuable than Verizon ($167 billion), American Express ($160 billion), IBM ($155 billion), Uber ($148 billion), Nike ($142 billion), and many other blue-chip businesses. Berkshire's position has jumped in value by about $34 billion this quarter. That reflects broader investor optimism about the stock market and economy and fresh buzz around the tech titan following its embrace of AI tools such as ChatGPT this week. Yet it's worth noting that Buffett and his team pared their Apple wager last quarter by 13%. Their previous 905 million shares would have been worth $194 billion at Thursday's close \u2014 a figure larger than the market capitalizations of Accenture ($189 billion), Cisco ($184 billion), and both Disney and McDonald's ($183 billion each). Buffett explained why he cut back on Apple during Berkshire's annual meeting in May. He wanted to realize some of his profits in anticipation of the US government raising taxes to tackle its ballooning debt. He added that holding cash wasn't the worst idea at a challenging time for the global economy. The investor may also have been wary of relying too much on Apple. That single holding accounted for more than 40% of Berkshire's $336 billion stock portfolio at the end of March and makes up nearly a fifth of Berkshire's $876 billion market cap. Buffett probably left billions of dollars on the table by cashing out some Apple shares last quarter, but he won't mind too much. Berkshire's cost base for the holding was $31 billion at the end of 2021, its annual report for that year shows, suggesting the company's made more than five times its money on paper.

While In-N-Out is slowly expanding, it's still largely a West Coast chain, with around 400 locations in eight states and territories. The chain also has no immediate plans to come to the East Coast anytime soon, much to the chagrin of many fast-food fans.  McDonald's, on the other hand, is both nationwide and global, with about 34,000 McDonald's locations around the world.  I tried the same order from In-N-Out and McDonald's \u2014 a double cheeseburger, fries, and a soft drink \u2014 to see which was the better meal.  Here's which fast-food burger meal I'd order again. My meal cost $9.15, not including tax, which I thought was a good deal considering the amount of food I received. To keep my burger similar to the burger I tried from McDonald's, I ordered it with onions, pickles, and spread. It cost me $4.90, which I thought was an excellent deal for the large burger sitting in front of me. The burger patties were much thicker than other burgers I've tried at a similar price point, including the McDonald's burger. The bun on the burger was pillow-soft. I also enjoyed the special sauce, which had a creamy yet tangy flavor. I thought the West Coast chain really nailed the double cheeseburger, and of all the burgers on In-N-Out's menu, this is the one I'd probably order again. The burger's toppings made it very flavorful, it was large but not too big, and it was shockingly inexpensive. That said, the regular fry cost me only $2.15, which I thought was a good deal. The inside was also not fluffy at all, which I thought gave them an odd texture. Overall, I was just slightly underwhelmed by the regular fries, an opinion that I happen to share with other In-N-Out diners. The meal from McDonald's came to $14.37, not including tax, making it over $5 more expensive than the In-N-Out meal. The double cheeseburger from McDonald's comes with two beef patties, pickles, chopped onions, ketchup, mustard, and two slices of American cheese. The bun held everything together and was a good size, but it wasn't as fluffy as the bun from In-N-Out.  The chopped onions added a lot of flavor, and the burger patties were juicy despite being much thinner than the In-N-Out ones. While the In-N-Out fries were slightly bland, in my opinion, the McDonald's fries were flavorful and perfectly crispy. They were also slightly more expensive at $6.09, which I thought was high, even for New York City prices \u2014 keep in mind that McDonald's menu prices vary by location.  Since In-N-Out doesn't serve many condiments besides ketchup, I decided to eat both fries plain. While the In-N-Out fries were underwhelming without any sauces, the fries from McDonald's held up on their own. While I enjoyed both burgers, the double cheeseburger from In-N-Out simply blew me away. It impressed me so much that I forgot all about the fries. Frankly, the burger was filling enough without them, anyway.  I also thought that In-N-Out was an excellent value, even compared with a larger chain like McDonald's. If I were to eat one meal again, I would definitely go for In-N-Out.

Further attacks could make it untenable as a military staging post, the ISW said.","date":"2024-06-14T14:44:32Z","content":"Ukraine's sustained attacks against Russia's air defenses could make occupied Crimea untenable as a military staging ground, war analysts said. In an assessment on Thursday, the Institute for the Study of War think tank said that Ukraine's repeated strikes on military targets in the region were forcing Russia to commit new air defenses. But further strikes, it said, could make it impossible for Russia to prepare or launch attacks from the annexed peninsula. Ukraine has repeatedly hit Russia's air defenses in Crimea over the last few months, with attacks intensifying this week. According to reports, one Russian S-400 \"Triumf\" and two S-300 air-defense missile systems were targeted overnight on Sunday into Monday, with suggestions that Ukraine used US-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS. Two days later, Ukraine launched another missile strike, hitting an S-300 missile system and two S-400 missile systems in Crimea, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. It declined to say what type of missiles were used, but the Institute for the Study of War said they were \"likely\" ATACMS. The strikes seemed to show that Ukraine's older, Western-supplied missiles can get around even Russia's most sophisticated air defense systems, experts told BI this week. Forbes reached a similar conclusion on Wednesday, saying Russia's S-400 missile systems can't defend nearby Russian troops or even themselves. The development could be a major problem for Russia, which has used Crimea as a supply route for bringing troops and gear to the front lines in Ukraine. There are already signs that the country is looking to other routes. Russia has also placed an S-500 missile system in Crimea to protect its air defenses, Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's defense intelligence directorate, said this week, per a translation by the ISW. But despite Ukraine's recent successes, its campaign of long-range air strikes won't be the silver bullet that ends Russia's occupation of Crimea, military experts told BI. Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme, told BI that Ukraine's \"slow-motion successes\" with air and naval operations appear to be making the peninsula \"less and less\" tenable for Russian forces. However, Giles said limited information from open sources makes it difficult to gauge Russia's air-defense capabilities and the extent to which Russian troops are exposed in the region. \"You get the impression that Russia is continuing to deliver new systems to Crimea, and they're being knocked down as swiftly as they're being set up,\" he said. \"But it takes a much more detailed assessment of what's going on to actually establish the real picture.\" Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the UK-based Royal United Services Institute, said that Crimea is mostly out of range of Ukrainian artillery, and even rocket artillery like HIMARS. He said Russia may have to make some tough decisions if it needs to replace lost air defenses, which might mean thinning out defenses elsewhere, but air strikes alone won't be enough to push Russian forces out of Crimea. \"It would take a significant Ukrainian ground push,\" he said, \"to create the kind of pressure.\" And given Crimea's tactical and political significance, Russian forces \"aren't going to withdraw without a major fight,\" he added. \"The kind of casualties they would need to suffer to consider this can only really be inflicted on their ground forces by a Ukrainian ground assault and a large volume of artillery or close-in fire,\" he said. James Black, assistant director of defense research at RAND Europe, made a similar point, saying Russian troops are unlikely to withdraw from Crimea unless their position is rendered untenable. \"Crimea is clearly a major strategic and political priority for the Kremlin, and any withdrawal of Russian forces from the peninsula would be a serious embarrassment for President Putin and his military leadership, both domestically and abroad,\" he said.

So why is it being celebrated in the summer?","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-is-trooping-the-colour-british-monarch-birthday-celebration-2024-6","description":"Trooping the Colour 2024 will occur on Saturday, marking King Charles III's official birthday celebration with a military parade.","date":"2024-06-14T22:54:56Z","content":"King Charles III was born on November 14, 1948, so you likely wouldn't expect him to be thinking about his birthday in the summer. But thousands will celebrate the king's birthday in the UK on Saturday at one of the biggest royal events of the year: Trooping the Colour. According to the royal family's website, Trooping the Colour has been the British sovereign's official birthday celebration for over 260 years. The event is marked with a parade and massive fanfare in June each year. The annual celebration occurs in the summer, regardless of when the reigning monarch's actual birthday is. The royal family's website notes that the chance of the weather being suitable for outdoor activities is higher in May or June. Considering much of the event takes place outside, scheduling it for the summer is easier. Nowadays, the event typically takes place on a Saturday in June. According to History, King George II was the first monarch to move his birthday pageantry to the summer, as he was born in October, but he combined his official celebration with a summer military parade in 1748. The monarch's actual birthday is publicly acknowledged with a royal gun salute, but the sovereign typically celebrates privately otherwise. During Trooping the Colour, a parade of royals and military personnel travels from Buckingham Palace to the Horse Guards Parade at Whitehall in London. The royal family's website states that the parade includes over 1,400 soldiers, 400 musicians, and 200 horses, and the royals typically ride on horseback or in carriages. The monarch can participate in the event from either carriage or horseback. According to the BBC, Queen Elizabeth II rode a horse during the parade until 1987. Once the parade reaches Whitehall, the monarch formally inspects the troops during the ceremony. Likewise, the chosen Regimental Colour, or flag, is carried through the ranks of participating soldiers before they march back to Buckingham Palace. Thousands of onlookers cheer on the participants as they process. According to an FOIA request to the Ministry of Defence, the 2021 Trooping the Colour cost 59,662 pounds, which would be approximately $75,604 today. That total includes stable costs, transportation, and fuel, among other fees, though it does not factor in the cost of the police presence required to keep the event safe for the royals and attendees. Trooping the Colour culminates in a flypast by RAF pilots over Buckingham Palace. The flyover is arguably the most iconic moment of the event, as the royal family watches the planes go by from Buckingham Palace's balcony. Trooping the Colour marks one of the few times a year the royal family gathers in one place, so they are always heavily photographed when they appear on the balcony. The occasion offers a chance to see how royals interact with each other, with people analyzing shots of Princess Diana and Prince Harry in years past. Likewise, royal children often steal the show when they appear at Buckingham Palace for the event. King Charles is set to appear at Trooping the Colour in 2024 despite continuing his cancer treatment. On Monday, he reviewed the Irish Guards in preparation for the event. However, People reported the king will ride in a carriage at the 2024 event instead of on horseback. Queen Camilla will accompany him. Kate Middleton did not participate in the Colonel's Review, a dress rehearsal for Trooping the Colour that she would typically oversee as Colonel of the Irish Guards. However, on Friday, Kate confirmed she would be attending this year's Trooping the Colour, marking her first event since announcing her cancer diagnosis.

Ukraine says it's now deployed to defend against Ukraine's relentless attacks on Crimea.","date":"2024-06-14T20:15:43Z","content":"Russia has deployed its only S-500 air defense system in Crimea as Ukraine ups its attacks on the occupied peninsula, Ukraine's spy chief said this week. The S-500, an advanced system described by Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate as \"experimental,\" has never been used in combat before. Russia moved the S-500 to protect the Kerch Bridge, as well as strengthen Russia's air defense network in occupied Crimea, Budanov said Wednesday. The 12-mile-long bridge, which connects mainland Russia to occupied Crimea, is both a streamlined way for Russian forces to reach the area, as well as a symbol of Russia's control of the peninsula. It's repeatedly been a target for Ukraine's drone boats, bombs, and strikes. Russian air defense assets have also been targets, especially in recent weeks. The S-500, called the Prometheus, is a mobile, surface-to-air defense system designed to intercept ballistic missiles and other ranged weapons. The system is \"essentially a modernized version of the S-300,\" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington DC-based think tank, said Thursday. The S-500 has been tested multiple times but has never been in combat before. Russia has claimed it's able to intercept all weapons, including hypersonic missiles, which are extremely fast and fly unpredictable paths at low altitudes, but that capability remains unclear. Russia has previously claimed missiles were hypersonic that weren't and that weapons were unbeatable that also were not. The S-500's problematic development and production, from the project's start in 2010 to severe delays over the following decade, raised questions about its viability as a system. It was delivered to the armed forces in 2021, though in a limited state unable to meet the requirements for the system. In April 2024, then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that it would enter battle in one of two variations: missile defense and an anti-aircraft role. The S-500's new role protecting the Kerch Bridge and bolstering Russian air defense capabilities in Crimea comes as Ukraine conducts strikes on the peninsula aimed at making the area untenable for the Russian military. Since late May, attacks in the area, particularly targeting Russia's air defenses, have intensified. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have reported major strikes, including one this week, hitting S-300 and S-400 systems. Ukraine is suspected of using US-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, for these strikes, among other capabilities. As Ukraine continues to target air defenses on the peninsula, Russia may deploy more of its air defense assets there, ISW said, \"making them vulnerable to further Ukrainian strikes.\" A fight of this nature could strain and deplete Russia's air defense arsenal. \"ISW previously assessed that Ukrainian forces may be conducting an organized effort to degrade Russian air defenses, which could enable Ukraine to more effectively leverage manned fixed-wing airpower (namely using F-16 fighter jets) in the long term,\" the think tank wrote. Ukraine's strikes into Crimea have long been supported by the US and Western allies but come on the heels of US President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders agreeing \u2014 in some cases, reluctantly \u2014 to let Ukraine use long-range weapons to strike Russian targets in occupied territory. Per ISW, Ukraine could \"in principle\" replicate the success of their Crimea strikes in other occupied areas should Western allies approve such strikes, creating opportunities for Ukraine and degrading Russia's capabilities.

Now, it's agreed to a settlement that would give a stake to those people.","date":"2024-06-14T15:43:17Z","content":"Your face could make you a shareholder in Clearview AI, thanks to the terms of a potential settlement of a lawsuit against the company. The company has agreed to give people whose visages it used to create a facial recognition app a collective 23% stake in the company, The New York Times reported Thursday. Clearview and the plaintiffs suing the company reached the agreement in advance of the class-action going to trial. Clearview used a wide variety of photos of people posted online to develop its technology, meaning that virtually anyone could claim to be part of the class in the lawsuit and claim some of the stake, the NYT reported. Law enforcement officials from local police departments to the FBI have used Clearview's technology, according to the report. The US Army was also a client of the company. Lawyers leading the charge against Clearview argued that the company's approach violated the privacy of people whose photos it used. Clearview opted to offer a stake instead of cash payments since the company could \"go bankrupt before the case made it to trial,\" according to the NYT. The settlement still needs to be approved by a US District Court judge, the NYT reported. \"Clearview AI is pleased to have reached an agreement in this class-action settlement,\" Jim Thompson, a partner at Lynch Thompson and lawyer for Clearview, told Business Insider through a spokesperson. The spokesperson did not respond to a request for further comment on the settlement. The proposed settlement gives people whose photos were used by Clearview a stake in the company's future. Those who claim some of the 23% could benefit if the company goes public or is acquired, for example. Advertisements promoting the settlement would be placed on social media sites like Facebook. But the proposal also contains an irony for the people whose photos Clearview AI used. \"Now you have people who are injured by Clearview trampling on their privacy rights becoming financially interested in Clearview finding new ways to trample them,\" Jay Edelson, a class-action lawyer, told the NYT. Privacy remains a big concern for many as AI rollouts continue. On Monday, Apple executives outlined a plan for AI that they said would protect user privacy as the company added features to its latest operating system. While the company is adding an integration with OpenAI on the iPhone and other devices, for example, customers will have to opt in to use it. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

But while the coverage has focused largely on gold bars from Swiss and South African refineries, the wholesale club's precious metals offering is much bigger. Due to the speed at which these items sell out and the peculiarities of Costco.com's listings, it can be difficult to find details without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Members must log in to see prices for in-stock, members-only items. As a workaround, collectors are tracking a dozen or so other gold and silver products the company has sold on a relatively new subreddit, where they bookmark online links and share tips about local warehouses with supply. Based on spot prices and past comments, the items cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars (for a tube of silver coins) to more than $7,500 (for 100-gram bars of 24-karat gold) \u2014 a range of price points that is likely to appeal to experienced and novice investors alike. While Costco tends to sell gold bars at a very low markup from the market's spot price, coins from the US Mint and Canadian Mint see a slightly higher premium due to their popularity with collectors. As of Thursday, one-ounce gold American Eagle and American Buffalo coins were available for $2,399 each, while the gold spot price was $2,300. In addition, a 20-pack of one-ounce silver US Eagle coins was available for $689, and a set of 25 one-ounce silver coins from the Canadian Mint was priced at $809, compared with a silver spot price of $29 per ounce. Even though Costco doesn't make much profit from its gold business, the company is likely content to keep it up for a few reasons. Pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in sales through Costco.com is a relatively easy way for the company to show strong e-commerce revenue growth. Plus, the items' exclusivity is yet another way to keep existing members happy and attract new sign-ups. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Who rides Caraxes? Here's our guide to all the dragons you should know ahead of \"House of the Dragon\" season 2.","date":"2024-06-14T14:57:43Z","content":"Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"House of the Dragon\" season one. \"House of the Dragon\" season two continues to explore the \"Game of Thrones\" timeline before the likes of Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) were even born. The latest chapter of the HBO franchise will pick up after the events of the season one finale, which saw Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) distraught after the death of her son, Lucerys Velaryon, at the hands of her half-brother, Aemond Targaryen. Although the ending of \"Game of Thrones\" divided audiences, the franchise is still a lucrative property for HBO and Warner Bros., so it's unsurprising that they've expanded the universe with \"House of the Dragon.\" Several other projects are also in development, including the Princess Nymeria series \u2014 titled \"Ten Thousand Ships,\" and \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\" But until those prequel shows come to fruition, \"House of the Dragon\" season two (and the already-ordered season three) will continue to deliver all the political intrigue, raunchy romantic drama, and flame-spitting monsters that fans could wish for. Here's a refresher on all the dragons in \"House of the Dragon.\" Vhagar is the largest dragon in the Targaryens' brood, and the show has made sure to show off how intimidating she is in the few aerial scenes she's had so far. Vhagar is the oldest dragon of the ones owned by House Targaryen in \"House of the Dragon,\" and was previously ridden by Visenya Targaryen during King Aegon I Targaryen's reign years before the series picks up. While Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar in the past, Princess Laena Velaryon (Nanna Blondell) was first to own her in the \"House of the Dragon\" timeline. We even see her flying alongside her husband, Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), as they head back to Pentos. Unfortunately, Laena goes through a traumatic birth in episode six that puts both her and her child at risk, and she forces Vhagar to end her suffering by incinerating her with that all-important phrase: \"Dracarys.\" After Laena's tragic death at the end of episode six, a young Aemond Targaryen (Leo Ashton) sneaks out in the middle of the night to try to tame her dragon, Vhagar. Surprisingly, instead of being incinerated or being turned into a dragon snack, the young boy manages to take control of the largest dragon in Westeros.  Aemond taking Vhagar for himself is also the reason he ends up losing an eye, as a fight breaks out between the Targaryen and Velaryon children, and Lucerys slashes his uncle with a dagger.  An eye for a very powerful dragon? That's one hell of a trade. The pair have another face off at the end of season one, but we'll get to that later. Caraxes might not be the biggest dragon in the gang, but he's longer than most of the others thanks to his snakelike neck. He's also got bright red scales, which gives him a very distinct look. He was originally owned by Aemon Targaryen, the son of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, before the prince's death at the hands of Myrish pirates. Caraxes is owned by the infamous Prince Daemon Targaryen, who constantly rebels against his brother in the series. He even takes Dragonstone (and a dragon egg) for himself alongside his consort, Mysaria (Sonoya Mizuno), and uses Caraxes to intimidate Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) and his forces when they try to oust Daemon from the castle in episode two. However, that doesn't go very well when another dragon shows up... Thankfully, Otto and the soldiers get some dragon backup of their own with Syrax, a yellow dragon of a similar size to Caraxes. She's a much younger dragon compared to the likes of Vhagar and Caraxes, but she's no less vicious. It's one of the reasons that Daemon backs down when he's confronted on the bridge to Dragonstone. Although that might also have to do with who was riding Syrax. Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (played by Milly Alcock as a child) commands Syrax from the beginning. The series shows the formidable teenager riding the yellow dragon in the first two episodes. Her willingness to face off against her uncle Daemon is probably one of the reasons he starts to be attracted to her in the first place. The older Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) later gives one of Syrax's eggs to Aemond, the son of Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke). Vermax is much younger than most of the other dragons in the series and doesn't tower over people like Vhagar, Caraxes, and Syrax. He first shows up in episode six, as the dragonkeepers lead him out to Rhaenyra and Alicent's children. Vermax also has a distinct look, with green scales and a red spine, but he doesn't see any combat in season one. Vermax belongs to Jacaerys Velaryon (Leo Hart), and he's still learning to control the young dragon as he takes lessons from the dragon keepers about how to use the \"dreary\" command. They're clearly paying off because Vermax responds by roasting a goat on command. Poor goat. Seasmoke is another of the Targaryens' dragons, but he's given to the Velaryon family because Princess Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best) married Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), aka the Sea Snake. Seasmoke is a silver and gray dragon, who proves to be a pivotal weapon in the War for the Stepstones. Seasmoke belongs to Rhaenys and Corlys' son, Laenor (Theo Nate), and he's the one who saves Daemon in the War for the Stepstones when he goes up against the Crabfeeder and his forces. Laenor eventually marries Rhaenyra and they have children after the time jump in season one, though their children are actually fathered by Ser Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr). After Laenor's faked death, Seasmoke is currently riderless in Dragonstone. But according to the books, he'll eventually get an unexpected new rider.  Meleys is a very large red dragon and she's been seen a few times in \"House of the Dragon,\" first showing up as she heads to King's Landing next to Seasmoke and Laenor Velaryon. But Meleys is becoming a key weapon against Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) and Aegon Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney). And her explosive entrance in episode nine's Dragonpit coronation scene is one for the ages. Meleys is ridden by Laenor's mother, Rhaenys, who is King Viserys I Targaryen's cousin. She and Corlys are quick to suggest that the king marries Laena when she's 12 years old. Thankfully, he declined and married Alicent instead. It's worth remembering that Rhaenys is also the one who warns Rhaenyra that she is in a dangerous position as successor to the Iron Throne because most men don't want a woman ruling Westeros. Rhaenys proves that she's just as dangerous as anyone else in House Targaryen when she crashes Aegon's coronation with Meleys in episode nine. There's also Dreamfyre. Don't worry if this isn't instantly ringing any bells, because she's only mentioned briefly back in the small council meeting during episode two. Dreamfyre gets name-dropped because Daemon steals one of her eggs that was intended for Rhaenyra's baby brother, Baelon Targaryen, who died briefly after Queen Aemma gave birth to him in episode one. Viserys and Alicent's daughter, Princess Helaena (played by Evie Allen), hasn't become a major part of \"House of the Dragon\" yet. But she will eventually be the one to ride Dreamfyre, as per the 2018 \"Fire and Blood\" book by \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin. No spoilers, but an older Helaena (played by Phia Saban later in season one and in season two) becomes a vital part of the civil war, dubbed the \"Dance of Dragons\" that tears apart House Targaryen. The finale introduces Vermithor, who is one of the riderless dragons living on Dragonstone. It's definitely helpful for Rhaenyra and Daemon to have several dragons that could be tamed in time for a coming civil war. Although Vermithor isn't as big as Vhagar, he's still a towering beast. The finale introduces him when Daemon goes wandering into the caves underneath Dragonstone. Fans who have read \"Fire & Blood\" will know that Vermithor will remain riderless for a little longer. No spoilers, but the person who ends up flying the dragon into battle is from the unlikeliest background. Expect to see a lot more of Vermithor as the Dance of Dragons really kicks off in future seasons. The finale also gives audiences another new dragon, Arrax, a much smaller dragon than many of the others ridden by House Targaryen. He has pearlescent scales with red spines and is a nimble flier \u2014 as seen in the finale when he dives through rocky terrain to escape Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) and Vhagar. Unfortunately, Arrax disobeys his rider by briefly attacking Vhagar, and the larger dragon also ignores Aemond and responds with brutal force. After chasing Arrax for a while, Vhagar kills the younger dragon and his rider with a single chomp with his massive jaws.  It's at that moment that Aemond knows he messed up because Vhagar's impulsive violence causes Rhaenyra to go to war. Arrax belongs to Prince Lucerys Velaryon (Elliot Grihault), and he was given the dragon by King Viserys as a way of dispelling the rumors about him being the son of Ser Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr). But the finale is the first time we see Lucerys and Arrax fly together because Rhaenyra sends them on a diplomatic mission to speak with Lord Borros Baratheon (Roger Evans).  Unfortunately, Aemond got there first, and he tried to get revenge on Lucerys for cutting his eye out when they were children. But Borros intervenes, which is why Aemond takes to the skies with Vhagar instead. Their chase ultimately leads to Vhagar chomping Lucerys and Arrax, which was an accident. But obviously, Rhaenyra doesn't see it like that. Oh dear.

The biggest news is that \"House of the Dragon\" finally returns on Sunday, two years after season one finished airing. If bloodshed and dragon fights aren't your thing, there's also the second half of \"Bridgerton\" season three to catch up on. And if bloodshed without dragons is your thing, \"The Boys\" just returned for season four. If you're in the mood for a film instead, there's Dev Patel's directorial debut \"Monkey Man,\" which he also stars in, or Andrew McCarthy's documentary \"BRATS.\" Here's a complete rundown of all the best movies, shows, and documentaries to stream this weekend, broken down by what kind of entertainment you're looking for. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a Chicago prosecutor suspected of a brutal murder, alongside \"The Worst Person in the World\" breakout Renate Reinsve. Based on the 1987 novel of the same name, the story was previously adapted into a 1990 film starring Harrison Ford in Gyllenhaal's role. Streaming on: Apple TV+ You really can't go wrong with the Peanuts \u2014 and the nostalgia is a great bonus for parents who grew up with it.  This new animated show centers on the beloved character and his band of Beagle Scouts after they find out their troop is on the verge of disbanding. The series is part of Apple's 2018 deal to produce more content based on Charles M. Schulz's series. Streaming on: Apple TV+ Part two of the hit historical romance series got a whole lot sexier. The final four episodes of season three were released on Netflix, bringing a happy ending to Polin's love story, the unmasking of Lady Whistledown, and the reveal of multiple queer Bridgertons. Streaming on: Netflix The sixth season of \"Love Island USA\" kicked off this week \u2014 and this time, \"Vanderpump Rules\" fan favorite Ariana Madix is the host.  (If you're loyal to the UK version, don't worry. The new season of that one is streaming on Hulu.) Streaming on: Peacock Dev Patel stars in and directs \"Monkey Man,\" an action-thriller about an underground street fighter. Patel also co-wrote the screenplay for the film, which is his directorial debut. Streaming on: Peacock \"Hacks\" season three may have ended, but one of its stars is back on the streamer with a new comedy special.  Streaming on: Max The former late-night host kicked off his interview show on the streamer back in 2018. Now in its fifth season, the first episode, released Wednesday, features Letterman's conversation with Miley Cyrus. Streaming on: Netflix House Targaryen is back, along with all its violence and drama. The action ramps up in season two as the Dance of the Dragons is on the horizon. HBO is already so confident in the fantasy series' success that the network renewed it for a third season ahead of the premiere. Streaming on: Max The satirical superhero series returned for its fourth season on Thursday. The first three episodes are out now and have already given fans plenty of Easter eggs and references to the \"Gen V\" spinoff to mull over before the next episode airs in a week. Streaming on: Prime Video The new documentary focuses on members of the Brat Pack, the name given to a group of young actors, including Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, and Rob Lowe, who starred together in many of the most iconic teen coming-of-age films of the 1980s. It's directed by Andrew McCarthy, another Brat.

Besides watching his rival Sam Altman get a leg-up in the AI race with the Apple-OpenAI team-up, Musk was also hit by a sprawling piece from The Wall Street Journal \u2014 and a bombshell lawsuit \u2014 both of which contained new allegations about his behavior with staffers at SpaceX. But it looks like something is finally going his way. The billionaire said on Wednesday night that the shareholder votes to pass his huge pay package and to reincorporate Tesla in Texas were \"passing by wide margins.\" \"Thanks for your support!!\" Musk said in an X post. Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Thanks for your support!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/udf56VGQdo The package was once valued at $55.8 billion, but is now worth about $45 billion following a sharp decline in Tesla stock this year. It's unclear where Musk obtained the screenshots he included in his X post. But the final results of the vote are set to be announced at a shareholder meeting at Tesla's headquarters in Austin on Thursday. Winning both votes would be a huge boost for Musk, who's pulled out all the stops to woo Tesla shareholders. Aside from campaigning on his social-media platform, X, Musk has also offered shareholders the opportunity to go on a personally guided tour of Tesla's Gigafactory in Texas. Musk even sought to turn what's been widely viewed as a disadvantage \u2014 running half a dozen companies simultaneously \u2014into an advantage. The billionaire spent his weekend pitching shareholders on the benefits of having Tesla as a part of his sprawling business empire, also known as the \"Muskonomy.\" He's also argued that a Musk-led Tesla would not only allow the electric-vehicle giant to use technology from his other companies but also grant shareholders access to his future IPOs. \"I've mentioned something like this before, but if any of my companies goes public, we will prioritize other longtime shareholders of my other companies, including Tesla,\" Musk said on Saturday. \"Loyalty deserves loyalty,\" he added. But Musk's overtures to shareholders ran into a speed bump on Tuesday when The Wall Street Journal published an extensive story about his sexual advances to female employees at his rocket company, SpaceX. And a day later, Musk was hit with a lawsuit from eight former SpaceX employees. The lawsuit, filed in California, accuses Musk and SpaceX of wrongfully terminating employees after they raised concerns about sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Representatives for Musk and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.

It's helped me gain perspective about aging.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/age-gap-friendship-different-generations-benefits-2024-6","description":"Having a friend from a different generation has helped me gain perspective about things. We go to the gym together regularly and text every day.","date":"2024-06-13T14:03:01Z","content":"About a month ago, I was sitting in a caf\u00e9 with my friend. I'm not one to fret about aging, but I was having some feelings about turning 35 that week. The number felt very much like approaching middle age and leaving the youthful chaos of my 20s and early 30s behind. \"Don't worry. If I could go back to any age, it would be my 40s,\" Dorian told me. I knew this wasn't just a shallow platitude. Dorian is 26 years older than me, so if she was telling me that the best was yet to come, I believed her. It immediately made me feel better. Not for the first time, I was so happy to have a friend of an entirely different generation to give me the perspective I just can't get from my peers. I met Dorian back in 2021 when I joined a CrossFit-style gym. The world was opening up after quarantine, and I knew virtually no one in the town I'd moved to in 2019. I joined the gym largely for a social outlet. The mid-morning group classes drew a mixed crowd. I was in my early 30s and usually the youngest person there. There were a few parents in their 40s, with kids similar ages to mine (who were 4 and 8 at the time), and people in their 50s and 60s. Out of everyone, I really clicked with Dorian. I can't explain why \u2014 she was one of the quieter people in the class and we were never partners for exercises. Maybe it was her \"Gym and Tonic\" t-shirt that made me laugh or her \"Zookeeper\" vanity license plate that reminded me to embrace the wilder moments of life. Perhaps because we couldn't bond over the frustrations of parenting, we were nudged toward more meaningful topics. If she were closer to my age, I would have suggested Dorian and I get a drink or do a lake day with the kids, but I felt funny moving our gym friendship into the real world because of our age gap. Looking back, I think I was worried she would think it was odd. Really, my hesitation was just a good old fear of rejection. Luckily, fate intervened. In the summer of 2022, our gym suddenly changed its model. Many of the customers felt like the rug had been pulled out from under us, so we started a co-op-style training program at a different local gym. During the switch, the mid-morning class size dwindled. Often, it was only Dorian and I working out together. That's when our friendship blossomed. Since we were a duo rather than a group, we really got to know each other. When my daughter's pony died unexpectedly, Dorian hugged me while I cried and made burial arrangements. When she was overwhelmed with helping plan her daughter's upcoming summer wedding, I let her vent and reminded her it would all turn out perfectly. Despite seeing each other at least five times a week, we never mentioned our age gap. I figured Dorian was about 20 years older than me, but at this point, it didn't matter at all \u2014 we were buddies. I asked her about plants, and she tried to help me overcome my brown thumb. We shared recipes. We gossiped and giggled over small-town dramas. Then, in 2023, I was talking about planning a surprise 60th birthday celebration for my mom. Dorian responded that she hoped to slip quietly out of her house on her upcoming 60th. Turns out, my new best friend was almost exactly the age of my mom. We also have the same age difference between me and my oldest daughter. Yet, that difference doesn't matter at all. If anything, it enhances our friendship. We're not brought together just by shared circumstances or obligations. We've formed a connection just because we like each other. When we get coffee, go for a walk, or spend a day on the dock at Dorian's lake house, we can enjoy spending time together just because. On the day of my 35th birthday, Dorian handed me a card. It had the silhouette of a powerlifter squatting on the front, and she'd drawn a ponytail to make the card look a bit more like me. I had recently made a longtime squat goal, so this was perfect. Seeing how well Dorian knew me made me, I so appreciated her friendship, and that we didn't let our age gap get in the way. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

No one tells you how hard it is.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/having-kids-mid-30s-working-mom-miscarriages-2024-6","description":"Business owner Harriet Kelsall delayed having children in her 20s and early 30s to build her business. She struggled with multiple miscarriages.","date":"2024-06-13T10:22:00Z","content":"I've never been someone who was always thinking about kids, but I assumed I might want them someday. I got married at 28. By 30, I was ready for kids, but I was also running my own business, Harriet Kelsall Bespoke Jewellery, which I started at 27 in 1998. My business grew quickly, and I had staff relying on me to pay their wages. When I thought about having kids in my late 20s, it didn't seem possible while running a business. My mom was a stay-at-home mom until I was 12. My friends and family with young kids were all stay-at-home moms and had the kind of jobs you could put down for a year and come back to. I would need childcare from day one and couldn't understand what that would look like, so I kept putting kids off. I wondered if eventually I'd have to choose between my career and children. When I was 34, my husband and I decided to try for a baby. I was getting older. Speaking to a work friend who had juggled having kids and her full-on job made me realize I could handle it, too. I also started researching nannies and realized that was a feasible option. I got pregnant quickly, but I had a miscarriage at four months. I thought maybe I'd left it too late and that I wouldn't be a mom. But I got pregnant again a few months later and had my first child when I was nearly 35. I started working again about a week after my son was born. At that point, there were certain things that only I could do for the business. I remember people coming to my house so that I could price gemstones and work on commissions. I had a screaming baby in one ear, and I was trying to hold it together while I worked. It was difficult, but I managed. 18 months after our son was born, we tried for another baby. We needed start trying before I got too much older, especially already experiencing one miscarriage. I also didn't want a huge age gap between my kids. When I had my son, two colleagues stepped up in a way I hadn't anticipated. That made me feel more confident that my business could would work when I had a second child. I kept getting pregnant and then losing the baby. I had eight miscarriages over three years. It was really hard and physically draining. Each time, I lost a lot of blood. Once, I had to have a transfusion of four units of blood. It was tough juggling my business while going through a lot of emotional and physical pain. I didn't feel I could tell my staff about my miscarriages or lean on them for help. I had this false notion that as a female leader, I couldn't show weakness. I felt very lonely. During that time, I had to find a lot of strength inside myself carry on. Even though I wanted my son to have a sibling, I remember thinking: \"I have this amazing baby, and some people don't even have one, so I'm very lucky.\" I didn't have time to wallow in the reality of what I was going through. My sister was also very supportive. Having so many miscarriages meant that trying for a baby was getting scarier and scarier. At one point I thought \"This is the last time we should try.\" Thankfully, I then got pregnant with my second child, and she was born when I was 39. Getting pregnant and having two healthy kids when you're over the age of 35 is hard. Many people manage it, so it doesn't sound difficult, but unfortunately, not everybody can have kids later. You don't know if that will be you until you try. I've also found that having kids in your mid- and late 30s is a real physical challenge. Even if you keep fit, the reality can be quite different. Childbirth is draining on your body, and it takes a while to recover. Once you have a baby, you're tired all the time. In those early days, I felt like I'd done four hours of exercise each day. If I hadn't had kids or so many miscarriages, it's possible my business might be further on. But I think parenthood can bring a lot to your work. It makes you a better leader and better at juggling things. It bugs me people think when a woman goes on maternity leave, they're going to fall behind. Every woman I know who is brilliant comes back to work even more brilliant. The unknown is scary so make a plan for how you're going to juggle your work when you have kids. Talk to your partner and research childcare options \u2013 finding a nanny, looking into costs to see if I could afford it, and finding out what hours they could do helped to reassure me. My advice to others who are thinking about having children would be to make sure that your work is in a sustainable position. Think through all the ideal scenarios and what you'd want to avoid as a working parent \u2014 things like your location and working hours, and if what you need is possible. I don't regret my choices. I love my amazing children and running my business. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights.

Social media made it a major success.","date":"2024-06-13T12:48:46Z","content":"After spoiling him rotten last year, McDonald's has completely ignored Grimace's birthday in 2024. The McDonald's mascot made a comeback in 2023 when the burger giant released a limited-edition Grimace Shake to celebrate his birthday on June 12.  The fuzzy purple blob, believed by some to be a taste bud or a milkshake, became an internet sensation as TikTokers posted videos of themselves pretending to be injured or even dying after drinking the shake. The trend generated huge buzz for McDonald's, which sold the shake as part of the Grimace Birthday Meal. The mascot's 52nd birthday celebrations appeared in a number of social media posts by the chain in June and July, before McDonald's said that it was \"time to say goodbye\" on July 5. Since then, Grimace has barely appeared on McDonald's social media. It was his birthday again on Wednesday, and the chain was completely silent. The Grimace Shake is back on menus in Canada, but Americans have been left empty-handed. Fans are confused and upset. They've been commenting on McDonald's latest Instagram post, which promotes its Grandma McFlurry, to ask whether the Grimace Shake is returning. On TikTok, dozens commented on McDonald's most recent video on Thursday to wish the mascot a happy birthday. McDonald's reaped the success of Grimace's birthday promotion last year, with Gen Zs scrambling to get their hands on his birthday shake so they could join in the viral trend. \"It quickly became one of our most socially engaging campaigns of all time with millions of reactions on our social media posts, a true demonstration of how the power of our brand emerges in organic and creative ways in our fans,\" McDonald's CFO Ian Borden told investors last year. \"It contributed to the strong double-digit comparable sales growth for the quarter in the US.\" If McDonald's was hoping it could replicate the success of the Grimace Shake with this summer's Grandma McFlurry \u2014 which also plays on feelings of nostalgia \u2014 then it's got another thing coming.

His current flagship is a Boeing 757-200 airliner converted for VIP use. The 757 is an aircraft without equal. Since its launch in 1982, it's been one of the most capable, versatile, and respected aircraft in the skies. However, Trump's retrofit of the airliner as a business jet was recently questioned in an article that turned its nose up at the plane, calling it \"crappy\" and \"dilapidated.\" While the article did make some good points \u2014 purpose-built business jets have more comfortable cabin pressure and can operate out of smaller airports \u2014 the author's disdain for its owner, whom I'm ambivalent toward, bled over into an unnecessarily harsh characterization of the plane. There's a common saying in the business-aviation industry: The private jet isn't a luxury; it's a time machine. The point of a private jet is to save its occupant time and increase their productivity. Time is money, and the time saved by flying private instead of commercial is worth more than the extra cost. From that perspective, the 757 is probably not the most cost-effective or efficient corporate jet for a globe-trotting business mogul. The jet burned through $2.6 million worth of fuel from 2023 to 2024. A purpose-built Gulfstream or Bombardier Global is certainly a better option. Both are newer and more efficient, and they have the range to reach pretty much any destination in the world. But neither can match the sheer presence and drama of arriving at a destination in a VIP airliner. And they don't look nearly as good behind a campaign stage. And for a consummate self-promoter like the Donald, there's no better private jet than a three-story, 155-foot-long flying billboard covered in the Trump logo. The marketing and brand value created by the flying billboard trumps the added cost of operating a decades-old airliner, equipped with two bedrooms and a dining room, all lined in 24-karat gold. In fact, Trump once said in a documentary that the plane was \"very much an extension of the Trump brand,\" The New York Times reported in 2016. The jet, dubbed Trump Force One, has been a fixture at campaign stops ahead of the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections. Trump acquired the 757, registration N757AF, from the Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen in 2010 to replace his older Boeing 727. N757AF was originally delivered to the defunct Danish low-cost carrier Sterling Airlines in May 1991. It also briefly flew for the defunct Mexican airline TAESA before the tech billionaire picked it up in 1995. Though the aircraft is now well into its 30s, older, well-maintained planes can operate safely and effectively at that age. According to Airfleets.net, plenty of 757s older than Taylor Swift, born in 1989, are in regular service with airlines and cargo operators like DHL, FedEx, and Delta. Trump's 757 spent nearly a year in the hangar, receiving a full refurbishment and a new paint job before returning to service in late 2022. Trump isn't alone in his preference for the VIP airliner, and his 757 is far from the biggest or most over-the-top. The rapper Drake flies around in an even larger VIP airliner, a 1996 Boeing 767-200 wide-body. The Qatari and Saudi royal families operate private Boeing 747 jumbo jets. As an airliner, the 757 was a true tweener in Boeing's lineup \u2014 a twin-engine, narrow-body airliner that's bigger than your run-of-the-mill 737 but smaller than a wide-body like the 787 Dreamliner. In airline service, the 757-200 has the range and performance to easily brave the headwinds across the Atlantic on long-haul flights from Paris to New York. As a narrow-body, it'll happily shuttle passengers on 45-minute flights to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure to support a wide-body. But what stands out the most about the Boeing 757 is that it's the muscle car of the airline world. With power from a pair of massively powerful Rolls-Royce RB211 (or Pratt & Whitney PW2000) turbofan engines, each producing upwards of 40,000 pounds of thrust, the Boeing 757 has developed a reputation among pilots as an aircraft with the grunt to take off from airports in hot weather or at high elevation that would sideline many of its more modern rivals. But the power and versatility that helped it stand out from the crowd also doomed it. Even during its heyday in the 1980s and '90s it was ahead of its time and arguably much more airplane than most airlines needed. By the early 2000s, a smaller Boeing 737 or Airbus A321 could handle most of the 757's duties at a lower price. The availability of cheaper, more efficient alternatives, coupled with sky-high oil prices in the years following 9\/11 and an airline industry on financial life support, meant the 757 was a nonstarter for carriers. After years without landing a new order for the plane, Boeing discontinued the 757 in 2004. In total, 1,050 Boeing 757s were produced over 22 years. The final 757 rolled out of Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, in October 2004. The aircraft was delivered to Shanghai Airlines in April 2005 and now flies for Delta Air Lines as N823DX.

A chat with tech analyst Ben Thompson","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-deal-openai-chatgpt-tim-cook-sam-altman-who-wins-2024-6","description":"Who has the power in the deal between Tim Cook's Apple and Sam Altman's OpenAI? I asked tech analyst Ben Thompson. He explained who has the leverage.","date":"2024-06-13T14:41:25Z","content":"The tech world has had a few days to digest Apple's big AI announcement, and there are still lots of questions unanswered. Like, for starters: How big a deal is it for Apple to get into AI? And how risky is it for Apple? And who has the power here \u2014 Apple, or its AI partner OpenAI? When I try to get my head around big, complicated tech questions, I often rely on Ben Thompson, the influential tech analyst who writes the Stratechery newsletter. So I called him up to talk it through. Thompson's main takeaway is that Apple is using its leverage as a phone maker to make AI companies \u2014 in this case, OpenAI \u2014 do much of the expensive and difficult work. And that Apple gets the upside of AI without incurring many of the costs and risks other tech players are taking on. But it's worth reading Thompson's comments at length. The following is an edited excerpt of our conversation. You seemed pretty enthusiastic about Apple's AI efforts before they announced them on Monday. You seem even more so after the fact. What do you like about what Apple showed off? I think what's so compelling is actually how little they're doing. This entire moment is about generative AI. And I'm not sure people quite realize that Apple's not really doing any generation. They do have image generation, which is fairly tightly constrained. But [primarily] they are leveraging this capability to do interesting things that were not possible previously, like tying together different vertical apps. I thought the most compelling demo was the presenter getting the message from her mom about her plane arriving, finding the dinner reservation that was in an email, getting information about real-time flight data, and incorporating that all together. It just resonates because that's a real problem that people have. It felt like Apple at its best: \"We're not selling whiz-bang technology; we're selling thoughtful solutions that are super obvious once you see them.\" I thought that really came through. And it sidesteps a lot of the challenges around generative AI. Like hallucinations, like getting stuff wrong. They're basically just handing that off to OpenAI. And it's going to be branded OpenAI. And you're going to be [told] you're going to OpenAI. And if it screws up? Well, go talk to OpenAI. The reason why this is compelling, and why I was optimistic even before the presentation, is that it speaks to their position in the value chain. They own the interface where people conduct their lives. And that gives them the luxury of solving problems only they can solve. And then having an interface for the folks that want to spend billions of dollars to do these huge large language models, to plug in and sort of take it or leave it \u2014 it's Apple leveraging their position of being the trusted device in people's lives, and getting everyone to dance to their tune. You mentioned hallucinations, which people understand comes with AI. The Washington Post asked Tim Cook about them, and he said he couldn't promise there wouldn't be any. But it sounds like you're saying the hallucination problems are going to be from the OpenAI queries. And they'll be OpenAI's problems. I think the hallucination bit is maybe overrated. It's something that's very easy to sort of latch on to, like glue on pizza. It's very funny and kind of embarrassing. But if you go to ChatGPT.com, you go into it knowing it might come up with something weird. And actually, 99% of the time, it doesn't. And [OpenAI] is very confident, and I think it's reasonable to be confident it's going to continue to get better in that regard. And the fact of the matter is 100 million people, or whatever it is, are still using it despite these dangers. Which speaks to the tremendous utility that does exist. But back to the airport scenario. That sounds great, right? But what if \u2014 whether it's a hallucination or a more basic error \u2014 I rely on Apple to tell me when I'm picking Mom up, where we're going, and they get it wrong? Isn't the risk there much, much higher than a garden-variety hallucination? Yes. I would say this is the No. 1 risk facing Apple. I think there are two risks Apple faces. One is some massive AI breakthrough, such that the phone becomes the commodity, as opposed to Apple making the AI the commodity. Like: Who's commoditizing who? That one is TBD and somewhat out of Apple's control. But it's worth mentioning. The real risk is execution risk. Apple does have the luxury of coming to market later, and they benefited from a huge amount of research and improvements. Like shrinking down these models, giving them high efficiencies so they can run on-device. They've had all those benefits. What they are proposing to do \u2014 to actually orchestrate different apps and different bits of data \u2014 no one has done well, yet. Apple's bet is they can do it well because they have the data, because they are on the device. But there is a real execution risk. There is so much of AI that demos well and dies down on the edge cases. And there's a gazillion edge cases. So to the extent this does not work out and does go badly, [the risk] is there. Apple is not a fast follower here. They are a leader. And whether this is a place that they have the skills and capabilities to lead effectively is by far the biggest open question. Do you take Apple at face value when they say this tech only works on our latest, greatest, highest-end machines? 100%. The No. 1 constraint in running these models is memory. And every single device that supports this has 8 gigabytes of RAM as a minimum. That's just the long and short of it. I think this is evidence, honestly, about how Apple was late. To develop phones, the whole process runs over several years. I think if they could go back in time, they would have made the base iPhone 15 have 8 gigabytes of RAM [so it could run the new AI features]. Do you think this spurs device sales? That's obviously the question Wall Street's wondering about. I think so. And I think it doesn't just spur device sales. I think it potentially spurs higher ARPUs [average revenue per user]. I'm very curious if Apple's going to actually ever start talking about RAM. Because RAM is the key constraint here. If you got a phone with more RAM, you could theoretically run a better model. Are they going to talk about that such that you don't just upgrade your phone but you actually spend more, to get a higher-end phone? There's definitely the opportunity to do that. You've been speculating about whether Apple is paying OpenAI, or OpenAI is paying Apple. There's no real reporting out there about the arrangement between the two companies. Does it matter in the end whether Apple is cutting a check for several billion dollars or getting a check for several billion? I don't think it matters. I think it's more interesting as to what it says about the relative power in this value chain. In my initial article, I assumed Apple would be paying OpenAI. After the keynote, and [seeing] the degree to which OpenAI was diminished \u2014 it's just a link, basically, and they're going to warn you every time you go there, and there was no Sam Altman onstage, and this was all Apple stuff \u2014 that made me feel like Apple could have done the exact same presentation without OpenAI. And just say, \"If you want to do chatting, open an app.\" Because of that, I think that they're in a stronger bargaining position. And my guess is there's just no money changing hands at all. (Editor's note: Following my interview with Thompson, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg reported that, as Thompson suggested, neither company is paying the other, though they both imagine the deal could generate revenue by getting iPhone users to sign up for paid services sold by OpenAI.)

Cloud computing could be a long-term fix.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/cloud-computing-could-fix-the-fashion-industrys-transparency-problem-2024-6","description":"Cloud computing could allow fashion companies to share sustainability information and create a less wasteful supply chain.","date":"2024-06-13T15:18:37Z","content":"Across the fashion industry, companies are steeling themselves for the potential passage of the EU Green Claims Directive, which could happen as early as next year. The directive would require brands making sustainability claims to back them up with evidence and to label products accordingly. The GCD would have global implications, as it would extend to all businesses advertising to EU consumers. The GCD still faces multiple hurdles, but if passed, it would force long-overdue change in the industry. Under the directive, consumers should be able to visit a website or scan a QR code to see proof of a garment's fabric composition or how it was created. But before that can happen, brands need to be able to source and share sustainability data internally and with retail partners. Cloud computing could be key to doing this in a detailed and efficient way. Cloud computing offers on-demand services, from storage to software, over the internet. It's been billed as a major cost-cutting measure for companies because they can pay for the services they need, rather than rely on in-house servers. It's also a way to streamline processes by collecting data into one easily accessible hub. The cloud-computing industry is growing rapidly, and analysts predict it could more than double in value between now and 2029. And the fashion industry has gradually been waking up to the potential of cloud computing. In recent years, heavyweights like Mulberry and Net-a-Porter have begun working with Eon, a cloud-powered tech company that specializes in Digital IDs, QR-code labels that can be scanned for detailed information, product authentication, and customer-focused extras, such as suggestions on how to style the looks. Meanwhile, DressX, which allows users to \"wear\" digital garments in photos and videos, uses Google Cloud. Still, there's been little focus on cloud computing when it comes to sustainability data. Bharati Rathore, a management lecturer at the University of South Wales, is one expert who's spreading the word. In her report, \"Fashion Transformation 4.0: Beyond Digitalization & Marketing in Fashion Industry,\" she said that the fashion industry must embrace new technologies in order to survive. Rathore said cloud computing is a way to \"store and manage large volumes of data efficiently \u2014 everything from customer preferences and purchasing behavior to inventory levels and supply chain details.\" She added that it offered a central place for data sharing, making it easier for workers around the world \u2014 design teams and retail managers, for example \u2014 to stay up-to-date with each other. If harnessed properly, cloud computing is one of a handful of digital tools that could \"revolutionize the way we design, produce, and consume fashion,\" Rathore said in her report. It's no secret that the fashion industry has historically shied away from transparency. This is slowly changing, thanks partly to companies like Fashion Cloud, an insights platform that works with over 700 fashion brands and 25,000 retailers. Using cloud computing, Fashion Cloud collects data and insights, and then makes them easily accessible for all parties \u2014 from website designers, who upload and describe products onto brand websites, to retail managers, who handle shop-floor operations. The company works with brands from the mass-market online retailer Zalando, which averages around 50 million customers per quarter, to Studio Anneloes, a Dutch design house that features a \"footprint\" tab on every product that indicates its environmental impact. \"Fashion is a terribly old-fashioned industry,\" Alies ter Kuile, the cofounder of Fashion Cloud, said. \"Every retailer has their own process, so nothing is standardized. What we do is ensure retailers are getting key product and sustainability data from brands, and we help brands on that journey, too.\" The GCD is intended to be a crack down on greenwashing and vague, hard-to-substantiate claims of \"eco-friendly\" clothes, but it's a huge hurdle for brands accustomed to opacity. According to ter Kuile, only 50 of the brands that Fashion Cloud works with \"share sustainability data in an automated way.\" Meanwhile, she added, \"another 350 have the sustainability data, but they can't share it yet.\" Communication is a core issue when it comes to letting customers know exactly where their clothes come from. \"Brands and retailers are asking for the same information,\" ter Kuile said, referring to where the clothes were made and how many units have been sold. \"But they're currently doing that in different spreadsheets. We're trying to automate these processes.\" Simplicity is key, too. Ter Kuile said the average age of fashion buyers \u2014 retail reps who decide which pieces are stocked in department stores and online shops \u2014 is between 50 and 60. \"Typically, the people using our tools are people who don't like software, so everything needs to be intuitive,\" she added. \"You can't have five different brands with five passwords \u2014 forget about it! The process has to be the same, and it has to be simple.\" Cloud computing also provides key benefits for retailers. \"For fashion retailers, quick, data-driven decisions are essential for inventory management, store expansion, and market adaptation,\" Alan Holcroft, the UK manager of Cegid, a cloud-computing business, told Business Insider. Cegid supports over 85,000 retailers, including the French fashion retailer Cot\u00e9lac. Easy access to buying data means retailers are more likely to purchase only what they can realistically sell. For example, if a dress has moved only 10 units in one location in a month, it's wildly unrealistic to buy 500 and expect them to be sold. With cloud computing, retailers can avoid overbuying stock \u2014 a key driver of fashion's textile-waste problem. (It's no secret that brands would sometimes rather set fire to unsold stock than discount their prices.) None of this is to say that cloud computing is inherently sustainable. Steven Gonzalez Monserrate, a cloud anthropologist, said in a 2022 research report that data storage has a \"greater carbon footprint than the airline industry.\" Cloud computing is reliant on data centers, which require energy-intensive air conditioning to prevent servers from overheating. These centers also require irrigation, sometimes guzzling up water resources needed by local communities. There are still many fashion brands that seem ill-equipped to address the GCD's requirements. Ter Kuile said part of the problem is that too many conversations in the fashion industry focus on abstractions rather than action. Data-sharing through cloud computing \u2014 while by no means perfect \u2014 is a practical step that allows information to be tracked at every level of product creation and, crucially, shared with customers who need it. \"We don't need inspiration to be more sustainable and transparent,\" ter Kuile said. \"We need processes that enable us to actually do it.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

The European Commission confirmed Wednesday that Tesla \u2014 which manufactures EVs for the European market at its Shanghai gigafactory \u2014 may receive its own special rate of tariffs. The Musk-run automaker had lobbied for a lower tariff rate than its Chinese rivals, according to Bloomberg, pointing out that it had received fewer state subsidies from the Chinese government than companies like BYD and Geely. A spokesperson for the European Commission told CNBC looking at the subsidies Tesla has received in China \"may lead indeed to different level of countervailing duties.\" It's unclear if Tesla would benefit overall as the tariffs will likely be relative to the subsidies it has received. It comes as Tesla warns customers in Europe that it may have to hike prices of the Model 3, which is manufactured in China, as a result of the tariffs. Business Insider contacted Tesla and the European Commission for further comment but didn't immediately hear back. The EV giant does have a gigafactory in Germany, where it builds Model Ys, but it imports its Model 3 sedan into the EU from China. Tesla imported more EVs into Europe than anyone else last year, shipping in 171,000 cars compared to Chinese rival SAIC Motor's 118,000, according to HSBC data reported by Bloomberg. The EU announced a new barrage of taxes on China-made electric vehicles on Wednesday, after provisionally concluding that the amount of money China has poured into its EV industry gave China-based companies an unfair advantage. Warren Buffett-backed BYD, which briefly overtook Tesla as the world's largest EV producer earlier this year, was hit with a 17.4% import tax, while Geely and SAIC Motor were hit with rates of 20% and 38.1%, respectively. Other China-based firms cooperating with the EU's investigation will face a 21% duty, while those that refused, will be hit with a 38% tariff. These new tariffs are on top of the EU's existing 10% duty on imported EVs. Tesla has been manufacturing in its Shanghai gigafactory since 2019, and has benefited from Chinese government subsidies meant to boost the country's EV market. In 2022, it received the second highest amount of subsidies for the production of its EVs behind BYD, according to Bloomberg analysis of industry data.

They are one of 40 million Americans experiencing food insecurity.","date":"2024-06-13T10:03:01Z","content":"Mary Dacus, 69, fills her basket at Ruler Foods with the essentials. Three cans of SpaghettiOs for $1 each, a dozen eggs for $2.99, a half gallon of milk for $2.59. She adds bread, soup, potatoes, chili mix, graham crackers, cereal bars, clementines, toilet paper, some frozen vegetables, and canned chicken \u2014 the fresh stuff is expensive. It comes to $83.02. Dacus goes shopping near her home in Robinson, Illinois \u2014 a city 200 miles south of Chicago \u2014 on the fourth Wednesday of every month after her husband Stephen cashes his Social Security check. She hopes the food will last them a full 30 days, but she inevitably has to stop at Walmart a few times to fill in the gaps. Granola for $5.34, bell peppers for $2.88, two bottles of butter pecan coffee creamer for $7.94, and a new vacuum bag for $8.77. That's an additional $53.39. Dacus and her husband have to stick to a tight budget: their household only receives $23 a month from SNAP. They must rely on their combined $2,140 Social Security income for the rest and any other expenses they have since they're both retired. The average American household spends $475 a month on groceries plus $303 on restaurants and takeout, according to the latest available US Bureau of Labor Statistics report on consumer expenditures in 2022. There are over 40 million Americans experiencing food insecurity. SNAP provides relief for many households living paycheck to paycheck. But some struggling families, like Dacus', don't receive enough help, or their income is considered too high to receive any help at all. ALICEs \u2014 people who are asset-limited, income-constrained, employed \u2014 feel especially left behind by food assistance programs. According to the Pew Research Center, about 13% of Americans, or 22 million households, are enrolled in government food benefits. Anything helps, Dacus said, but her SNAP allocation \"barely covers one meal.\" \"The man called me and told me, 'Oh, we're going to get you $23 a month.' And I laughed,\" she said. \"That's pitiful. That's really pitiful.\" Dacus is a good cook \u2014 she used to love making pot roast when she could afford it \u2014 and can usually make a meal out of whatever miscellaneous ingredients she and Stephen have in their cupboard. She typically makes crockpot meals, casseroles, or other dishes that she can stretch for more than one meal. But $23 a month in food benefits isn't even close to affording what they need to eat. Often, Dacus said a full month of food and household products can run them about $200, plus an additional $30 to $50 a week when they run out of things. They struggle with their other household bills, are in nearly $10,000 in credit card debt, and have drained their savings in order to pay for food and healthcare. \"We've used our credit cards within the last three and a half years to buy groceries and things that we needed,\" she said, adding that she and Stephen's low credit score has now made it difficult to qualify for housing and car payments. To avoid going hungry, Dacus said she has to rely on local food pantries. They pick up canned goods and packaged food. But there aren't many food pantries near her house, and the ones in driving distance are open for limited hours. Even when they can go to the pantry, Dacus said the food is unhealthy and sometimes spoiled. America's SNAP program provides low-income households with money to grocery shop, and the qualifying criteria is based on the federal poverty line. The allocation can also be affected by earned-income taxes, and the number of children or older adults in a household. What's more, the costs of groceries can vary widely based on a person's location. An individual with a monthly gross income lower than $1,580 can receive a maximum of $291 monthly from SNAP, and a couple with a monthly income lower than $2,137 can receive a maximum of $535, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Yet, many households like Dacus' don't receive the maximum because their income isn't low enough. There are also limitations on how SNAP dollars can be used. The money covers basic food products like milk and bread, but it cannot be used to purchase dish soap, toilet paper, laundry detergent, vitamins, feminine products, over-the-counter medicine, or pet food. Groceries are just part of the $38,268 the average couple in Robinson, Illinois needs to survive every year, which includes the cost of housing, utilities, healthcare, transportation, and unexpected expenses, according to United Way. For a family with two school-age children, that number becomes $61,632. This budget doesn't leave any room to build savings or prepare for retirement. It's also more difficult for childfree adults, or adults whose children are no longer minors, to qualify for food assistance. Dacus said she and her husband have to rely on SNAP and food pantries because she can't access other programs like WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), the child tax credit, and parts of the earned-income tax credit. \"We don't get ahead at all,\" Dacus said. \"We take two steps forward and three back.\" Are you experiencing food insecurity?

But it comes with a massive risk.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/saudi-seeks-china-neom-mbs-investment-risk-vision-crown-prince-2024-6","description":"Saudi Arabia is brokering closer ties with China. But the alliance is of growing concern to Saudi's main geopolitical ally, the US.","date":"2024-06-13T15:37:58Z","content":"At a recent exhibition in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia showcased its futuristic vision for its planned Neom megacity. Among the exhibits were designs for The Line, a sprawling residential structure consisting of two skyscrapers that were originally intended to house nine million people. It also showcased plans for a network of underground tunnels that residents could use to travel between different regions and a desert ski resort in the mountains. It was part of Saudi Arabia's drive to secure billions in new investment for the project, which is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 strategy. Vision 2030 is meant to reorient the kingdom's economy away from fossil fuels and toward innovation and technology. But the vast scale and cost of the project, which reports say could spiral to more than a trillion dollars, is posing difficulties even for Saudi Arabia, despite its reserves of oil wealth. The exhibition helped make Neom \"less mysterious,\" but reactions were \"mostly neutral,\" Leonard Chan, chair of the Hong Kong Innovative Technology Development Association, told AFP. There remain hopes in Saudi Arabia, however, that China will invest billions in the project. One of the main areas of recent cooperation between the states has been technology, with Saudi Arabia working with China on AI and surveillance tech projects as it seeks to transform itself into a tech superpower. Robert Mogielnicki, an analyst at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told Business Insider that Chinese investors likely see opportunities in Neom in sectors including construction, renewable energy, telecommunications, and smart city-related services. \"Chinese economic actors interested in Neom likely see a longer-term project pipeline with various opportunities to generate profits,\" said Mogielnicki. But it's an alliance of growing concern to Saudi Arabia's main geopolitical ally, the US. One of the main tools China's leader Xi Jinping is using to broker alliances globally, particularly with nations ambivalent about the West's insistence on human rights, is the prospect of access to China's sophisticated surveillance technology. China has developed AI-enabled face recognition software that allows officials to monitor citizens in real time and access data on aspects of their private lives, including health, employment, and financial histories. It's a tool with an obvious appeal for Crown Prince Mohammed, who is accused of brutally persecuting dissidents and critics. China sees Saudi Arabia as not just a business opportunity but a way of undercutting the influence of its longtime Saudi ally, the US. In April, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund-subsidiary Alat signed a deal with Dahua Technology, one of China's most important surveillance technology firms. The US has sanctioned Dahua Technology over national security concerns. Unlike Western firms, which have policies to protect data, Chinese companies have fewer compunctions about sharing the information they collect, Camille Lons, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told BI. \"Gulf countries are indeed significant clients of Chinese surveillance technologies,\" said Lons. \"The fact that Chinese companies are more open to share the collected data than their Western counterparts makes them attractive partners to the Gulf states.\" It's an aspect of China's involvement in Neom that's alarmed some critics. Neom is being designed as a \"smart city,\" whose services will be regulated by data collected from residents through smart phones or surveillance cameras. Last year, analysts told BI that data collected about Neom residents through Chinese technology could be used as part of a mass surveillance program. \"They're being marketed as 'eco cities' or 'smart cities,' we call them surveillance cities,\" said Fatafta, of cities such as Neom whose infrastructure uses Chinese data services and surveillance technology. Saudi Arabia's increasingly close ties with China are of growing concern to the US. The Biden administration is seeking to broker a normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel and is offering the Saudis potential access to valuable nuclear technology. An alternative deal would offer the Saudis enhanced US security guarantees. But as a condition for any agreement, the US is demanding that the Saudis restrict their new tech alliance with China. \"The main risk today to Saudi Arabia's tech cooperation with China is the growing China-US tech war. The US is increasingly putting Riyadh under pressure over its cooperation with Chinese companies in the tech sector,\" said Lons. The US is concerned that China could seek to exploit its relationship with Saudi Arabia to steal US tech secrets, with chips used to power AI systems among the areas of concern, The New York Times reported. \"US companies are now making clear that if Saudi Arabia wants to access advanced US technologies, it will need to make a choice and prove that it won't serve as a backdoor to China to access those technologies,\" said Lons. But with Saudi Arabia reportedly considering scaling back some of its flagship Neom projects amid funding concerns, it will likely continue walking the tightrope between closer ties to China and potential US repercussions as it seeks to supercharge its Vision 2030 plans.

The series starts by examining Shinn and his followers of the Los Angeles-based church from the perspective of Melanie Wilking, a dancer who believes that the organization brainwashed her sister, Miranda Derrick. Derrick joined the church in 2021 and later signed with Shinn's talent management company, 7M Films Inc, which he started that year. Derrick has maintained that she is not a victim following her family's claims that she cut contact with them after joining the church. But while Derrick and her husband, James \"BDash\" Derrick, are still involved with Shekinah, other dancers have left the church. The Netflix series paints a surprising picture of how content creators can potentially be taken advantage of while trying to build their brands and find success. In 2022, a 7M representative denied all allegations of coercion in a statement to Business Insider, saying \"at no point\" has Shinn tried to isolate anybody. Here are all the TikTok dancers who have been involved with 7M, Shekinah Church, and Shinn. Wilking spoke at length about her concerns about Shekinah Church in the first episode of the documentary, and said that she attended a few sermons with her sister. She also recalled being invited last minute to a Sunday service by Shinn's daughter, Kloe Shinn. Kloe Shinn asked Wilking to cancel her pre-arranged plans so that she could attend the service immediately. \"I just remember thinking, 'No! I'm not doing that.' I've gone to different churches growing up and no one is ever like 'You have to be here, now'\" she explained. \"After Kloe did that, I made up my mind that I was never going back.\" Much of the documentary explores the Wilking family's claims that Shinn and Shekinah Church have brainwashed Derrick. After its release, the dancer called the documentary \"one-sided\" in a statement on Instagram. Following the release of the documentary, Melanie Wilking told her followers that she'll always be there for Derrick if she decides to leave the church. That suggests she is still part of the church. \"We believe that one day my sister and the other victims will realize their love for their families and faith was exploited,\" she said. \"When that happens, we will be there for them without judgment.\" It's unclear when James \"BDash\" Derrick and Miranda got married, but the couple posted photos of each other in wedding outfits in April 2024 after being together for two years. They continue to make TikTok videos together so, although unconfirmed, it seems likely that Derrick is also still involved with Shekinah Church. \"Dancing for the Devil\" features footage from TikTok and YouTube of Derrick's content, but like his wife, he does not personally appear in the documentary. Aubrey Fisher started attending services at Shekinah Church shortly before Shinn founded 7M Films in 2021. In the documentary, he explained that the pastor was impressed that Fisher had a similar number of followers to BDash, and claimed that Shinn started the management company after their conversation. Fisher left Shekinah and 7M in 2022 between May and July, but it's not clear when he and fellow TikTok dancer Kylie Douglas separated. Fisher continues to make dance videos on Instagram and TikTok, and also produces his own music. In the second episode of the documentary, Douglas claimed that Shinn created a culture of paranoia among his followers. She said that she felt she couldn't even fully share her thoughts with Fisher in case they somehow got back to Shinn. As detailed in the series, she left the church with Fisher between May and July 2022, because of Shinn's worrying behavior and due to the allegations that Shekinah is a cult. Douglas continues to work with her own dance company in Los Angeles, The Voltz. Nick \"RainO\" Raiano joined Shekinah and 7M at the same time as Fisher and BDash in 2021. His parents are a big part of \"Dancing for the Devil,\" and they said that he slowly cut contact with them after he joined the church. When Raiano started to respond to texts again, his parents suspected that someone else at the church was writing the messages for him. Since the documentary was released, Raiano has deleted his Instagram and TikTok accounts. His main YouTube channel has also disappeared, although his old account with one video is still available. Kevin \"Konkrete\" Davis partnered with BDash in 2018 and they auditioned together on talent shows including \"America's Best Dance Crew\" and \"World of Dance,\" as seen in the documentary. He and BDash joined Shekinah in 2021 after they worked with Shinn's son, videographer Isaiah Shinn. Archive footage in the documentary shows that he left in July 2022 following the reports that Shekinah was a cult. Konkrete regularly makes krump dance videos on TikTok and Instagram, and also makes his own music. After the documentary's release, he told his followers that he \"appreciates all the support.\" Kailea Gray joined Shekinah with her then-boyfriend, Konkrete, and left the church with him in July 2022 following the allegations. In the documentary, Konkrete claimed they were asked to sign NDAs after going to church, which they were shocked by. The pair have since gotten married, according to their Instagram accounts, and they make content together. Ukrainian-born Vik White is mentioned in \"Dancing for the Devil\" as a member of Shekinah, but it isn't clear whether he also distanced himself from family and friends because of the church. In 2024, he had a minor role alongside Nicholas Galitzine as Simon, a member of the August Moon boyband, in Amazon's \"The Idea of You.\" He continues to make content with the Derricks on TikTok and Instagram. Ceasare \"Tighteyex\" Willis is signed with 7M, but isn't featured in \"Dancing for the Devil.\" On June 7, he made a YouTube video about his work, where he also alluded to the documentary by promising to provide \"real context\" about the \"stories that you hear.\" Although he didn't mention anyone in particular, the video included footage from Konkrete's livestream where he was discussing Tighteyex. Later in the video, Tighteyex cryptically said that people he knows are lying about him, seemingly referring to Konkrete. He added: \"If you are being slandered or people are talking about you or lying on you, it comes from people that you know. Kendra \"KO\" Willis is another dancer signed to 7M. She's married to Tighteyex. It's unclear whether the couple attends Shekinah Church, but she made a subtle dig at \"Dancing for the Devil\" on Instagram when promoting her own documentary.

So what will be the legacy of his successor, Tim Cook? The Apple CEO said he hasn't given it much thought \u2014 and it's for others to decide. Cook spoke to tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee in an interview released Wednesday, saying that \"legacy is something that is defined by other people.\" While he's content with letting the public determine his own, Cook said his focus is looking forward, not dwelling on the past. This mirrors Apple's ethos, he said, especially amid its recent major announcements at WWDC 2024 earlier this week. \"You won't find a museum here,\" Cook said. \"We would have lots of things that you might like to see and reminisce about, but we just don't.\" And Apple doesn't have much time to reminisce \u2014 it's been playing catch-up in the AI arms race in recent years since the launch of ChatGPT. But the wait to see what Cook had up his sleeve is over, now that Apple introduced Apple Intelligence, its suite of generative AI tools baked into the operating systems of its most popular devices. For Apple, it could mark the beginning of a new era, and how Cook navigates the AI race could impact his legacy. He's also overseen the launch of the Apple Watch and AirPods, growing sales from Apple's wearables business to the size of a Fortune 200 company, and built up Apple's services business with the launch of Apple TV+. Most recently, he introduced Apple's first major new product category since the Watch: the Vision Pro. Apple is betting \"spatial computing\" is the future, and with the long-rumored Apple car project reportedly scrapped, the Vision Pro is \"one of his last big swings as Apple CEO and will affect his legacy,\" Bloomberg's Mark Gurman wrote last year. It's not clear when Cook will end his tenure at Apple, but he's said the company has a succession plan in place and in 2021 predicted he wouldn't still be CEO in 10 years. Last year, he told Dua Lipa in an interview that he doesn't plan on stepping down anytime soon, but that he wants his successor to come from inside Apple. Cook acknowledged in the interview with Brownlee that, eventually, his time would come. \"At some point, there will be another CEO,\" Cook said. \"And my whole focus in life will be on making them successful.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

Taylor Kimberly and his family.  But after studying ultra-processed foods in more detail, and seeing how they affect the brain, he's switched to grilled chicken instead. Kimberly, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, is the senior author of a new study linking ultra-processed foods to health risks like dementia and stroke. \"Since we began this study, I've paid more attention to what I eat,\" he told Business Insider. \"But I'll be honest, there are many I enjoy, and I haven't eliminated them all.\" While it's not news that ultra-processed foods are linked to poor health, the latest study helps us understand not just which foods might be healthy or unhealthy but how to make small, healthy changes without cutting them out entirely. \"Ultra-processed foods are such a big part of our diet. They're convenient and easy. There hasn't been as much work on thinking about not just the type of food but also how it's processed,\" he said. The findings, published June 11 in the journal Neurology, are a step closer to helping scientists understand why processed food might be bad for our health. The study was observational, which means it can't directly tell us if processed food caused the health risks. But it does offer hints at simple ways to make healthier choices, according to Kimberly, who offered tips on picking more nutritious snacks and how much processed food you should aim to cut back on. When Kimberly and his team embarked on their study, their goal was to come up with some actionable advice for people. Is it possible to slightly reduce processed foods \u2014 without eliminating them entirely \u2014 and meaningfully improve your health? Their research suggested you can. Their study found that a 10% increase in processed food consumption was linked to a higher risk of cognitive impairment. That's the equivalent of about two meals per week. The research team based their analysis on that amount because it felt like a realistic amount for people to reduce, and an easy goal to remember. \"The answer we came up with is that we move the needle, and we can take a lot of optimism from that,\" Kimberly said. \"Diet is really hard to change. There are many reasons we eat what we eat, such as time, convenience, and budget. All of these things impact the dietary choices we make,\" he said. Years of research tell us that processed foods are harmful in part because they're often lacking in fiber and protein, as well as vitamins and minerals. They also introduce unhealthy ingredients into your diet, such as added oil, sugar, salt, and preservatives. That means you can't offset the consequences of a junk food diet by popping some multivitamins or gulping a green juice afterward. \"If you're not eating a healthy meal, you're also eating an unhealthy meal, so the evidence suggests you can't just add a supplement. It's both sides that are important when thinking about brain health,\" Kimberly said. The good news is that replacing highly processed foods with healthier alternatives can give you double the benefits because you're adding nutrients and cutting out potentially harmful additives at the same time. For example, swapping French fries for baked sweet potatoes helps to reduce salt and oil in your diet but also brings in more vitamins and minerals. Kimberly's research has inspired him to snack on nuts or carrots instead of cookies or crackers \u2014 cutting his sugar intake and quickly increasing the amount of fiber in his diet. \"We're not just feeding ourselves when we eat. We're feeding a really complicated ecosystem in the gut that helps metabolize what we eat,\" Kimberly said. You don't have to give up processed foods completely to improve your health. When you're reaching for something cheap and convenient, it can help to choose healthier processed food options that have recognizable ingredients, according to Kimberly. \"If you look at it and think, that could be made in my kitchen, that's a good indicator,\" he said. In the long run, it can be more helpful to make a few small swaps you can stick to than trying (and failing) to swear off processed foods forever. \"In a perfect world, we would all eat unprocessed foods, but that's not reality,\" Kimberly said. \"It's not a sprint. Short, big changes aren't the goal. Even modest changes, if they're sustainable, can matter.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Some of them are downright enviable. He hung out with comedy legends Chevy Chase and John Candy while filming his first starring role in \"National Lampoon's Vacation,\" became the muse of 1980s auteur John Hughes with \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" and was the youngest \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member ever after joining the show at 17. But some of them are less so. Hall's 1986 film \"Out of Bounds,\" his attempt at becoming a dramatic leading man, was a flop. He was part of what's regarded as one of the worst \"Saturday Night Live\" seasons of all time. Hard-partying forced him to step away from Hollywood. It's enough stories for a lifetime \u2014 and all of that happened by his mid-20s. Now 56 and with the dreaded transition from teen star to adult actor decades behind him, Hall has added many more memorable roles to his credits: he played Bill Gates in the 1999 TV movie \"Pirates of Silicon Valley,\" popped up in Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight,\" and went toe-to-toe with Michael Myers in \"Halloween Kills.\" Soon, he'll add another to the list: a sleazy politician who gets on Jessica Alba's bad side in the Netflix action movie \"Trigger Warning,\" out June 21. For the latest interview in Business Insider's \"Role Play\" series, Hall opens up about his partying days, why he turned down the lead role in Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket,\" and his plan to make a \"Succession\"-like comedy series with his good friend Robert Downey Jr. \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" was your first movie, and the ending was reshot. As a kid, was it strange to do a reshoot? We did the reshoot for \"Vacation\" six or nine months later. The funny thing is that puberty had fully kicked in for me. I'm literally seven inches taller. So if you look at the movie closely, you'll see that my hair is darker, and I got taller and skinnier. The first day on set for the reshoot, I see Chevy, and he sees that I have one or two giant pimples, and he goes, \"If you're going blind, you're doing it right.\" He was just messing with me because, seeing how I looked, he guessed I had started masturbating. Chevy was like that.  And the other thing was I learned John Candy was going to be part of the reshoots. I used to watch \"SCTV,\" so I loved him, and one of the sketches he used to do was the Schmenge brothers with Eugene Levy, they were Polish variety show hosts. So I brought that to John's attention, and he said, \"We're going to make you an honorary Schmenge, Michael,\" he would talk to me like his Schmenge character. That's how cool he was. He really was like Uncle Buck.  Is it true you did 10 auditions for the Ted role in \"Sixteen Candles\"? I think so. It was in that range.  Was John Hughes at all of them? I believe he was at all of them. As well as Jackie Burch, the casting director. But the thing was that with every successive round of audition, they would add more executives from the studio showing up.  So you would feel good if the room filled up more and more. Exactly. I felt I was getting closer to landing the job because they kept asking me to come back and do the same scenes, and there would be more and more people.  Do you think you and John clicked through that process, or was it not until filming started? I think it was actually through the audition. Because I felt like he was rooting for me.  Is it true that you were the one who cast John Cusack for the role of Bryce, one of Ted's geek friends? Yes. And that was at John Hughes' direction. He literally said that to me one day. He said, \"They are going to be your buddies in the movie, so I want you to cast them.\" I was stunned. I was a 15-year-old kid. I couldn't believe he said that. So I cast John and Darren Harris.  By the time \"The Breakfast Club\" came out, you were one of the biggest teen stars in Hollywood. What was that like for you? I was excited and stunned. I think when it started to kick in for me was even before that, it was when we had screenings of \"Sixteen Candles.\" I remember John was doing post-production on \"Sixteen Candles,\" and he wanted to show it to me. I went to the Waldorf Astoria with my father to see John, and he showed it to us on VHS in his beautiful penthouse suite. I remember tripping out because I was watching the movie, and I really laughed and thought it was funny. That marks the beginning of when I felt something was starting for me.  By the time \"The Breakfast Club\" came around, he had called me at home. This is six or eight months later because he did \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"The Breakfast Club,\" and \"Weird Science\" consecutively. My parents gave me the phone, and he just told me about the movie and my part, and that's how I got involved with that. We would always call each other and talk over the phone, just as friends.  We have to talk about 1984 to 1986 because that is a defining moment in your life and career. You were on \"Saturday Night Live\" as the youngest cast member ever at 17 years old. You were finishing up \"Weird Science,\" and were looking to do your first dramatic role with \"Out of Bounds\" after declining to play the lead in Hughes' \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" You were living in the Chateau Marmont with a giant billboard of \"Weird Science\" right outside your window. You were flying back to New York weekly for \"SNL.\" And, on either coast, you were partying with the likes of Robert Downey Jr. and Mike Tyson. What the heck was life like for you then? Dude, it's like you were there the way you just described that! That was startling. No, it was incredible for me. I remember taking a meeting to do \"Out of Bounds,\" and at that point, I felt personally I was riding the crest of these three John Hughes movies, and I was loving it, but part of me wanted to move forward, and that's why I chose that film. It was a chance to step in a new direction after three comedies. And, yes, I was going back and forth to New York to do \"SNL\" because my deal for the 1985 season was not like the other cast members \u2014 I only did like 13 or 14 episodes while everyone else did 20-22. It was a whirlwind.  A whirlwind for sure. Looking back, did you burn both ends of the candle? It was a lot to deal with, absolutely. And we're talking about the age of 15 to 20. I'd done all those films and \"SNL,\" and truthfully, yeah, those were my partying days. I grew up in Manhattan, so it wasn't something I had to reach for. It was always right there. I certainly had my wild nights. But I feel by the time I was in my mid-20s it shifted because I had to reinvest in my craft and take it seriously and rebuild.  I have to bring up one more thing from this time span: Stanley Kubrick calls you to play the lead in \"Full Metal Jacket.\" Oh, shit. Yeah. Is it true that there was a nine-month negotiating period to determine whether you were going to sign on for the role of Joker? That's right.  But set the record straight, because you have said different things over the years: Did you walk away because of the money being offered, or was it the character and the amount of time you'd have to dedicate to the role? Here's the thing: I remember I had to go to Kubrick's lawyer's house, who lived in the Bel Air section of Beverly Hills. I was with my father. He escorted me into his kitchen, and I sat down and read a script that was numbered because Kubrick was extremely private, and I read \"Full Metal Jacket.\" But it was such a long and drawn-out process. At one point, I remember the lawyer calling my father, and Kubrick had a question for my father; he wanted to know if he had read a book called \"Nuclear Negotiations,\" because that's how long these talks were going.  But to answer your question, and it's a good one, I think it was about not just the money but what it represented. He really wasn't giving me a legitimate deal. And because I did my research, I knew that I'd be working for a year on that movie. In fact, I happened to run into Matthew Modine a year and a half later, and I asked him, \"How long did you guys shoot?\" And he was like, \"54 weeks.\"  So it was about the money. We couldn't come to an agreement on the deal and that's ultimately why I walked away. If I have anything close to a regret in my career, it would be not doing that movie. But I'm not a person who lives with regret, so I feel I grew from that experience. And I wound up having a conversation with him after all that.  With Kubrick? Yeah. It was really interesting. He basically told me he had a lot of budgetary restraints, and I talked to him about that. Unfortunately, it didn't work out, but I was able to have two conversations with the man: at the beginning, when he offered me the role and he talked about his influences like Chaplin and Russian films, and then at the end. The whole thing was an interesting experience.  You took some time off after \"Out of Bounds\" and reemerged as the bully Jim in Tim Burton's \"Edward Scissorhands.\" Was it a confidence boost for you when that movie became a hit? It totally was. I remember I got a meeting in New York with Tim. I was super stoked to see him. A modern-day Walt Disney. He was super laid back at the meeting. He was soft-spoken and really chill. And I was in my early 20s by then and had another growth spurt, so I think he loved that coming off the John Hughes movies and people knowing me as the geek from those, he thought it would be interesting to cast me in that Jim role. Basically, to go against type.  We shot in the Tampa area. I'll never forget: I went into his office, and he had all the drawings for \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" on the wall. So he was thinking about that even though he was in production on \"Scissorhands.\" And he would come so alive once he was on set. He's so calm and reserved, but on set, a switch flips and he comes to life.  You have worked with many greats. How do you compare Christopher Nolan when you worked with him on \"The Dark Night\"? He's up there. Hughes. Burton. Nolan, I love, too. With the scale and the scope of the movie, I always just went with what was on the page; I never tried to improvise. I remember on set, he always wore the same thing: jeans, a vest, and a lengthy jacket. He looked like a conductor. He had a uniform, it seemed. He was kind of like a pied piper because, with every shot, there would be a trail of four or five people behind him. I heard you and Robert Downey Jr. developing something together. We are. I can tell you that we are in development; it's been years. We wrote a TV series together, we're calling it \"Singularity,\" and it's based on an idea Downey had. It's taken a while because, at a certain point, we had to change things because it wound up being too similar to \"Succession.\" What I mean by that is I would have played one of three sons, and the father was this tycoon industrialist. It's more of a comedic tone than \"Succession,\" but it mirrored it too much, so we had to change things. Downey and I actually had a Zoom session the other day with a top producer who will hopefully come on board.  Would Downey be on camera alongside you? He is willing to do that. He might direct the pilot and some other episodes along with being in it.  Would you direct some episodes?  I would love to. This is really Downey's idea, so he's committed to being a part of it.  You've had so many different eras of your career. Is there anything else you still want to try? Writer-director. I've written something that I really want to make. I would star and direct it. It has been a passion and desire for me to do that for many years now. It's the next evolution in my career, being behind the camera.  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Season four, which debuted with three episodes on Thursday, is stuffed with Easter eggs, nods to the comics, and references to the college-set spin-off series \"Gen V.\" Here are all the details you might have missed so far. This is likely a nod to the supe Mister Marathon. In the comics, he was a member of The Seven who was replaced by A-Train. The character has also previously been mentioned in passing during season two, first by Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) in episode five and then by Lamplighter (Shawn Ashmore) in episode seven. At the election night party, Homelander (Antony Starr) tells Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) not to be scared or intimidated by humans because \"they're only humans and toys for our amusement.\" Later in the episode, Homelander again speaks demeaningly of humans when he tells Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), \"Humans are nothing. They're less than nothing. They're just toys for my amusement, and yet, they control everything. It's unnatural.\" Homelander likening humans to toys comes from the comics. In volume nine (\"The Big Ride\"), Homelander talks to himself in the mirror and says, \"People are toys. They're toys and they're there for my amusement. And there's not a thing more to them than that.\" This is a callback to season two, in which Annie January\/Starlight (Erin Moriarty), Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott), and new Seven member Stormfront (Aya Cash) were grouped together for a female-power-style press campaign called \"Girls Get it Done.\" During a meeting, Ashley tells Homelander, \"After that debacle at Goldolkin \u2014 thank you again for saving my life \u2014 the board felt we should find new candidates for The Seven ASAP.\" This is a direct reference to what happened during the season one finale of \"Gen V,\" which takes place at a college for young supes called Godolkin University. During the episode, students who were being tortured and experimented on in an underground lab called The Woods were freed and unleashed havoc on campus. As the young supes went wild, Ashley called in Homelander to get the situation under control. Ashley presents Homelander and The Seven with a list of 25 supes to choose from to fill the team's vacant seats, including Talon, Hyperion, Dogknott, and Wrangler. Talon and Dogknott are both characters that appear in the comics. The Church of the Collective, run by Alastair Adana (Goran Visnjic), was a big part of season two. After being ousted from The Seven, The Deep joined the church in an attempt to make amends and earn his way back into the supe group. This is another nod to \"Gen V.\" On the show, Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) is a supe with the ability to manipulate magnetic fields and magnetism. He's also a Godolkin University trustee and the father of a student named Andre Anderson (Chance Perdomo). Season four of \"The Boys\" takes place after the events of season one of \"Gen V.\" The end-credits scene of the finale, which shows Butcher investigating The Woods, confirms that he's the person Grace Mallory (Laila Robins)  was speaking to earlier in the season about a virus that can wipe out supes. Billy Joel is one of Hughie's (Jack Quaid) favorite musicians; throughout the show, he references his love for the singer. During season two, Hughie explains that he's fond of Joel because he and his mom, who left him when he was 6 years old, used to have dance parties to his music. Ambrosius (voiced by Tilda Swinton) is an octopus that The Deep met at Herogasm last season and had sexual relations with. Season four reveals that The Deep, who's now divorced, has been secretly stashing Ambrosius in a tank in his bedroom closet. When he's not around to keep her company, the sea creature stays occupied with a small toy of The Deep that she can wrap her tentacles around. Sister Sage is from Detroit, and her power is that she's the smartest person on the planet. Homelander recruits her for The Seven because he's tired of being surrounded by people who are so terrified of him that they agree with everything he says and don't challenge him. Homelander also reaches out to her because he's been thinking about his legacy and wants her help in figuring out how to create the ideal world to leave behind for his son Ryan. In the comics, Jessica Bradley is a personal assistant to Vought-American CEO James Stillwell. After overcoming to difficulties last season, Hughie and Annie are finally in a solid place in their relationship. Later in episode two, when they execute the fake civilian rescue, Ryan accidentally throws Koy too hard, sending him flying into a building to his death. As the channel NNC covers Annie rallying Starlighters and declaring she's back, a news crawl reads: \"Guardians of Godolkin Sam and Cate to join Seven members at V52 Expo.\" The season four trailer for \"The Boys\" includes a quick shot of Sam  (Asa Germann) and Cate (Maddie Phillips) from \"Gen V,\" but it's unclear which episode fans will see them in.

Since hostilities were reignited at the border of Israel and Lebanon in October 2023, the Israeli military has also used drones and white phosphorus munitions in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah, on the other hand, has been firing continuous barrages of rockets and other munitions toward northern Israel. There are concerns that both Israel and Lebanon are at risk of experiencing wildfires due to the exchange of fire at the border and the use of incendiary weapons.

It's always sunny at Business Insider when \"Welcome to Wrexham\" star Rob McElhenney is around. Check out our cover story on the actor-turned-entrepreneur. In today's big story, we're looking at the drama between Tesla shareholders over Elon Musk's bumper pay package that gets decided on today. What's on deck: But first, pay that man his money. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. One of the world's richest men is fighting over how much he gets paid. As funny as that sounds, the battle over Elon Musk's pay package is no joke. Tesla's annual shareholder meeting this afternoon will announce the result of the investor vote on Musk's compensation plan (which was once valued at around $55 billion), but Musk is already claiming an early victory. Business Insider's Grace Kay has the full rundown on what's at stake and how it could play out. On one side sits large investment firms that feel the package is a tad too rich for their blood. They also point to Musk's chummy relationship with some Tesla board members (like his brother) for why the package shouldn't get approved. And they're not alone. A Delaware judge voided the plan in January, deeming it an \"unfair price.\" On the other side are Musk fans, of which there are many. Retail investors hold roughly 44% of Tesla's shares, the highest mark among the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500. From their perspective, the pitch is simple: Trust in Musk. The billionaire is a lightning rod for controversy, but he's turned Tesla's stock into a rocket ship \u2014 2024 aside \u2014 making them rich. And for many shareholders, that's all that matters. The lead-up to today's results hasn't been pretty. Earlier this year, Musk gave investors an ultimatum. Meet his comp demands, or he'll prefer to build AI and robotics products \"outside of Tesla.\" Plenty scoffed at the idea he'd take his ball and go home, leaving Tesla high and dry. But Tesla's board chair hinted it's not an empty threat. To that point, Musk recently diverted a $500 million shipment of Nvidia chips from Tesla to X. Musk, for his part, said the chips were rerouted because Tesla didn't have space for them. The episode points to a common criticism of Musk: He has too many jobs. One longtime Tesla investor said the EV maker is \"kind of the bottom of the pecking pole of Elon's companies.\" Musk has spun that to his advantage, suggesting his business empire is a \"Muskonomy\" that Tesla benefits from being a part of. But that empire came with some negative press this week. An extensive report from The Wall Street Journal made claims about Musk's interactions with female SpaceX employees, including an accusation of asking a direct report to have his babies. SpaceX's chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement to the Journal: \"The untruths, mischaracterizations, and revisionist history in your email paint a completely misleading narrative.\" As for Tesla, plenty view Musk as too intertwined with the company not to meet his demands. Tesla's board chair said while the EV maker could exist without him, it needs him right now. But a billionaire investor who backs the pay package was more direct: Without Musk, there is \"no Tesla.\" What do you think? Vote here on if you're for or against Musk's pay package.

Members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District's board of supervisors pushed through the landmark deal on Wednesday evening during a meeting at its Lake Buena Vista headquarters. The deal comes amid a d\u00e9tente between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration took control of the local tourism district from the entertainment conglomerate last February. Disney had previously self-managed any development in the area with little government oversight. The resulting legal battle between Disney and the DeSantis administration began in 2022 but ended this March when both parties agreed to a settlement. \"This is the day we have all been looking forward to,\" Board Member Brian Aungst said prior to the vote. \"Walt Disney World is inextricably intertwined in the fabric of Central Florida.\" After the vote, Board Member Charbel Barakat thanked DeSantis for his leadership, inspiration, and \"tireless efforts\" to reach a deal with Disney. A representative for DeSantis called the agreement a \"big win\" in a statement to BI. \"Disney and the state of Florida continue working well together under CFTOD's new governance structure, and we are pleased to see CFTOD and Disney reach a new development agreement that secures up to $17 billion in future investment in the state of Florida,\" Communications Director Bryan Griffin said. \"This agreement is a big win for central Florida and will lead to numerous jobs and improved guest experiences.\" The development deal, a version of which Business Insider reviewed, will allow Disney to spend billions of dollars on its Walt Disney World properties over the next 10 to 20 years. It will also permit Disney to build a fifth major theme park and two minor theme parks \u2014 something Disney fans have fantasized about for years. Reddit boards and Disney-themed discussion forums have long speculated about the so-called \"fifth gate,\" or a potential fifth theme park that would join the four existing locations. Disney hasn't discussed how or when it could pursue the massive project, but fans have clamored for a villain-centric theme park in the past. Another popular idea was a Star Wars-based attraction, which came to life in 2019 when Disney unveiled Galaxy's Edge. The development deal also authorizes Disney to add more rooms to its Central Florida hotel and expand its retail and restaurant space. In return, Disney must award at least 50% of its related construction work to Florida-based businesses and fund at least $10 million toward \"attainable housing projects.\" The company must also donate at least 100 acres of its land to the tourism district. In a hearing last week, local businesses came out in support of the deal, which they view as an opportunity to grow the local economy and increase sales. \"The one thing we're sure of is that investment and reinvestment guarantee growth and excellence,\" George Miliotes, the owner and operator of Wine Bar George in Disney Springs, told board members. \"So, when we see the billion-dollar number in front of the investment that's on the table, we get very excited.\" He added: \"We know that we're securing the future if we make this investment.\" Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

For those who have been praying for one of the Bridgerton siblings to get a queer storyline, season three delivered. Benedict Bridgerton experienced his first kiss with a man via a threesome with his paramour, Lady Tilley Arnold. But perhaps more shockingly, the show has staged a queer romance for Francesca, one that promises a deviation from her novel \"When He Was Wicked.\" By the end of season three, Francesca has finally married John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin. At the end of the season, at a ball hosted by Penelope Featherington's sisters, she finally gets to meet another member of John's family \u2014 his cousin, Michaela Stirling, played by Masali Baduza. Book readers will note this as a significant change: In Quinn's novels, Michaela is actually Michael, John's cousin and a close friend of Francesca's after their marriage. He's also Francesca's eventual love interest after John dies suddenly two years into his marriage with Francesca. \"Bridgerton\" doesn't really mince glances in the finale. Francesca is immediately visibly attracted to Michaela, tripping over her words as they meet and even briefly forgetting her own name. Even if you haven't read the books, the implication is clear \u2014 Francesca is going to fall in love with this woman. \"Bridgerton\" has made some significant changes to Quinn's novels in the past \u2014 most notably, it asserted Queen Charlotte's Blackness, and takes place in a version of Regency-era London where people of color can hold titles. But three seasons in, it has yet to meaningfully change any of the siblings' love stories, making a divergence of this level unprecedented. Showrunner Jess Brownell told Glamour that Francesca's story, and feeling of otherness, resonated with her as a queer woman and lent itself to this kind of change. \"I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in her book to nod toward telling a queer story,\" Brownell said. \"Bridgerton\" has previously dabbled in queer relationships, but only between men. In season one, Benedict befriends an artist named Henry Granville, who's engaged in a secret relationship with another man. Granville is married and tells Benedict that he and his wife have an understanding that allows him to pursue the relationship \u2014 though only behind closed doors. More prominently, in \"Queen Charlotte,\" the king and queen's footmen, Reynolds and Brimsley, are also in a secret relationship that appears to have dissolved by the time they reach adulthood. \"Because of the world they inhabited, it was still a hangable offense to be gay, and it was just not possible,\" Hugh Sachs, who plays older Brimsley, told Vulture. The rules between men and women differed at the time: Sodomy was a capitol offense in England until 1861, per the Encyclopedia Britannica, while lesbian sex acts didn't fall under any legislation. Obviously, \"Bridgerton\" is far from historical text, but it seems unlikely that an open, romantic relationship between two women would fly even in the show's alternate history. The show won't be able to write a romance between Francesca and Michaela without actively engaging with what it means to pursue a relationship with another woman in high-society Regency London. That doesn't preclude their happiness though, according to Brownell. \"There are also some elements of her story that allow us to make sure we can tell a pretty happy ending for Francesca and Michaela,\" Brownell told Glamour. \"It was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple.\" In \"When He Was Wicked,\" Michael is forced to reluctantly assume John's title as Earl after Francesca miscarries, preventing it from passing on to one of John's sons. To make matters worse, he's also been in love with Francesca since they first met and does his best to conceal that through cultivating a rakish reputation. After John's death, he flees to India for four years, leaving Francesca to manage the Kilmartin estate. \"Bridgerton\" has gone to great pains to remind us that women cannot inherit titles, especially in season three. Inquiries from the Crown leave the Featheringtons scrambling to produce a male heir (congrats to Penelope on winning that race), and the Mondrich family inherits the Kent estate after their young son miraculously turns out to be Lady Kent's closest male relative. Michaela won't be able to inherit John's Earldom, nor presumably be able to sequester herself in India for years at a time, after his death. And as a presumably unmarried woman herself, she'll likely be facing pressure to marry, or living life as a spinster. That doesn't mean that \"Bridgerton\" can't make adjustments to clear a thoughtful path for Francesca and Michaela. In the books, Francesca decides to pursue a second marriage after John's death not out of a need for companionship, but rather because of her desire for children. In fact, she's rather secure in her position as a widow, afforded the rare freedom to live an independent life as a woman. Should she not miscarry and give birth to John's son in the show, she would retain that freedom without question of which man would assume the title. Brownell told Glamour that despite the change from Michael to Michaela, she still plans to \"honor\" the book on television. \"Obviously, some changes will have to be made to the storyline, but there are ways to honor a lot of the book,\" Brownell said. At this point, we can't be certain of how \"Bridgerton\" will manage Michaela's gender swap, and her eventual romance. But for this gentle writer, it's heartening to see \"Bridgerton\" take a big swing like this \u2014 and set up a sweeping queer love story for one of its main characters.

And it's costing them. The cost to keep homes cool between June and September could reach a 10-year high this summer, say two groups advocating for programs to help low-income residents pay their energy bills. The groups projected that the average cost across the country could be $719, a nearly 8% increase from the same period last year. In some regions that figure is higher; in Southern states like Texas, the average cost could hit $858. \"There's a price to ignoring climate change,\" said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which conducted the analysis with the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate. \"The amount of electricity people use is going to go up, and it's a reaction to extreme heat.\" The forecast comes as the Southwest swelters under a heat wave that's moving across the US this week. Federal data indicates heat waves happen six times a year on average, up from about twice a year during the 1960s. Meanwhile, climate scientists said May was the hottest month on record globally, continuing a 12-month streak where each one was warmer than the last. The culprit is the climate crisis, and burning fossil fuels for electricity is the largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions trapping heat in the atmosphere. The US still relies on natural gas and coal to produce 60% of its power. The forecast for summer cooling costs is based on federal data on regional electric prices, summer temperatures, and residential air conditioning, Wolfe said. His group's predictions are slightly higher than those by the US Energy Information Administration in June, which forecast average monthly bills of $173, or a 3% increase over last year. \"We are assuming a higher rate of temperature change, and recent heat waves are bearing this out,\" Wolfe said. \"We also assumed a slightly higher rate for electricity.\" Many factors affect electricity prices, including the costs of fuel, renewable energy, and power-grid maintenance. Wolfe said the cost projections would've been higher if natural-gas prices hadn't been falling since the global energy crisis in 2021. But he emphasized that burning more fossil fuels would worsen the already deadly and expensive heat waves causing Americans to use more energy. Wolfe argued that federal, state, and local policymakers needed stronger policies and programs to protect vulnerable people during scorching summers. Cities with typically hot summers \u2014 including Phoenix; El Paso, Texas; and St. Louis \u2014 set up public cooling centers, but that isn't enough to help people stay safe, Wolfe said. A 2020 survey from the US Energy Information Administration found that nearly 20% of families earning less than $20,000 had no air conditioning. Those who do may not turn it on in an effort to avoid higher bills, Wolfe said. Meanwhile, 33 states don't prevent utility companies from disconnecting residential power during extreme heat, putting children and older adults in particular at risk. Wolfe argued that more states and cities should adopt shutoff protections and that Congress should boost funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which covers a portion of low-income families' utility bills. He estimated that about 1 million fewer households would get financial help this year because Congress approved less funding for the program than it did for fiscal 2023. Homeowners could also install energy-efficient appliances, such as electric heat pumps, and take advantage of tax credits and rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act to make retrofits more affordable. Some states are expected to this year start doling out rebates to homeowners with low and moderate incomes. The program is designed to offer point-of-sale discounts on heat pumps, electric stoves, insulation, new breaker boxes, and wiring \u2014 capped at $14,000 per household. Landlords who rent to people in low and moderate income brackets are also eligible. New York this month became the first state to open up applications. \"We need to change the way we think about helping families during the summer and how to upgrade their homes so they can stay cool while not increasing energy use and emissions,\" Wolfe said. \"Now is the time to prepare for higher temperatures.\" Are you struggling to pay your energy bill this summer or worried about power shutoffs?

A vote in favor of the multibillion-dollar sum would put the Technoking of Tesla, as he's called by the company, one step closer to pocketing 304 million shares \u2014 compensation that a Delaware judge struck down as \"unfathomable\" earlier this year. At Tesla's stock price as of the market's close on Wednesday \u2014 and considering the exercise price of $23.34 per share \u2014 the 10-year pay package, which Musk earned in 12 tranches by hitting a series of financial goalposts since 2018, would be worth $46.8 billion, pre-tax. That's more than the GDP of dozens of countries, including Iceland and Paraguay, and the market cap of major corporations like Barclays and Kering. Furthermore, it's more than any CEO has ever made in a single pay package \u2014 both in terms of the sheer amount of money and the amount of control it would give Musk, whose stake in the company would jump from 13% to more than 20%. (The package, announced in 2018, was also rare in terms of its riskiness: The targets Tesla had to hit were deemed moonshots at the time, and if he didn't reach them, he'd make nothing.) \"There is certainly no comparable in level of pay,\" Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, told Business Insider. \"Even if you divide it by 10, it's still a ginormous amount of money.\" If shareholders vote in favor of the package, that doesn't mean Musk will automatically get that ginormous amount of money; the Delaware judge who originally decided the case or the state's Supreme Court, which would hear any appeal of the case, will make the final decision. And if the pay package does eventually get approved, it's hard to know exactly how much it will be worth when Musk, who is worth $198 billion, per Bloomberg, actually exercises the options. (Because of the lawsuit, which was filed in 2018, he hasn't pocketed any of them yet.) Musk's pay package was worth $2.3 billion when it was granted to him in 2018, though its value has sky-rocketed as the stock ballooned and the various tranches of options vested. (Its value has actually fallen this year, though, in tandem with Tesla's share price, from about $56 billion when the January judgment was made.) That said, no matter how you slice it, it's an eye-popping amount. \"When you start seeing someone making a couple hundred million \u2014 $250 million, $220 million \u2014 it seems that's when questions and media coverage starts to happen,\" Schloetzer said. \"Any way of looking at it, it's an astronomical sum.\" To put Musk's pay package into perspective, we compared it to those of other CEOs. These compensation packages typically include cash and stock options, as well as the value of any perks. Here's a look at who has come close to approaching Musk in terms of annual compensation, in order of the size of the pay package at the date granted, according to data provided by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm, which has been tracking CEO pay packages since 2007.

See our article on Business Insider for current information. With the Federal Reserve Bank holding interest rates steady, inflation worries continue to rise. And no group is feeling the pinch more than Generation X. Sixty-four percent of Gen Xers have cut back on discretionary spending like dining out and travel in the last three months, the highest percentage of any generation, according to TransUnion's consumer pulse study published on June 12. TransUnion surveyed 3,000 adults between April 29 and May 8 in partnership with third-party research firm Dynata. Overall, 84% of respondents cited inflation for everyday goods like groceries and gas as a top concern, a 5% increase from the same period in the previous year. Interest rate worries also climbed to 46%, up from 41% a year ago. This inflation concern has many Americans believing that their paychecks are not keeping up with their costs of living. Gen X \u2014 who were born between 1965 and 1980 \u2014 is struggling the most, with 56% indicating their income isn't matching the pace of rising prices, the highest for any generation. This comes at a time when many Gen Xers are already feeling financial pressure. According to a Business Insider and YouGov survey of over 1,800 US adults in July, 50% of Gen Xers do not feel financially secure even though they are at the height of their earning potential. It was also the generation least likely to feel somewhat or very financially secure. In addition to inflation pressure, Gen X is responsible for 38% of the debt in the US despite representing about 20% of the US population, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. Gen X also has a more dire view of the economy in general. While all generations listed inflation as their biggest concern regarding household finances \u2014 ranging from 77% for Gen Z respondents to 90% for baby boomers \u2014 many Gen Xers are also worried that the country is heading toward a recession. Half of this cohort named this as their second-biggest concern. What's more, 47% of Gen Xers feel optimistic about household finances in the next 12 months. That was well behind Gen Z and millennials, at 65% and 64%, respectively. Boomers were more evenly split at 49%. Additionally, more than one-third of Gen X respondents anticipate canceling subscriptions and memberships, and one in four plan to cancel or reduce digital services. As inflation concerns rise, Gen X is being hit the hardest, as they deal with high debt levels and insufficient income growth to match cost-of-living increases.  \"Consumers are facing distinct challenges when taking into account today's high inflation and interest rate environment,\" said Charlie Wise, senior vice president and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion, in the company's press release. \"As the cost of living continues to increase, we are seeing clear behavioral changes, with those being 'inflation concerned' more likely to cut back on discretionary spending and cancel subscriptions or memberships.\" Are you a Gen Xer who has needed to adjust your budget and spending habits and is willing to talk about how?

But now, many Western leaders face their own challenges.","date":"2024-06-14T14:53:13Z","content":"The G7 summit has long been a showcase of global leadership and power. The world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies \u2014 the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK \u2014 gather each year to discuss issues such as the economy, security, and trade. But 2024's group of leaders appears to be one of the weakest that has attended the summit for some time. As Politico noted, many of the attendees are distracted by domestic issues that are threatening their authority and grip on power. This year's cohort shows that there is a \"crisis of Western authority,\" according to Inderjeet Parmar, a professor of international politics at City University of London. Political instability and uncertainty are rampant, from the recent surge of support for the far-right at the EU Parliamentary elections to the controversies on both sides of the US presidential campaign. Among those facing challenges to his authority is France's president, Emmanuel Macron. He is just days away from a snap election, which many think could end his current coalition. Macron called the election after a big win for his rival Marine Le Pen's National Rally party at the European parliamentary elections. Macron's centrist alliance secured a 14.6% vote compared to the far-right National Rally's staggering 31.4%. Similarly, German chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats party recently suffered an embarrassing blow after the center-right party, Christian Democrats, rallied enough seats to sweep past the Social Democrats at the European elections. Meanwhile, in the UK, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, appears to be on course for a heavy election loss next month. Andrew Payne, a City University of London lecturer in foreign policy, told Business Insider that it would be difficult for some leaders to make \"credible commitments on trade, sanctions, or any other issue of international significance\" at this year's summit. \"When you're not sure if the person across the table is still going to be in office next month, or next year, you might think twice about striking a long-term agreement,\" Payne said. Meanwhile, the US' global reputation has suffered in recent months. Donald Trump and Hunter Biden's respective criminal convictions have undermined the country's brand, regardless of who wins the Oval Office in the upcoming election, according to Payne and Parmar. \"The USA, as the world's pivotal state, at the heart of the G7 and its liberal international order, has candidates for the White House in November who are unpopular, and one of them is a convicted felon leading what is a far-right political party that threatens to wreak vengeance on its political opponents,\" Parmar said. Payne argued that some of the G7 leaders aren't outright weak; rather, they face circumstances that threaten their authority. \"This is largely the same group of leaders that initiated or maintained an unprecedentedly strong response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, for example,\" Payne said. \"But in a democracy, leaders are only as strong as their domestic foundations allow them to be, however bold their foreign policy visions may be. And right now, the domestic foundations of most of the G7 leaders are brittle at best,\" he added. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023. Times Internet Limited.

The financial giant fired the workers last month \"after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work,\" according to filings with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority seen by Business Insider. The news was first reported by Bloomberg, which said more than a dozen employees were impacted. According to LinkedIn profiles that appear to correspond to people named in FINRA filings seen by Business Insider, several workers dismissed from Wells Fargo in May categorized their roles as either hybrid or remote. The filings, however, do not say whether the fired employees were allegedly faking work from home. A Wells Fargo spokesperson didn't immediately respond to BI's request for comment. It's unclear whether the former employees were using so-called mouse jigglers, which some workers have used to keep their chat status active and prevent their computers from going to sleep. Regardless, the firings are a reminder that businesses can face high costs when workers mail it in and of the continuing tug-of-war over where people do their jobs. Big US banks have been some of the strictest employers when it comes to calling workers back to the office. Wells Fargo states on its website that many of its corporate workers are eligible to work hybrid roles. But that flexibility has been harder to come by in finance as Wall Street firms continue to push workers to return to the office. In one survey last year, however, two-thirds of execs at US financial services companies said they'd rather quit than head into the office five days a week. While some of the return-to-office fights from a couple of years ago have cooled, there are still disagreements about the impact of workers not being in their cubicles every day. And it's not just because bosses might not trust employees when they're not within earshot of them. Some remote workers also report feeling less dialed into their 9-to-5. That feeling is also showing up in other snapshots of worker sentiment. In April, the polling firm Gallup reported that worker engagement in the US had fallen to the lowest level in more than a decade. Only about one in three full- and part-time workers reported being engaged in the first quarter of 2024, according to Gallup. More worrisome, Gallup found that 17% of workers were \"actively disengaged\" in the first three months of the year, up a point from 2023. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright \u00a9 2023.

My German partner and I have been raising a child here, and our quality of life and affordable healthcare have been especially great. However, the road to finding my own joy in this country has been a bit bumpy. In a 2023 InterNations survey of over 12,000 expats, Germany was voted one of the countries expats hate to live in the most. Although I certainly don't hate living here, I must admit it's not always perfect. Though I was born and raised in the United States, my mother is Filipina, and my father is American. Because of my mixed-Asian appearance, I've received many questions and comments I'd rather not deal with. When asked where I'm from, saying I'm American\" doesn't suffice. Almost immediately after, the follow-up question comes: \"But where are your parents from?\" This \"dance\" of questions has been a topic of national discourse, especially for Germans who are not perceived as \"German.\" Here, I don't fit into many people's image of a stereotypical American. After years of enduring this, I now just say that I'm Asian American. During these interactions, I miss the idea that anyone can be American without questioning it. In the US, I was rarely asked about my ethnic background except on official documents. The complex German language is another humbling aspect of everyday living here. Nouns have three grammatical genders, and adjective declensions are challenging. It's frustrating that a sentence can go on and on until the verb comes at the end \u2014 it's literally an exercise in hanging onto every word in a conversation. Try doing that at a party with loud music. Sadly, I'm also still stuck in my native English head, which doesn't delineate between a formal and informal \"you,\" either. It's hard to know when to use formal \"sie\" or informal \"du.\" In caf\u00e9s, most young people exchange the informal. In office environments or with older adults, it's safer to use the formal. I've bounced between both so many times with my doctors and kid's teachers that it's cringeworthy. As a non-native speaker, I usually get a free pass \u2014 if I mess up the formal and informal, it's acceptable. Just don't tell anyone how long I've lived here. Though I miss the comforts of my hometowns of Los Angeles and New York, my family and friends have made living here a bit lighter. My writing group alone has been a therapeutic salve: We've bonded over stories of cold customer-service interactions (I can barely get anyone to acknowledge my existence in a clothing store) and linguistic gaffes. More importantly, I've encountered genuineness. Friendships here run deep \u2014 asking someone, \"How are you?\" feels like a sober gesture of checking in that can lead to longer conversations. I've found strangers tend to look out for each other here, too. Thanks to Germany's central location, I've also seen some incredible corners of Europe. We're three hours by train from Amsterdam, three and a half hours by train from Paris, and four hours by train from London. Despite all the mistakes, misunderstandings, and episodes of embarrassment, I can honestly say that I'm grateful for everything living in Germany has brought me.

Rodriguez, The Associated Press","title":"California winemakers and an international nonprofit are bringing over Ukrainian peers","url":"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2024\/06\/13\/california-winemakers-ukrainian-regenerative-agriculture-demining\/","description":"\u201cWe are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm ... into this land,\u201d said Georgiy Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea region.","date":"2024-06-13T08:04:27Z","content":"As the head of an association of winemakers in southern Ukraine, Georgiy Molchanov knows a lot about how to cultivate grapes; not so much how to grow them amid undetonated mines. But that was the situation he found himself in after a Russian rocket dropped the explosives on his vineyard near the port city of Mykolaiv in August 2022, six months after Russia invaded. The damage \u2014 and danger \u2014 the mines brought to his business marked one of the myriad catastrophic effects the more than 2-year-old war has had on the eastern European country. Now, thanks to the combined efforts of the international nonprofit organization Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and the Grgich Hills Estate winery in Napa Valley, Molchanov is taking the steps he needs to reclaim and heal his wounded land. First, Roots of Peace and Rotary International provided him with the expertise and supplies he needed to safely detonate the mines. Then, the groups teamed up to bring him and five other Ukrainian winemakers to Grgich Hills in Rutherford. During a weeklong stay here, they learned about regenerative organic farming, an agricultural method that prioritizes soil health and ecosystem balance. \u201cWe are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm \u2026 into this land,\u201d said Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea region. He and his fellow entrepreneurs have another goal as well: to spread the message that, despite the ongoing war, the Ukrainian people remain resilient and look forward to life in peace. \u201cPeople in Ukraine are still alive,\u201d said Svitlana Tsybak, Owner and CEO of Beykush Winery, also located in the Mykolaiv area. \u201cYes, war is in our soul, in our life, but we need \u2026 to live our lives so, of course, we need to work.\u201d Tsybak said Russian troops are staked out about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from her vineyard but the war hasn\u2019t directly affected her operations. Her winery started exporting wine to the United States six months ago. She said she wants to learn how to expand the presence of Ukrainian wine in the U.S. market. Heidi Kuhn, a California peace activist\u00a0who founded Roots of Peace, has worked for decades to remove landmines from war-ravaged land that she later helps to convert into vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields. Rotary International, which has collaborated for years with Roots of Peace, helped plan the program for the Ukrainian winemakers and funded their travel to California. \u201cThere\u2019s an estimated 110 million landmines in 60 countries, and today Ukraine tragically has over 30% of the land riddled with landmines,\u201d said Kuhn, whose program is known as the \u201cmines to vines\u201d initiative. In 2000, Kuhn worked with the founder of Grgich Hills Estate, the late Croatian immigrant Miljenko \u201cMike\u201d Grgich, and other vintners to raise funds to clear landmines in Vukovar in eastern Croatia. The town, located in a winemaking region on the banks of the Danube, was reduced to rubble during the 1991-95 war in the former Yugoslavia. Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich\u2019s nephew, a native Croatian and a winemaker at Grgich Hills Estate, said he feels deeply for Ukrainians because he understands how heart-wrenching it is to live through war. He said the family winery has for decades helped Roots of Peace. \u201cThis is just the beginning of a hopeful relationship to literally restore the health of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that not only they see how farming can be conducted without harmful chemicals, but also that they\u2019re inspired and that their hope is elevated.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Michael is also the author of Accountable: The Rise of Citizen Capitalism (HarperCollins 2020). This spring, ExxonMobil chief Darren Woods came under fire after telling Fortune Magazine that consumers\u2014not ExxonMobil\u2014were the ones holding back the transition to clean energy. \u201cWe have opportunities to make fuels with lower carbon in it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut people aren\u2019t willing to spend the money to do that.\u201d The SEC\u2019s new rules on climate disclosures similarly put emissions on consumers\u2019 shoulders: though public companies must now report their emissions, they don\u2019t have to include the emissions that come from consumers using their products. Instead, those emissions implicitly remain part of the consumer\u2019s carbon footprint. Many in the climate community bristle at blaming consumers. After all, even the concept of a consumer\u2019s \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d was only popularized by a BP-funded ad campaign in the early 2000s. But Darren Woods is right in principle: It doesn\u2019t matter what sustainable products companies create if consumers don\u2019t buy them. We shouldn\u2019t blame consumers for companies\u2019 actions, but we should focus on what they actually want to buy. Within the climate movement, we\u2019ve too often taken an \u201cif we build it, they will come\u201d approach to climate investing, assuming that if we can just develop the technology, then climate-conscious consumers will be eager to adopt it. Consider transportation and food, which together make up roughly half of a consumer\u2019s total emissions in many countries. Within each, we\u2019ve developed technologies that offer substantial reductions, but we\u2019re now seeing just how fickle consumer adoption can be. According to the Department of Energy\u2019s latest analysis, the cradle-to-grave emissions for today\u2019s electric vehicles are 48% lower than comparable gas vehicles. However, electric vehicles only made up 7.6% of automotive sales in the U.S. last year, up from 5.9% the previous year but still a long way from the two-thirds share some project for 2030. Within our food system, independent assessments of alternative proteins suggest emissions savings of up to 90% compared with beef, similar in scale to the savings from adopting a vegan diet. But at just 2% market share, alternative proteins have yet to break into the mainstream. Overall, consumption accounts for 72% of greenhouse gas emissions, just above consumer\u2019s 68% share of U.S. gross domestic product. To limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, we need to cut per capita emissions by 50% within the decade. But whatever emissions savings these and other climate technologies boast will only come to fruition if consumers love them enough to pull out their wallets. At the impact fund we lead, we\u2019ve seen that despite the many studies citing how much consumers\u2014especially younger consumers\u2014care about shopping more sustainably, the reality is more complicated. For any category, consumers tend to have a set of criteria they care most about, like price, quality, or convenience. Eighty percent of consumers now say it\u2019s important for brands to be sustainable, but sustainability is almost never among their most important criteria. If forced to make a trade-off between sustainability and those other factors, support for the sustainable option can collapse by 70% or more. Indeed, one way to tell the story of the stalling growth of plant-based meat is that as close as it\u2019s gotten to mimicking meat, it still fails to outperform on consumers\u2019 most important criteria of taste and nutrition. Many consumers marvel at these almost-meat alternatives, but not enough prefer them. The only way to drive long-term adoption of a sustainable product is by flipping the trade-off, and finding ways to make its sustainability a positive driver of the other criteria that consumers care about. Ironically, only when consumers prefer the sustainable product for reasons unrelated to sustainability will it achieve mainstream success. For example, far more consumers will say they buy a dairy alternative because it\u2019s healthier and tastes better than because of any desire to help the environment, something organic produce has long benefited from. Electric heat pumps, which now make up a majority of new heating system sales in the U.S., save money for the average consumer. More Gen Z consumers say they shop sustainable brands because of quality or value rather than concern about the climate. As with any consumer market, segments of consumers may weigh factors differently. For decades, cars sold in Europe have had roughly 50% better fuel economy on average than those sold in the United States. That\u2019s not because of unique European technology. That\u2019s because of historical consumer preferences supported by tighter regulations. Similar patterns are playing out again with electric vehicles, as penetration in Europe is double that in the U.S. Though much of the conversation about climate companies focuses on the cutting edge of the technology landscape, innovation in business models can also be highly impactful. Resale, rentals, refillable products, and reusable packaging all require very little novel technology but can still outperform on consumers\u2019 key purchasing criteria. Secondhand apparel has grown far faster than apparel at large, for example, mostly because it satisfies consumers\u2019 desire to save money. The lesson is simple: The consumer is still king. If we hope to make significant progress towards a world with net zero emissions, we need to build products they want to buy more than the traditional alternatives. And that matters far more than on whose environmental balance sheet we decide to measure those emissions. We can\u2019t blame consumers for climate change until we give them better options.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and his top deputies this week unveiled a landmark arrangement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone, iPad and Mac, they were mum on the financial terms. Left unanswered on Monday: which company is paying the other as part of a tight collaboration that has potentially lasting monetary benefits for both. But, according to people briefed on the matter, the partnership isn\u2019t expected to generate meaningful revenue for either party \u2014 at least at the outset. The arrangement includes weaving ChatGPT, a digital assistant that responds in plain terms to information requests, into Apple\u2019s Siri and new writing tools. Apple isn\u2019t paying OpenAI as part of the partnership, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deal terms are private. Instead, Apple believes pushing OpenAI\u2019s brand and technology to hundreds of millions of its devices is of equal or greater value than monetary payments, these people said. Meanwhile, Apple, thanks to OpenAI, gets the benefit of offering an advanced chatbot to consumers \u2014 potentially enticing users to spend more time on devices or even splash out on upgrades. Representatives of Apple and OpenAI declined to comment. The pact with OpenAI is part of a broader push by Apple into AI. The iPhone maker laid out the plans during a keynote address at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, showing off AI features for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. The non-ChatGPT capabilities \u2014 branded as Apple Intelligence \u2014 were designed by the company in-house.\u00a0 But even if money wasn\u2019t a major factor in the Apple-OpenAI deal, remuneration could come into play later.\u00a0 Under the current structure, the partnership could become costly for OpenAI, which needs to pay Microsoft Corp. to host ChatGPT on that company\u2019s Azure cloud-computing systems. The more people use ChatGPT, the more OpenAI\u2019s expenses rise. And the integration into Apple devices \u2014 while optional for users and limited to the company\u2019s recent products \u2014 threatens to add significantly to the computing budget. ChatGPT will be offered for free on Apple\u2019s products, but OpenAI and Apple could still make money by converting free users to paid accounts. OpenAI\u2019s subscription plans start at $20 a month \u2014 a fee that covers extra features like the ability to analyze data and generate more types of images.\u00a0 Today, if a user subscribes to OpenAI on an Apple device via the ChatGPT app, the process uses Apple\u2019s payment platform, which traditionally gives the iPhone maker a cut. Apple\u2019s deal with OpenAI isn\u2019t exclusive, and the iPhone maker is\u00a0already discussing offering\u00a0Google\u2019s Gemini chatbot as an additional option. That agreement should be in place later this year. Apple has also held talks with Anthropic as a potential chatbot partner, people familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0Bloomberg earlier this year. The idea is to ultimately offer a range of AI services to users \u2014 similar to the way Apple has different search engine options in its Safari browser. Eventually, Apple aims to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing agreements whereby it gets a cut from AI partners that monetize results in chatbots on Apple platforms, according to the people. The company believes that AI could chip away at the billions of dollars it gets from its Google search deal because users will favor chatbots and other tools over search engines. Apple will need to craft new arrangements that make up for the shortfall. Apple\u2019s own AI services won\u2019t be as costly to deliver because most of them are handled on the devices themselves, rather than through cloud computing. Still, the company is ramping up its data center operations to support new online AI services that handle more advanced tasks. To\u00a0make Apple Intelligence a success, the company will need to expand it to other languages and countries. That may be a challenge in China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest overseas markets, where services like ChatGPT and Gemini are barred.\u00a0 The company has yet to reach a deal with a local Chinese provider to handle chatbot features, but has been considering an arrangement with companies such as Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., according to the people. For now, Apple Intelligence is only available in American English, but the company is aiming to support more languages next year. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

We look into the lives, minds and agendas of CEOs at the world\u2019s most iconic companies. Jesper Brodin is the CEO of Sweden\u2019s most famous furniture company. Since he took over the yellow giant\u2019s global retail operations in 2017, the company underwent a drastic transformation. INGKA Group (the official name of IKEA\u2019s retail arm) under his tenure became a net producer of green energy; opened second-hand shops and recycling programs in most of its locations; and in some key markets, like Germany, now sells more veggie meatballs than real ones.\u00a0 Behind this strategic and operational shift is a man who deeply contemplates the role he and his company play in the world. Yes, Brodin thinks about IKEA\u2019s growth and profitability, and the company\u2019s 20% growth in recent years attest to that commitment. But he\u2019d feel bad if that was his only legacy, he says, when the world he grew up in is at risk of disappearing, both because the middle class is under pressure, and climate change is already wreaking havoc in many parts of the world.\u00a0 69 We couldn\u2019t think of a better candidate to open our new \u201cCEO Agenda\u201d series, where we explore what goes on in the lives and minds of some of the world\u2019s most influential and admired business leaders. Today we meet with the CEO of Ingka Group, Jesper Brodin. This interview has been edited for brevity.   Fortune: What is the single most important project you are working on with your company? Jesper Brodin: The single most important one is how we can better serve people with thin wallets \u2013 by becoming more affordable. At the same time, growing our business and reducing carbon in line with the Paris Agreement. We know being a good business is good for business, and we want to inspire many more to follow. Which long-term trend are you most bullish about for society and the economy at large? Climate change. We are in the most important decade of climate action, and it\u2019s our generation\u2019s responsibility to solve and change the course of the present trend. We still have it in our hands, and even if we can see slight positive movement, we need to speed up and collaborate across society, businesses and governments. If you were an economic policymaker, what would be your top priority?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To ensure that we incentivize the right investments when it comes to transitioning to net-zero. \u201cWe are in the most important decade of climate action, and it\u2019s our generation\u2019s responsibility to solve and change the course of the present trend.\u201d  What time do you get up, and what part of your morning routine sets you up for the day? Coffee is important\u2026.\u00a0 Even after 7 hours of good sleep! What time do you work until? Do you continue sending emails during the night and\/or weekends? I try to stop around 6 pm. After work, I enjoy spending time with my family and exercising. This isn\u2019t always the case \u2013 but I try. My job never ends, and I could work until midnight and still not be done. What apps or methods do you use to be more productive? Best method: spend time with family, nature, and exercise. And laugh often! Who is on your \u201cpersonal board\u201d? My wife and my three teenage kids. Thanks to them, I get a reality check on what\u2019s important in life. I also have a close relationship with our chair; Lars-Johan Jarnheimer, who has been and continues to be a great support in challenging times, with his simple and pragmatic approach.  What book have you read, either recently or in the past, that has inspired you? I recently read \u201cThe Hydrogen Revolution\u201d by Marco Alvera.\u00a0I enjoy a good old Steinbeck or Dostojevski, however, this was one of the most educational reads in a long time. If you could ask your idol one question, who would it be, and what would you ask? I have many idols\u2026. I would ask my Youth Council what more we can do to spread hope and stimulate actions for a better world. I would also ask Douglas Adams if the answer to the meaning of life and everything is still 42. As a consumer, what is your favorite company and why? Assuming I cannot vote for IKEA, I will go for Volvo Cars. They make great vehicles and have committed to transforming to 100% electric by 2030, despite the challenges. That\u2019s leadership, in my opinion. And to end on a lighter note: What was the last costume you wore? A tux, if that counts. I felt a bit dressed up since that\u2019s not my usual attire.

On Wednesday, the European Commission said it will impose duties of up to 38.1% on Chinese-made EVs, starting next month. The response in Chinese state media was fierce. One commentary piece from Xinhua, China\u2019s state media agency, called the decision \u201cmisguided\u201d and a \u201cthinly veiled excuse for protectionism.\u201d Another published Xinhua piece noted that the EU\u2019s \u201cbest-laid plan for [an] economic boom\u201d is to partner with China. An opinion piece in the Global Times, a state-owned English-language media outlet, claimed that Europe had \u201cchosen to surrender to protectionism.\u201d Chinese officials also made their displeasure known. Officials at the commerce ministry said the EU\u2019s tariffs were \u201ccounter to the spirit of cooperation.\u201d Chinese EV makers largely did not publicly criticize the EU\u2019s decision in the wake of the announcement. Chinese EV company Nio said it opposed the EU\u2019s decision but remained committed to the European EV market. Other Chinese brands, like BYD and Chery, have announced plans to build cars in Europe, which would not be subject to the tariffs. Previously, Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD pushed back against claims that their success was the result of state support, instead crediting fierce competition at home and internal efficiency. Shares of major Chinese EV makers and startups appeared to be unaffected by the ruling. Shares in BYD rose almost 6% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday; the Chinese EV giant is subject to a lower EU tariff rate than several of its Chinese peers. Nio shares rose 2%, while SAIC Motor\u2014subject to the highest tariffs\u2014dropped 1.5%. Only tariffs exceeding 50% would make the European market unattractive to Chinese EV makers, research firm Rhodium claimed in a report in late April. The tariffs do not enjoy unanimous support in Europe. The German Association of the Automotive Industry said the potential damage caused may be greater than the benefits. Major German car brands are still big players in the Chinese market and could potentially be at risk of retaliatory tariffs. China accounted for about a third of sales from BMW, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz in the first quarter of 2024. Other European goods, like luxury items, wine, and agricultural products, could also be threatened by Chinese retaliation. In January, Beijing launched an antidumping probe into French brandy, months after the EU\u2019s anti-subsidy probe into EVs, which analysts described as a possible \u201cfirst bullet\u201d in a Europe-China trade war. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The Senate moved to ensure that political reality as lawmakers approved two new members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and set up a vote on a third new panelist as soon as Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said confirmation of the three nominees would allow FERC to \u201ckeep its quorum and continue its mission of providing Americans with affordable, reliable, safe energy.\u201d The five-member commission oversees natural gas pipelines and other energy infrastructure, including transmission of electricity across state lines. The panel approved a long-awaited rule last month\u00a0making it easier to transmit renewable energy such as wind and solar power to the electric grid\u00a0\u2014 a key part of Biden\u2019s goal to\u00a0eliminate greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050.\u00a0The rule is aimed at boosting the nation\u2019s aging power grid to meet surging demand fueled by huge data centers, electrification of vehicles and buildings, artificial intelligence and other uses. Earlier this week, the agency\u00a0approved a request by the nearly $8 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline\u00a0to begin sending natural gas across rugged mountainsides in West Virginia and Virginia, despite longstanding objections from environmental groups, landowners and some elected officials. On Wednesday, the Senate approved the nominations of Democrat David Rosner and Republican Lindsay See for three and four-year terms, respectively, on the commission. Senators also limited debate on Democrat Judy Chang\u2019s nomination to a five-year term. A final vote on Chang\u2019s nomination to replace Democrat Allison Clements could occur as soon as Thursday. If approved as expected, the vote would give Democrats a working majority on the commission until at least June 2026, when the term of Democratic Chairman Willie Phillips is set to expire. \u201cA fully seated, bipartisan FERC provides more opportunity for advancing long-lasting, sensible energy infrastructure policy,\u201d said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat-turned-independent who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \u201cWhen it comes to fairly assessing all interests, five heads are better than one,\u201d Manchin said Wednesday. \u201cBringing together five different people, with five different life experiences and perspectives, helps ensure that all affected interests will be heard and fairly considered and assessed\u201d by the energy commission. Rosner, See and Chang \u201care very different people, from very different backgrounds,\u201d said Manchin, who supported all three nominees. \u201cWhat matters most is their willingness to work with one another, to consider and assess fairly different interests and points of view, and to put partisan passions aside in favor of the public interest.\u201d Rosner, a former FERC staffer, has spent the past two years on Manchin\u2019s Democratic staff on the energy committee. See, who serves as solicitor general for the state of West Virginia, argued the state\u2019s case challenging a major\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule on power plant pollution\u00a0before the Supreme Court. Chang, of Massachusetts, is a former undersecretary of energy and climate solutions for the state government. Manchin said he knows Rosner well: \u201cI have seen firsthand his expert knowledge on energy issues, his fairness, his nonpartisan approach to every problem we\u2019ve had, and his ability to work with both sides on these issues, and he\u2019s done that tremendously.\u201d Manchin, a political moderate who plays a crucial role on energy issues, called See \u201ca very capable and experienced lawyer\u201d who is \u201cwell-qualified to serve on the commission.\u201d Chang, who now teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, led energy policy under Republican Gov.

The restrictions were due to expire at the end of this month, but authorities have recently signaled that the deadline will be extended until a system to detect improper trades is ready.\u00a0 In an earlier Thursday statement, the government said it will increase financial penalties and jail terms up to life imprisonment for illicit activities. Same terms on repayment and margin requirements will be applied for retail and institutional investors to create a level playing field, it said. \u00a0 \u00a0 While retail investors have welcomed the short-selling ban, the move has been controversial within the financial community as the strategy is widely used by money managers in other markets. MSCI Inc. said in its annual market accessibility review that the country\u2019s short-selling accessibility is \u201cdeteriorating.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s better late than never,\u201d said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global Ptd. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that the resumption of short selling would increase liquidity in South Korea and lower volatility.\u201d Nonetheless, the moves showed that \u201cregulations in South Korea, like China, could change overnight and tarnished the image of the nation,\u201d he added.\u00a0 South Korea\u2019s equity benchmark Kospi Index closed 1% higher on Thursday, trimming gains of as much as 1.8%. \u00a0 Authorities are planning penalties of up to six times the profit from illegal short selling, up from five times now, the statement said. Those whose profit from such trading misdeeds is at least 5 billion won ($3.6 million) can face up to life in prison, a change from a maximum 30-year jail term previously.\u00a0 The government will also adopt a repayment period of 90 days for both retail and institutional investors, which can be extended up to twelve months. Those who engage in illegal short selling will be restricted from serving as executives at listed companies and financial firms in Korea. Stricter rules will also be applied in disclosing short positions. The changes would need parliamentary approval. \u00a0 Shortly after the trade was banned, South Korea launched an investigation into global banks to scrutinize their past transactions of short selling. Investigators have so far\u00a0found\u00a0$156 million worth of illegal short trades by nine global investment banks, most of which were procedural rule violations. \u00a0  \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

You\u2019re in the minority. Over the last six months, videos of jacket potatoes\u00a0with no-nonsense toppings like tuna mayonnaise\u00a0or baked beans\u2014a staple of UK home-cooking that Americans will recognize as an alternate universe version of a loaded baked potato\u2014have racked up hundreds of millions of views.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0even brought people from halfway around the world to the center of England to sample this culinary craze. (Americans that have become familiar\u00a0with TikTok\u2019s tuna salad stuffed\u00a0jacket potatoes\u00a0are not generally sold on the subject.)\u00a0 Ben Newman, aka \u201cSpudman,\u201d has a hard time explaining the phenomenon. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re good, but we are just a humble spud van,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u00a0An\u00a0average Spudman TikTok video\u00a0that shows him stuffing a mundane baked potato in his food truck routinely get\u00a030\u00a0million views, sometimes more than 100 million. And the hearty food trend has showed no signs of slowing, even with the arrival of summer.\u00a0 Before going viral, Newman would\u00a0sell\u00a0around 300 jacket potatoes a day from his van in Tamworth, Staffordshire, a business he\u2019s had for\u00a022 years.\u00a0\u00a0In 2020 he started posting videos on TikTok to keep customers coming during the pandemic. By the middle of 2023, around 350,000 followers\u2014a mix of Brits who liked the\u00a0familiarity and international viewers\u00a0intrigued by typical British fare\u2014were\u00a0watching\u00a0him bake potatoes and chat with customers. After\u00a0a random 2023 video of a jacket potato\u00a0attracted around half a million views, his following skyrocketed to a current tally of around 3.5 million.\u00a0 Those followers have sparked demand: Business has jumped around 400%\u00a0since Newman began making TikTok videos, and he\u00a0now sells\u00a0up to 1,500 potatoes a day to\u00a0customers who sometimes queue\u00a0for hours. With potatoes starting at \u00a34 ($5) for options such as cheese and beans, he\u2019s taking in several thousand pounds a day. (Newman won\u2019t confirm his sales figures.) So far, Newman hasn\u2019t been hit by a shortage of potatoes, but he\u2019s not ruling it out. \u201cWe source our potatoes locally to keep food miles down,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m worried the potato farmer won\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d Spudman customers even\u00a0have an impact on Tamworth\u2019s shops and cafes, as they\u00a0fortify themselves with cups of coffee and bottles of water before heading to the van. \u201cThe knock-on effect for the whole town has been great too,\u201d says Newman. \u201cLots of local businesses\u00a0come to me and say they\u2019ve had the best January and February they\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Customers are driving for hours,\u00a0even getting on flights. \u201cOne guy flew to Gatwick from the Philippines, hired a car, drove up to meet us and eat a potato, stayed overnight in a hotel and then flew back,\u201d relates Newman. \u201cOne of our customers last week was from Wyoming.\u201d But recently, the local jacket potato scene has been\u00a0rocked by the arrival of the Spud Bros, who\u2019ve launched a jacket potato van in Preston, Lancashire, a two-hour drive away. Its\u00a01.7\u00a0million TikTok followers\u00a0are treated to videos of brothers Jacob and Harley Nelson baking potatoes with traditional toppings, along with the Lancashire specialty, parched peas.\u00a0 The Spud Bros\u00a0appearance has led to clashes between fans of the two accounts. Spudman says he doesn\u2019t mind the new jacket potato stars.\u00a0\u201cImitation is the finest form of flattery,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like Ronaldo\/Messi,\u201d\u00a0said Harley Nelson\u00a0on a podcast. \u201cWe respect each other, but we need that rivalry.\u201d Danny Malin, host\u00a0of the YouTube channel\u00a0Rate My Takeaway,\u00a0labels the rivalry\u00a0\u201cjacket potato wars.\u201d\u00a0 While he ever so slightly prefers Spud Bros, he says both are notable. He prefers Spudman\u2019s homemade chicken curry and coleslaw, but likes\u00a0the Spud Bros\u2019 flavored butters.\u00a0Still, customers are \u201cnot going for the potato, they\u2019re going to meet Spudman, and to go on their feed and to put it on their TikTok,\u201d Malin says. \u201cIt\u2019s for their claim to fame.\u201d Unsurprisingly, other vendors are jumping in. Lauren Jones is the\u00a0operator of the\u00a0Baked Potato Company by Tatie Lady. Last autumn\u00a0she debuted her\u00a0van in Barnsley, West Yorkshire. On opening day, the wait was two hours. After Spudman offered a day of\u00a0free jacket potatoes in January, business got even more intense for Jones.\u00a0\u201cEveryone got an obsession with jacket potatoes,\u201d she says, which led to increased demand at\u00a0her own van. She now sells around 400 potatoes a day. \u201cI think people like it, because it\u2019s traditional,\u201d Jones\u00a0says, in an effort to explain the phenomenon. Plus,\u00a0for under \u00a35, you can get a meal that\u2019s cheaper than\u00a0fast food options \u2014 her potatoes start at \u00a33, while the price of a fish and\u00a0chips order is\u00a0now\u00a0routinely in the double digits.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a proper British staple food and comfort food,\u00a0but it\u2019s not unhealthy either,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I go on holiday and come home, the first thing I want is a jacket.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Mosseri has enjoyed a rapid rise at the social media giant since since joining Facebook in 2008, and although the pair clearly get on now, the product designer turned head of Instagram revealed that their relationship wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing. \u201cWe argued a lot in the early years,\u201d Mosseri said. \u201cI remember pushing back a lot on a number of random unimportant design specifics. \u201cHe was very results-focused and I cared about things I still care about now, but I didn\u2019t care enough about other things. He was pushing me hard on the things I didn\u2019t care about enough that I should have cared about.\u201d Looking back at his \u201c26-year-old hotheaded self,\u201d he added that defying what\u2019s important to your boss is \u201cprobably not good career advice.\u201d But now, Mosseri insisted that he has learned how to better balance what he holds dear at work with whatever\u2019s at the top of Zuckerberg\u2019s priority list.\u00a0 \u201cMark is very consistent,\u201d Mosseri said on the podcast The Colin and Samir Show. \u201cHe is always going to hold a really, really high bar. He\u2019s always going to push you really, really hard. He\u2019s always going to have very high expectations. \u201cYou can, when you\u2019ve worked with anybody for long enough, start to anticipate what their feedback\u2019s going to be, what they care about.\u00a0 \u201cSo as long as you make sure you embrace that in addition to embracing whatever you believe in and how you want to approach the role, you have to find that balance. \u201cWith Mark, I have that balance most of the time.\u201d Before joining the tech world, Mosseri had the far less glamorous experience of washing dishes and waiting tables.\u00a0 He graduated from New York University in 2005 and worked as a product designer and UI engineer for the now defunct company TokBox for two years before getting his big break at Facebook. In the 16 years since, he\u2019s scaled the company\u2019s ranks from the bottom to the top, and he credits being a jack of all trades and \u201creliable\u201d for his success. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good, I just had a lot of range,\u201d Mosseri said. \u201cI\u2019m decent at a strangely large number of things\u2014and I think that has really helped me.\u201d He was made head of Instagram following the resignation of the app\u2019s founders in 2018, six years after Zuckerberg bought it for $1 billion, and has been unofficially placed in charge of Meta\u2019s new darling, Threads.\u00a0 On his transition from product design to management, he continued: \u201cBeing more of a generalist is more advantageous. \u201cBeing an executive is a very generalist type of role, so my career really accelerated when I leaned into that and was honest about what I wasn\u2019t good at.\u201d Fortune reached Meta for comment. Meta\u2019s CTO, Andrew \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth, similarly worked his way up the ranks.\u00a0 Having started out as one of Facebook\u2019s first engineers before being plucked out for promotion after promotion, Bosworth said the difference between him and his peers wasn\u2019t simply who could work the hardest.\u00a0 In an interview on Lenny\u2019s Podcast, Bosworth revealed that he worked 120 hours a week and didn\u2019t sleep more than four hours consecutively a day for two years. \u201cThere are other people who do the exact same thing, maybe they worked harder, maybe they were smarter, maybe they did better,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t play out for them and it\u2019s a big sacrifice.\u201d Instead, like Mosseri, he credits his success with putting himself forward for projects that are important to his boss and a result ending up under the \u201cEye of Sauron\u201d\u2014otherwise known as Zuckerberg\u2019s beady watch.\u00a0 \u201cIf it\u2019s the most important thing, you\u2019re going to get a smaller piece. Everyone wants to be there,\u201d Bosworth advised. \u201cGet the piece that you can crush, kill, do a great job at, and grow from.\u201d The Facebook veteran also recommended volunteering to help out in an area that the company isn\u2019t paying a lot of attention to, but is still really important to the business. \u201cAs an executive, when there\u2019s a huge dam holding up the floodwaters, you respect the heck out of that person who is holding that dam up.\u201d Subscribe to the Fortune Next to Lead newsletter to get weekly strategies on how to make it to the corner office.

The Minnesota Department of Education \u201cfailed to act on warning signs known to the department prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the start of the alleged fraud, did not effectively exercise its authority to hold Feeding Our Future accountable to program requirements, and was ill-prepared to respond to the issues it encountered with Feeding Our Future,\u201d the nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Auditor concluded. Seventy people have been charged in federal court for their alleged roles in a scheme prosecutors say centered on a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. Five of the first seven defendants to stand trial\u00a0were convicted Friday.\u00a0The trial gained widespread attention after\u00a0someone tried to bribe a juror\u00a0with a bag of $120,000 in cash the night before the case went to the jury. Authorities are still trying to determine the source of that money. Eighteen other defendants have already pleaded guilty. Trials are still pending for the others. Education Commissioner Willie L. Jett II disputed the auditor\u2019s characterization of his agency\u2019s oversight as inadequate. He said in a written response in the\u00a0120-page report\u00a0that its oversight \u201cmet applicable standards\u201d and that department officials \u201cmade effective referrals to law enforcement.\u201d He said department staffers first spotted problems in summer 2020 and raised their concerns with federal authorities. \u201cWhat happened with Feeding Our Future was a travesty \u2014 a coordinated, brazen abuse of nutrition programs that exist to ensure access to healthy meals for low-income children,\u201d the commissioner wrote. \u201cThe responsibility for this flagrant fraud lies with the indicted and convicted fraudsters.\u201d But Republican legislative leaders said at a news conference that the report shows that the failure to stop the fraud lies with the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, which has said that the state\u2019s\u00a0hands were tied by a 2021 court order\u00a0to resume payments despite its concerns \u2014 a charge the judge disputed \u2014 and that the FBI asked the state to continue making payments while the investigation continued. \u201cThis is stunning,\u201d said GOP Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks. \u201cThe Department of Education and Gov. Walz have repeatedly tried to tell the public that they did all they could \u2026 but this report clearly demonstrates that was a false narrative.\u201d Sharp criticism also came from some Democrats during a hearing on the report. Sen. Ann Rest, of New Hope, said it was unfortunate that Jett\u2019s predecessors, who ran the agency during the time in question, were not there to answer questions. \u201cThose commissioners had the authority, as was pointed out in this report by the legislative auditor, and they clearly did not exercise it to discover and to report fraud,\u201d Rest said. \u201cWe do not hear of \u2026 similar programs using federal money to feed students in other states that experienced such fraud.\u201d Rest lamented that nobody in the department has taken responsibility for what happened. In a variant on the expression, \u201cThe buck stops here,\u201d Rest said: \u201cBut what we really do have is the buck is still running down the street \u2014 running down the street and stopping nowhere. And that is unacceptable.\u201d Republican Rep. Patti Anderson, of Dellwood, who served as state auditor from 2003-07, said the disruption of the pandemic was no excuse. \u201cThey could have stopped this long before there were 250 plus million dollars in fraudulent claims sent out to these folks,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAll this could have all been avoided.\u201d Jett, who was appointed commissioner in January 2023 amid the fallout, said his agency has implemented changes to strengthen its oversight capabilities, including establishing an office of inspector general in 2023, adding a general counsel\u2019s office in 2022, providing training to all staff on its updated fraud-reporting policies, and contracting with a firm to conduct financial reviews of certain partners. Federal prosecutors say the conspiracy\u00a0exploited rules that were kept lax\u00a0so the economy wouldn\u2019t crash during the pandemic. The FBI began digging into it in spring 2021. The defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in\u00a0passport fraud\u00a0and accepted kickbacks. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, and only about $50 million of it has been recovered, authorities say. The money came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state agency, which funneled the funds through partners including Feeding Our Future. The defendants awaiting trial include\u00a0Aimee Bock, the founder\u00a0of the group. She has maintained her innocence. An\u00a0Associated Press analysis published last June\u00a0documented how thieves across the country\u00a0plundered billions\u00a0in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. Fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion, while an additional $123 billion was wasted or misspent. The combined loss represented 10% of the $4.3 trillion the government disbursed by last fall. Nearly 3,200 people have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen aid has been seized, according to the Justice Department. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The announcement from the White House on Thursday came after Gruenberg\u2019s tenure became\u00a0marred by allegations of workplace abuse\u00a0that led to him to resign. A longtime financial regulator, Goldsmith Romero is currently a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the nation\u2019s financial derivatives regulator. She previously worked with the Department of Treasury and was part of the team that handled the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which lent $700 billion to troubled banks during the 2008 financial crisis. She also is a law professor at Georgetown University. Her previous nominations to the nation\u2019s financial regulators were unanimously confirmed by the Senate. \u201cShe has proven herself to be a strong, independent, and fair regulator who is not afraid to do what\u2019s right,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio and chair of the Senate Banking Committee, in a statement. Gruenberg last month said he would resign from the FDIC, after an independent report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton found incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees. Complaints included a woman who said she was stalked by a coworker and continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field office supervisor referring to gay men as \u201clittle girls;\u201d and a female field examiner who described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior examiner\u2019s private parts. Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg to step down since the allegations emerged late last year. The White House and Gruenberg resisted those calls partly because the FDIC is led by a five member board, and his resignation would pass control of the agency to the FDIC\u2019s vice chair, who is a Republican. Gruenberg\u2019s resignation would not be official until Goldsmith Romero nomination is finalized. \u201cFDIC employees deserve a safe workplace that allows them to focus on their important mission to safeguard our country\u2019s financial security. Unfortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Gruenberg, that hasn\u2019t been the case,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, in a statement. The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation\u2019s deposit insurance program, which insures Americans\u2019 deposits up to $250,000 in case their bank fails. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The MOEX Russia Index opened down as much as 4% in Moscow on Thursday.\u00a0 The move has sown confusion among markets over the fallout from the sanctions. The changes are likely to lead to increased costs for market participants due to higher commissions and wider bid-ask spreads as well as unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations.\u00a0 Any settlement with a foreign counterpart and foreign trade operations may be negatively affected, and the restrictions could also have an impact on yuan trading, which now accounts for more than half of foreign currency exchange.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s authorities have sought to move away from the dollar and euro, branding them \u201ctoxic\u201d amid sanctions over President Vladimir Putin\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The share of the yuan in trading has increased, while officials have pursued measures to\u00a0discourage\u00a0businesses and people from using the currencies of nations that have imposed restrictions.\u00a0 \u201cTransactions in dollar and euros for individuals have already been significantly limited for quite some time,\u201d said Sofya Donets, an economist at Tinkoff Investments. \u201cFor the average Russian, nothing much will change.\u201d \u201cWhat will not change is the continued strengthening of the yuan\u2019s position in Russia,\u201d Donets said. Despite some concerns that settlements involving China\u2019s currency may be affected, the sanctions weren\u2019t designed to limit its use, she said. Transactions with the dollar and euro will still be available on the over-the-counter market, the Bank of Russia said in a statement. The regulator said it will use bank and OTC data to set the ruble\u2019s exchange rates to those currencies.\u00a0 The central bank also\u00a0delayed the start\u00a0of trading Thursday on the foreign exchange and precious metals markets to 9:50 a.m. Moscow time from 6:50 a.m. \u201cEscalation of sanctions will destabilize the currency market and shift flows towards private non-sanctioned banks. The next step of escalation can be secondary sanctions on foreign banks that help with settlements.\u201d Alexander Isakov, Russia economist.\u00a0 Daily trading in the dollar started in Russia more than three decades ago. The share of currencies Russia has labeled as toxic, which include the greenback and euro, fell to 45.9% in exchange-based foreign currency trading in May, while the yuan\u2019s share rose to a record of 53.6%, according to the Bank of Russia\u2019s\u00a0data.\u00a0 \u201cCompanies and individuals can continue to buy and sell the US dollar and euro through Russian banks,\u201d the central bank said, adding that all funds in those currencies in accounts and deposits \u201cwill remain safe.\u201d\u00a0 Russia\u2019s shift away from western currencies since sanctions were first imposed over the 2014 annexation of Crimea may limit the disruption from the US penalties.\u00a0 \u201cOverall, there is a sense that the main costs are related to lack of information about exchange rates and flows, but not to the shortage of currency,\u201d said Evgeny Koshelev, an analyst at Rosbank. \u201cThe cost of alternative conversion channels for exporters are relatively fixed, albeit not small. For importers, they could increase at first, then a return to the previous level is possible.\u201d The Bank of Russia has been preparing for the possibility that the country\u2019s only foreign-exchange clearing house falls under sanctions since last year. To avoid a collapse in settlements, the regulator had\u00a0developed\u00a0additional mechanisms for determining official exchange rates in the absence of data from the Moscow Exchange. \u201cThe biggest effect is the effect on the Moscow Exchange itself,\u201d Donets said. \u201cEven then, it\u2019s not critical.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Suddenly, pop music swells and round black and white objects the size of soccer balls begin to fly toward me at an accelerated clip, exploding into confetti each time I punch one away.\u00a0 No, I\u2019m not dreaming\u2014just working out in my living room while wearing a VR headset, playing the Supernatural fitness game, immersed in a 360-degree wonderland. When it\u2019s over, I\u2019m panting, elated, and totally sweaty, just like when I finish taking a class at the gym\u2014and the next day my lats are on fire.\u00a0 So I\u2019m not surprised to read the findings of a small new study which found that VR exercise\u2014specifically the Supernatural app on a Meta Quest headset\u2014was just as effective as comparable real-life, \u201chigh-quality cardiovascular activity\u201d like running, boxing, and swimming.\u00a0 The study, out of the Behavioral Medicine Lab at the University of Victoria, Canada, and published on June 6 in the journal JMIR Serious Games, looked at the effect of two medium-intensity modes of the games \u201cFlow\u201d and \u201cBoxing\u201d on 24 participants with little or no VR experience. It measured results with what\u2019s called a Metabolic Equivalent of Task, or MET, score, which is a multiple of a person\u2019s base resting rate, used to calculate an estimated calorie burn based on the individual\u2019s weight.\u00a0 Further, it looked at mood changes post-exercise and found they were consistent for what you\u2019d expect after vigorous exercise, with participants reporting they felt \u201cfull of pep\u201d and \u201clively\u201d after the workouts.\u00a0 \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of skepticism because [VR fitness] is very new,\u201d Leanne Pedante, Supernatural head of fitness and one of six coaches who guide Supernatural users through its more than 3,000 workouts (at a subscription price of $10 a month or $100 a year), tells Fortune. There is often a\u00a0 misunderstanding that \u201cyou\u2019re not really moving\u201d with VR workouts, and that it\u2019s like a video game, with a perception that \u201cit\u2019s kind of passive, and not an activity where you would actually move enough to sweat.\u201d The study, Pedante adds, \u201chelps us ground it with cycling, jogging, boxing\u2014things that people are familiar with.\u201d The study was commissioned and paid for by Meta but carried out independently, led by the University\u2019s School of Exercise Science professor Ryan Rhodes, whose focus of research has been \u201cthe psychology of enjoyment and being engaged in what you\u2019re doing,\u201d noted a press release on the study. \u201cA lot of exercise is an act of willpower for people,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, running on a treadmill is not exactly a fun, engaging activity. We do it because it\u2019s good for us but, ultimately, it can be difficult to stick with it.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s where VR technology can step in.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing something like this VR app, it really feels like you\u2019re standing in the middle of Antarctica or you could be on a beautiful beach,\u201d he says. \u201cThat can add to the experience.\u201d The study\u2019s results track with other similar findings, including a 2020 systematic review which suggested that \u201cVR exercise has the potential to exert a positive impact on an individual\u2019s physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes compared with traditional exercise,\u201d as well as a Supernatural assessment by the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise. That organization, formed in 2017 by kinesiologists to study the effects of VR fitness on the body, assigns ratings to VR workouts\u2014others include FitXR and Litesport\u2014based on METs, as with the new study. In rating the Supernatural Boxing game, it found that its combination of straight jabs, hooks, uppercuts, and blocks made for good, vigorous exercise, with an exertion level most equivalent to real-life cycling. \u201cLooking at the [new Meta] study, I think that their results seem very reasonable,\u201d Aaron Stanton, director of the Institute. \u201cThey registered an average MET score of 7.89 METs, and our testing actually rated it higher than that, at 11.44 METs. Their testing was lower than ours, and so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re likely exaggerating.\u201d (Note from this writer: They weren\u2019t.) Another reason some people may be skeptical of VR workouts, Pedante says, is that, especially post-COVID, they \u201cfocus on the isolation part. I hear a lot of that, the idea that you\u2019re kind of leaving the real world.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cThe goal has never been that we want people to stop doing things in the real world. The goal is to make sure people find places within VR that can serve their needs in a way that isn\u2019t getting served.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s something she sees frequently with Supernatural fans, including, \u201cPeople who haven\u2019t been able to make home workouts stick who are now three years in with this because it\u2019s fun.\u201d The \u201cgamification,\u201d she notes, is helpful, providing the same sort of competitive vibe you\u2019d get in a group fitness class. \u201cIt helps to give you some sort of metric to align yourself with, to chase after.\u201d Further, while the workouts are indeed solo activities, that hasn\u2019t stopped superfans from creating communities\u2014including a Facebook community page with 108,000 members and real-life meetups happening around the country, including one group making a pilgrimage to hike the actual Tom Dick and Harry Mountain in Oregon that serves as the virtual backdrop for one of the Supernatural workouts.\u00a0 \u201cI often go to the Facebook page for inspiration, and to see what workouts are coming out, what people are achieving,\u201d Jessa Curcillo, 45, tells Fortune. \u201cThe collective excitement keeps my motivation going.\u201d The Columbus, Ohio mom of four kids between 10 and 16 says that Supernatural helped bring fitness back into her life full-throttle, as it has previously been something she \u201cendured for the results.\u201d\u00a0 Doing these workouts for about 30 minutes a day, she says, \u201creally changed my mindset about fitness. I really felt like I was cheating the system, like it was a vacation just for me.\u201d As a contract worker, her schedule is flexible, and while she does other real-life exercising here and there, Supernatural is her main workout.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m kind of in a phase of my life that is pure chaos, so if not for this, I couldn\u2019t fit fitness into my life,\u201d she says. Pedante points to people like Curcillo as the reason why Supernatural\u2019s stickiness is so important\u2014especially considering that no more than 28% of Americans met the combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, per the CDC.\u00a0 \u201cWe see it all the time\u2014people who hadn\u2019t been able to make home workouts stick who are now three years in because it\u2019s so fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a massive benefit all of us [coaches] have seen, and we want more people to know the solution is there for them.\u201d More on fitness and exercise: \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The capital of San Juan was left without power, as well as neighboring municipalities including Bayam\u00f3n, Caguas and Carolina. Luma Energy, which operates transmission and distribution for Puerto Rico\u2019s power authority, said on X that the outage was tied to an issue with the power plants\u2019 transmission lines. It provided a statement to The Associated Press saying it was investigating the outage that coincided with the shutdown of units operated by Genera PR, which operates and maintains state power generation units. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi condemned the outage and said he was demanding answers and solutions from Luma and Genera PR. \u201cThe events that have been occurring in recent weeks with our electrical system are unacceptable,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cWhile it is true that we have old plants and transmission lines in terrible condition, the people continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of sense of urgency that private operators are demonstrating.\u201d Both Luma and Genera PR were selected as private operators under Pierluisi\u2019s administration. The outage is the most recent in a string of blackouts to hit Puerto Rico, which is still trying to rebuild the grid after Hurricane Maria razed it in 2017 as a Category 4 storm. The outage prompted the mayor of the San Juan capital, Miguel Romero, to declare a state of emergency late Wednesday as he accused Luma of sharing limited information about the ongoing blackouts. \u201cThere are thousands of children with specific feeding needs, as well as older adults who often need therapy machines to protect their health and often save their lives,\u201d the decree stated. Scores of Puerto Ricans took to social media to condemn the most recent outage and demand the ouster of Luma, noting that it occurred amid excessive heat warnings.

Wes Moore said at a waterside news conference to highlight the milestone. As the governor spoke, a passing ship blasted its horn. \u201cYou hear that?\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful sound.\u201d Behind him, giant cranes lifted shipping containers from the deck of a docked cargo ship and deposited them on land. Many shipping companies\u00a0rerouted their cargo\u00a0to other ports following the\u00a0deadly collapse\u00a0in March. The deadly disaster halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore\u2019s busy port as crews worked around the clock to clear an estimated 50,000 tons of fallen steel and concrete from the Patapsco River. The estimated cost for the entire salvage operation is $160 million, with federal, state and local agencies involved. Companies that steered clear of Baltimore during the cleanup will likely come back now that the channel has been returned to its original depth and width, officials said. The port, which processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country, is expected to be operating at normal capacity by mid-July. All that rerouted commercial traffic \u201cbelongs in Baltimore today,\u201d U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news briefing earlier this week. \u201cWe have every indication that that is what is taking place, but we will be reinforcing that expectation as we speak with players up and down the supply chains.\u201d Crews were able to\u00a0reopen portions\u00a0of the deep-draft channel in phases, restoring some commercial traffic in recent weeks. Some cruise ships and large container ships have already passed through, officials said. But thousands of longshoremen, truckers and small business owners have seen their jobs impacted by the collapse and its\u00a0economic ripple effects, which extend well beyond the Baltimore region. State officials helped establish several relief programs to keep people employed and businesses afloat in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe were a wounded port,\u201d said Scott Cowan, president of the International Longshoreman\u2019s Association Local 333, which represents Baltimore port workers. In a competitive industry, he said, other ports were looking to take Baltimore\u2019s cargo. Reopening the channel means keeping thousands of longshoremen in their jobs, Cowan said. Officials estimated that the salvage operations for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will cost up to $75 million, while the Coast Guard response has cost $24 million to date to open the main channel. Maryland used about $60 million in federal emergency funds to open three other smaller channels outside the main one. Rebuilding the bridge could cost nearly $2 billion, officials have said. They hope it\u2019s completed by 2028. President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the full cost of rebuilding, though officials said the funding is still awaiting approval from Congress. In a statement Tuesday, Biden praised the work of everyone involved in the recovery effort. \u201cBaltimore can count on us to stick with them every step of the way, and we will continue to have your back until the bridge is rebuilt,\u201d he said. The cargo ship Dali lost power and crashed into a critical support column of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, collapsing the span and sending six members of a roadwork crew\u00a0plunging to their deaths. A National Transportation Safety Board\u00a0investigation found\u00a0that the vessel experienced power outages before starting its voyage, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with a massive steel truss draped across its damaged bow, before\u00a0being refloated\u00a0and guided back to port May 20. That allowed officials to open a channel that was 50 feet (15 meters) deep and 400 feet (122 meters) wide, big enough for most of the largest commercial vessels. The full federal shipping channel is 700 feet (213 meters) wide. Officials said two-way traffic can now resume, and additional safety requirements have also been lifted because of the increased width. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Two men, one with a light strapped to his head, got out. A security camera recorded them pulling out bolt cutters. One man snipped several charging cables; the other loaded them into the truck. In under 2\u00bd minutes, they were gone. The scene that night has become part of a troubling pattern across the country: Thieves have been targeting EV charging stations, intent on stealing the cables, which contain copper wiring. The price of copper is near a record high on global markets, which means criminals stand to collect rising sums of cash from selling the material. The stolen cables often disable entire stations, forcing EV owners on the road to search desperately for a working charger. For the owners, the predicament can be exasperating and stressful. Broken-down chargers have emerged as the latest obstacle for U.S. automakers in their strenuous effort to convert more Americans to EVs despite widespread public anxiety about a scarcity of charging stations.\u00a0About 4 in 10 U.S. adults\u00a0say they believe EVs take too long to charge or don\u2019t know of any charging stations nearby. If even finding a charging station doesn\u2019t necessarily mean finding functioning cables, it becomes one more reason for skeptical buyers to stick with traditional gasoline-fueled or hybrid vehicles, at least for now. America\u2019s major automakers have made heavy financial bets that buyers will shift away from combustion engines and embrace EVs as the world faces the worsening consequences of climate change. Accordingly, the companies have poured billions into EVs. Stellantis envisions 50% of its passenger cars being EVs by the end of 2030. Ford set a target of producing 2 million EVs per year by 2026 \u2014 about 45% of its global sales \u2014 though it has since suspended that goal. General Motors, the most ambitious of the three, has pledged to sell only EV passenger cars by the end of 2035. Any such timetables, of course, hinge on whether the companies can convince more would-be EV buyers that a charge will always be available when they travel. The rise in cable thefts isn\u2019t likely to strengthen the automakers\u2019 case. Two years ago, according to Electrify America, which runs the nation\u2019s second-largest network of direct-current fast chargers, a cable might be cut perhaps every six months at one of its 968 charging stations, with 4,400 plugs nationwide. Through May this year, the figure reached 129 \u2014 four more than in all of 2023. At one Seattle station, cables were cut six times in the past year, said Anthony Lambkin, Electrify America\u2019s vice president of operations. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling people to get to work, to take their kids to school, get to medical appointments,\u201d Lambkin said. \u201cSo to have an entire station that\u2019s offline is pretty impactful to our customers.\u201d Two other leading EV charging companies \u2014 Flo and EVgo \u2014 also have reported a rise in thefts. Charging stations in the Seattle area have been a frequent target. Sites in Nevada, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Pennsylvania have been hit, too. Stations run by Tesla, which operates the nation\u2019s largest fast-charging network, have been struck in Seattle, Oakland and Houston. So far this year, Seattle police have reported seven cases of cable thefts from charging stations, matching the number for all of 2023. Thieves hit Tesla stations four times this year compared with just once last year, the Seattle police said. \u201cVandalism of public charging infrastructure in the Seattle metro area has unfortunately been increasing in frequency,\u201d EVgo said. The company said law enforcement officials are investigating the thefts while it tries to repair inoperable stations and considers a longer-term solution. The problem isn\u2019t confined to urban areas. In rural Sumner, Washington, south of Seattle, thieves cut cables twice at a Puget Sound Energy charging station. The company is working with police and the property owner to protect the station. Until a month ago, police in Houston knew of no cable thefts. Then one was stolen from a charger at a gas station. The city has now recorded eight or nine such thefts, said Sgt. Robert Carson, who leads a police metal-theft unit. In one case, thieves swiped 18 of 19 cords at a Tesla station. That day, Carson visited the station to inspect the damage. In the first five minutes that he was there, Carson said, about 10 EVs that needed charging had to be turned away. In very large cities like Houston, charging stations typically contain an especially large number of plugs and cables, so thefts can be particularly damaging. \u201cThey\u2019re not just taking one,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re hit, they\u2019re hit pretty hard.\u201d Roy Manuel, an Uber driver who normally recharges his Tesla at the Houston station hit by thieves, said he fears being unable to do so because of stolen cables. \u201cIf my battery was really low, I\u2019d have quite an issue with operating my vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was so low that I couldn\u2019t get to another charger, I might be in trouble. Might even need a tow truck.\u201d The charging companies say it\u2019s become clear that the thieves are after the copper that the cables contain. In late May, copper hit a record high of nearly $5.20 a pound, a result, in part, of rising demand resulting from efforts to cut carbon emissions with EVs that use more copper wiring. The price is up about 25% from a year ago, and many analysts envision further increases. Charging companies say there isn\u2019t actually very much copper in the cables, and what copper is there is difficult to extract. Carson estimates that criminals can get $15 to $20 per cable at a scrap yard. \u201cThey\u2019re not making a significant amount of money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be sailing on a yacht anywhere.\u201d Still, the more cables the thieves can steal, the more they can cash in. At $20 a cable, 20 stolen cables could fetch $400. The problem for the charging companies is that it\u2019s much costlier to replace cables. In Minneapolis, where cables have been clipped at city-owned charging stations, it costs about $1,000 to replace just one cable, said Joe Laurin, project manager in the Department of Public Works. The charging companies are trying to fight back. Electrify America is installing more security cameras. In Houston, police are visiting recycling centers to look for stolen metal. But it\u2019s often hard for the scrap yards to determine conclusively whether metal came from a charging cable. Thieves often burn off the insulation and just sell strands of metal. The Recycled Materials Association, which represents 1,700 members, is issuing scrap-theft alerts from law enforcement officials so that members can be on the lookout for suspects and stolen goods. Because charging stations are often situated in remote corners of parking lots, Carson suggested that many more security cameras are needed. In the meantime, Electrify America said Seattle police are trying to track down the thieves in the video. And Carson said the Houston police are pursuing leads in the Tesla theft. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get them stopped,\u201d he said, \u201cand then let the court system do what they\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

There was rudeness in meetings, gatekeeping of important information, ignoring her contributions in Slack room discussions, and gaslighting about it all, including from a series of managers. It eventually all took a toll.\u00a0 \u201cIt affected my self-esteem, big-time,\u201d Angela, who is being identified by her middle name for privacy,  tells Fortune. \u201c\u2018Rude\u2019 isn\u2019t a performance metric. Basic human communication is not a part of what was discussed or expected, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. To me it\u2019s about basic respect.\u201d She frequently thought about leaving, but her job was a good one, and she was hesitant. Still, she says, \u201cI was boxed out \u2026 At what point do you throw in the towel?\u201d The behavior eventually got so bad that it sent her to therapy\u2014and, finally, out the door. Now, still shaken and questioning her skills as a result of the experience, she\u2019s seriously considering a career change, noting, \u201cIt was really bad for my psyche.\u201d And she\u2019s far from alone. On Glassdoor discussion boards, there\u2019s an endless scroll of people talking about being treated poorly at work\u2014distrusting themselves because a boss questions every move, or facing aggression and gaslighting from coworkers to the point of experiencing \u201ccrippling dread and anxiety\u201d and even \u201cPTSD.\u201d It\u2019s all part of what human resource experts see as a rise in what\u2019s called workplace incivility\u2014behavior that is inconsiderate or rude that \u201cviolates social norms for workplace behavior and that leads to negative effects for the employee as well as the organization,\u201d according to John O\u2019Brien, a psychologist and executive coach with a forthcoming book on the topic.\u00a0 It\u2019s unlike bullying, which is more easily identifiable and \u201cmuch more often intentional, usually with a specific target, and meant to intimidate someone so that the bully can have some certain outcome,\u201d O\u2019Brien explains. And it could be an element of \u201ctoxicity,\u201d which is more of a catchall about high-stress environments. But incivility, he says, is more often, though not always, unintentional. It\u2019s a collection of \u201cstress-related behaviors that emerge spontaneously and may be seemingly inconsequential, such as eye-rolling,\u201d and which feeling upset over might be brushed off by others as \u201coverreacting.\u201d\u00a0 A March 2024 survey of over 1,600 U.S. employees by the membership-based Society for Human Resource Management found that 66% had experienced or witnessed incivility at work within the past month, while 57% had experienced or witnessed such behavior within the past week\u2014with the most common forms of incivility being addressing others disrespectfully (36%), interrupting others who are speaking (34%), and excessive micromanaging (32%).\u00a0 It also found only 25% believe their managers are effective at handling incivility when it rears its ugly head. Further, a 2022 survey of 2,000 global workers by Georgetown University professor of management Christine Porath found that 76% and 78% of respondents, respectively, experience or witness incivility at least once a month, while 78% believe that bad behavior from customers toward employees is more common than it was five years ago.\u00a0 \u201cThere is such an increase,\u201d Joyce Russell, an executive coach and Dean Emeritus and Professor of Management at the Villanova School of Business, tells Fortune. \u201cI hear this from a lot of people.\u201d When she offered a monthly chat to leaders on the topic recently, she says, \u201cthey jumped on the call and just had example after example.\u201d\u00a0 Among them: People ignoring others, sending \u201cnot nice\u201d emails to an employee and copying everybody, spreading rumors, gossiping, eye rolling in meetings, taking credit for the work of others, and being quick to assign blame and never taking responsibility for problems. \u201cThey\u2019re behaviors that have always existed,\u201d Russell says, \u201cbut people feel like they\u2019re more acceptable now.\u201d\u00a0 O\u2019Brien, who has also noticed the rise and believes it mirrors the increasing lack of incivility in society at large, attributes it to a number of factors, including that most ubiquitous of culprits: social media.\u00a0 \u201cThe more impersonal ways of communicating I think is part of it,\u201d he says, though there\u2019s more to it, as well.  \u201cStress levels in society have risen and, even prior to the pandemic, levels of depression and anxiety were rising, and I think that has contributed to it,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus the political landscape and cycle that we are in right now\u2014of people getting rewarded for negative behaviors at the national level.\u201d\u00a0 Then there are America\u2019s deep political divisions, the fact that many of us have not yet readjusted to coming together in person, and leftover stress from the pandemic. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know where to put that,\u201d he says, \u201cand if there\u2019s not a lot of emotional intelligence, it comes leaking out in certain ways.\u201d\u00a0 While \u201cblatant bullying\u201d is easier to be aware of, point out, and report, says Russell, \u201csmaller signs of disrespect that people are giving each other\u201d are a little harder to pinpoint. She stresses, though, that such behaviors almost always come from the top down\u2014whether leaders are behaving unethically themselves or simply failing to take action against others who do, thereby condoning it. \u201cWe see this at the highest levels, even from the previous Administration,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople always look to the leaders, even in firms\u2026 If they\u2019re not taking action, then other people think, well, it\u2019s OK. You see a difference in companies where leaders take action or demonstrate better behaviors.\u201d\u00a0 When subject to uncivil behaviors, whether by coworkers, leaders, or customers\/patients, O\u2019Brien says, \u201cPeople\u2019s stress levels rise, so they find themselves more tense, irritable, and maybe more reactive.\u201d\u00a0 It can also exacerbate mental health issues, he adds, explaining that for people already at risk of depression and anxiety, dealing with workplace incivility \u201ccan sometimes be one of the major stressors that triggers a level that may need medical attention.\u201d Plus, quality of work will typically suffer, from standpoints of both productivity and engagement. \u201cMany wind up losing time at work ruminating about the incident,\u201d says O\u2019Brien, who adds that often, those who get treated poorly in turn treat others that way\u2014so the fallout is both \u201cindividual and systemic.\u201d\u00a0 Also huge, says Russell, is how workplace incivility impacts morale\u2014and how it continues the buildup of stress very likely still lingering from pandemic times. \u201cCOVID was such an impactful experience, and I don\u2019t know that we allowed people the time to recuperate from that \u2026 People feel overworked and tired, and they just got right back into the race.\u201d Feeling abused on top of it all, she says, \u201ccan mean people not wanting to be as loyal or committed\u201d to a workplace.\u00a0 So what\u2019s a fed-up employee to do?\u00a0 O\u2019Brien suggests people start by trying immediate, direct options, such as having a conversation with the person who has been uncivil. It could also be helpful to consider that the offender may have been so unintentionally.\u00a0 \u201cOne classic example is someone who is interrupting others in meetings,\u201d he says. \u201dYou may assume they don\u2019t respect your opinion, but in fact there may be something else completely going on. They may have trouble with impulse control.\u201d Sometimes, he suggests, talking through what happened with a boss or a mentor or a peer can help in figuring out how to approach the situation. \u201cEven talking to friends outside of the organization,\u201d O\u2019Brien suggests. \u201cAnd if it starts to rise to a level of more significant distress, getting into therapy or seeking out a coach.\u201d Through those discussions, he says, it will be helpful to think about whether or not incivility is the norm at your company. \u201cIf that\u2019s the norm, then maybe they have to find a different work environment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s the exception as opposed to the rule.\u201d For leaders, Russell says that bringing in a mediator to help with difficult situations could be \u201ca really good solution, because you\u2019re getting people to try to work together.\u201d\u00a0 And in general, she adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think people have good skills with conflict management.\u201d It\u2019s why an outsider could be helpful. But doing more in organizations to properly train leaders to manage and understand conflict can go a long way in battling incivility, she stresses\u2014as can establishing codes of conduct, which she calls \u201ccritical.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt all sounds like common sense, but people have gotten away from behaving the way they need to,\u201d Russell says. \u201cAnd it starts with the leader who can set the right tone and establish guidelines.\u201d More on workplace well-being: \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Chinese carmakers sold 13.43 million cars last year, outpacing the 11.93 million cars sold by American companies, according to a report by automotive data company JATO Dynamics. Warren Buffett-backed EV maker BYD produced the most popular Chinese car, a compact sedan called the Qin, and had two other vehicles in the top 25 most sold cars last year. Tesla, for its part, claimed the title of the best selling car in 2023 with the Model Y. In a Tesla earnings call in January, Musk praised Chinese automakers, calling them the \u201cmost competitive\u201d carmakers in the world. He also warned against Chinese automakers\u2019 rapid growth. \u201cIf there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk said at the time. That prediction may slowly be coming true as \u200b\u200bChinese car brands look abroad to spur growth after seeing demand fall in China. Last year, Chinese automakers trailed only Japanese and European automakers in terms of global light vehicle sales, according to the report. Felipe Mu\u00f1oz, a senior analyst at JATO Dynamics, said the conformity of legacy carmakers is partly to blame for the rise of strong Chinese competitors. \u201cNegligence from legacy automakers, which has resulted in consistently high car prices, has inadvertently driven consumers towards more affordable Chinese alternatives,\u201d Munoz said in a statement. \u201cAs car prices continue to rise elsewhere, Chinese car brands are capitalizing on this trend to gain market traction at a much faster pace.\u201d Confronted with the might of China\u2019s growing auto sector, some legacy carmakers are taking action to compete. In Japan, two of its biggest automakers, Nissan and Honda, announced a partnership in March to compete with China on electric vehicles.\u00a0 Some politicians have accused Chinese carmakers of unethical behavior while attempting\u00a0 to stymie their threat through tariffs. This week, the European Commission slapped three Chinese automakers, including BYD, with import tariffs ranging from 17.4% to 38.1% following a probe by the commission that found battery electric vehicles from China benefited from state subsidies unfair to global competition.\u00a0 In May, President Joe Biden also increased the tariff on imported Chinese electric vehicles to 102.5% up from the previous rate of 27.5%.\u00a0 \u201cChina\u2019s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I\u2019m not going to let that happen on my watch,\u201d Biden said in a previous statement this year. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The company\u2019s market cap has increased 160% in the past six months, up to $3.10 trillion, as the rush to cash in on A.I. has launched the chip maker into position as the third most valuable company in the world, trailing only Apple ($3.30 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.25 trillion).\u00a0 For Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, it\u2019s been an equally meteoric come up. Huang\u2019s wealth surged more than $62 billion this year, up to $106.1 billion, and he leapfrogged fellow tech star Michael Dell to become the 13th-richest person on the planet.\u00a0 But the man at the helm of Nvidia\u2019s historic rise hasn\u2019t sugarcoated how difficult the road to success was, either for himself, or the company he founded more than 30 years ago.\u00a0 When Nvidia started in 1993, Huang, along with co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began with an idea of creating chips that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers\u2014or graphic processing units, specifically for video games.\u00a0 But speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in 2018, Huang told audience members that he always believed GPUs could have broader applications in society, otherwise there would have been \u201cno point in starting a company.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to start a company; it\u2019s incredibly hard to start a business,\u201d Huang said at the conference. \u201cThe depth of despair, the suffering, the torture\u2014balanced by the great joy of doing something the world has never done before\u2014is beyond words can describe. So unless you believe you\u2019re going to make a real contribution to society it\u2019s going to be incredibly hard to start that journey.\u201d The reason Nvidia got its start in gaming, Haung said, was that video games were the only area in technology where the computational potential was incredibly advanced, but there was also an enormous demand among consumers.\u00a0 Once they realized the potential scale of GPU servers, Huang said they were able to move into workstations, supercomputers, self-driving cars, and ultimately A.I. But all of that was only possible because of PC gaming. \u201c3D graphics and video games are the engine of innovation in our company, the engine of [research and development] scale,\u201d he said at the conference.\u00a0 Huang has made other, more recent comments that paint a picture of entrepreneurship that is far from idyllic.\u00a0 During an interview on a podcast in the fall of 2023, Huang was asked what kind of company he would think about starting if he could turn back the clock 30 years, and the engineer-turned-executive had a somewhat surprising response.\u00a0 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cIf we realized the pain and suffering [involved] and just how vulnerable you\u2019re going to feel, the challenges that you\u2019re going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong\u2014I don\u2019t think anybody would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it.\u201d\u00a0 Correction, June 14, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization in the headline. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

In a petition filed with the federal agency, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project argues that the EPA should have already followed up on the tests of gardens and crops in the city where the Norfolk Southern derailment took place. \u201cIt is unconscionable that the EPA has not conducted its own testing on garden crops in East Palestine, nor have they sampled for dioxins in the home produce,\u201d the nonprofit group\u2019s senior environmental officer, Lesley Pacey, told The Associated Press in advance of the petition filing. \u201cYet, the EPA has told residents to garden and eat home produce as usual.\u201d The Associated Press sent emails to EPA officials seeking comment about the petition Thursday. The agency has been telling people it\u2019s safe to garden since nearly three months after the February 2023 derailment, based on tests conducted by state agriculture officials at 31 locations around town and on surrounding farms. The officials tested winter wheat, malting barley, pasture grasses and rye from area farms. \u201cResidential soil sampling results are within typical ranges for the area, and garden plants are generally considered safe to eat,\u201d the EPA said to the community. In the past, agency officials have dismissed the independent tests cited by the Government Accountability Project, pointing to their concerns with quality control. The tests were performed by Scott Smith, a businessman and inventor who, since his own factory was inundated by tainted floodwaters in 2006, has been on a crusade to help communities affected by chemical disasters. EPA officials say they can\u2019t tell if his data is valid without reviewing all of the reports detailing his methodology and results. Smith offered last summer to share his files with the agency but only if it would share its information with him. They never reached an agreement. The EPA has said that previous testing conducted by contractors hired by the railroad did not show high levels of dioxins or other chemicals outside the train derailment site after the initial evacuation order was lifted, and therefore, additional tests in individual yards and gardens weren\u2019t needed. The only place the\u00a0EPA reported\u00a0finding high levels of cancer-causing dioxins was in the area immediately around the derailment about two weeks after the crash. That soil was included in the nearly 179,000 tons (71,668 metric tons) of material dug up and disposed of last year. But some residents aren\u2019t taking any chances. Marilyn Figley didn\u2019t dare plant a garden last year after the derailment even though she and her husband do everything they can to be self-sufficient, including gardening and raising chickens for meat and eggs. She did harvest some garlic after the derailment that she had planted previously, however. Some of it had levels of dioxins more than 500 times higher than a sample of garlic grown and harvested from someone else\u2019s yard the year before the derailment, according to Smith\u2019s tests. Figley said they decided to plant a garden again this year after using one of her husband\u2019s tractors to remove the top 3 inches (8 centimeters) of soil and replace that with fresh dirt. \u201cI\u2019d rather eat dioxins than die of starvation I guess,\u201d Figley said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty worried, but what can you do?\u201d Dioxins have been a\u00a0key concern\u00a0for East Palestine residents ever since officials decided to\u00a0blow open five tank cars\u00a0of the derailed train and burn the vinyl chloride contained within them. The chemical is used to make\u00a0a variety of plastic products,\u00a0including pipes, wire and packaging materials, and is found in polyvinyl chloride plastic, better known as PVC. Thousands of residents had to evacuate their homes temporarily after the derailment and during the venting and burning of the vinyl chloride, which sent an enormous toxic plume of black smoke over the town. Last summer, the local farmers market made a point of bringing in produce from several states away because of all the worries about anything grown in the area. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t eat anybody\u2019s tomatoes or cucumbers,\u201d said Tamara Lynn Freeze, whose freshly grown garlic was also tested by Smith and showed dioxin levels five times higher than what was found in garlic she still had sitting in her garage from a year before the derailment. Freeze says she developed a chronic sinus infection and joint pain after the derailment \u2014 symptoms that seem to ease any time she\u2019s away from the area for more than a few hours. Smith has visited East Palestine more than two dozen times since the derailment to test soil and water for dioxins and other chemicals. He is not a scientist by training but has traveled to chemical disaster sites for years. His testing is reviewed by a team of scientific advisers, including a former top Ohio EPA expert, and he sends all his samples to a laboratory that the EPA and others agree is reputable. Smith is also an inventor and holds 25 patents, including for a specialized foam that repels water and absorbs oil, which he developed at his former company, Cellect Technologies. He has offered to sell the product in some of the affected communities he has visited, but he says he isn\u2019t making a profit on his work in East Palestine. Smith got his start with disasters when floodwater contaminated with chemicals swept into a Cellect factory, destroying equipment and forcing the business to shut down for months. Since then, he has conducted investigations of dozens of environmental and health emergencies, including the\u00a0BP Gulf oil spill\u00a0and the\u00a0Flint, Michigan, lead water crisis. In Flint, some of Smith\u2019s results were used by a nonprofit group affiliated with actor Mark Ruffalo that questioned whether it was\u00a0safe to bathe in the city\u2019s water. Smith\u2019s actions put him in conflict with scientists who were conducting their own tests and with EPA Response Coordinator Mark Durno, the same agency representative overseeing the cleanup in East Palestine. Despite their disagreements, Durno did remark that Smith \u201ccertainly understands how to use appropriate laboratories both for the chemical work that he\u2019s doing and the biological work that he is doing.\u201d \u201cFrom that perspective, he seems qualified to collect samples and collect and share data,\u201d Durno said in a\u00a0video interview\u00a0he gave for an unfinished documentary about Smith\u2019s work. But in East Palestine, Durno has consistently questioned the quality of Smith\u2019s testing. Since last summer, he has refused to meet with him or test alongside him because he believes the EPA\u2019s testing plan already gives an objective, valid sense of the level of contamination existing in the community. He added that testing in individual locations in town, as Smith is doing, won\u2019t produce useful data if it isn\u2019t part of a larger sampling plan. Smith said he has applied the\u00a0lessons of Flint\u00a0by making sure that his scientific advisers review all his data before he releases it himself directly to the public. He argues that even if his test results aren\u2019t perfect, they should prompt additional investigation by the EPA. \u201cI\u2019m basically calling for more testing,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to incite more panic. My point is it\u2019d be very easy for the EPA to just test the garlic and report it. We can find no evidence they ever tested garden crops from residents.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Some may struggle to understand or relate to them, but it\u2019s increasingly clear that Gen Z is a generation of doers. They take action and want to call the shots. So it isn\u2019t surprising that many young people are enticed by entrepreneurship. According to the first edition of Jobber\u2019s Blue-Collar Report, in which we surveyed 1,000 people aged 18 to 20 in the U.S., nearly two-thirds (63%) said they want to start their own business at some point in their lives\u2014and 11% already have. That\u2019s great news. Small business is the engine of our economy. But what businesses should they be starting? The glaringly obvious answer lies in the trades. We\u2019ve also spoken to thousands of home service business owners\u2014and finding reliable labor is a challenge that every one of them faces. If you\u2019ve tried to call a plumber, an HVAC tech, or any number of tradespeople to do work around your home, you\u2019ve likely experienced the labor shortage firsthand.\u00a0 Homes and other infrastructure are getting older. Today, the median owner-occupied home in the U.S. is 40 years old, which means there\u2019s a growing need for repairs, maintenance, and remodeling of the aging housing stock. At the same time, skilled workers are retiring, and there aren\u2019t enough young people coming into the trades to take their place. Experts are predicting there will be 73,500 openings each year for electricians alone until 2032. This leads to delays in service and drives up the cost for consumers. The labor shortage is a major problem but also a massive opportunity for ambitious young people to come in and fill the gap. Thankfully, we\u2019re seeing Gen Z show an interest in seizing this opportunity. Three-quarters (75%) of our respondents say they are interested in exploring vocational schools that offer paid, on-the-job training. They\u2019re worried about repaying loans and want to get started building their careers without going into debt. They\u2019re also looking for stable employment. Job security was identified by respondents as one of the most important factors for selecting a career. They\u2019re hyper-aware of advancements in technology and artificial intelligence and are concerned about pursuing jobs that could be disrupted by automation in the years ahead, many of which are in white-collar industries. This trend is gaining momentum, and the number of students enrolled in vocational-focused community colleges is increasing. Enrollment rose 16% last year to its highest level since the National Student Clearinghouse began tracking this data in 2018. But this isn\u2019t enough to fill the gap. There\u2019s still a stigma associated with trade careers and society continues to overstress that traditional college degrees are the only path to success. 74% of our respondents hold the belief there\u2019s a stigma associated with going to a vocational school over a traditional four-year university and 79% say their parents want them to pursue a college education after high school, while only 5% say the same about vocational school. Another obstacle is that Gen Z underestimates the earning potential of the trades. The majority of our survey respondents believe it\u2019s not possible to generate seven-figure revenues in tree care, lawn care, or plumbing. However, our data of 200,000+ service pros reveals that it\u2019s not just construction businesses that can earn big profits. More than 50% of tree care, lawn care, and plumbing businesses earn at least $1 million each year. Chase Gallagher owns one of these businesses. Chase started his lawn care and landscaping business, CMG Landscaping, when he was just 13 years old. In the time that it took for his peers to graduate college, he\u2019s built his business into a multi-million dollar venture and he\u2019s pursuing his dream. His story is just one of many like it.\u00a0 To address the shortage of trades workers and get more young people involved, we can start by investing in and promoting the entrepreneurial and financial opportunities provided by the trades through the media, social media, and across our communities. Parents, influencers, and educators should encourage young people to explore more diverse career options and to consider the trades as a profitable and satisfying career. Vocational programs should be promoted early on, alongside traditional colleges. We need to support businesses that want to provide training and apprenticeship opportunities. In addition to pushing for more government funding in this area, if you know of a business that offers apprenticeships or mentors youth in your community, think of them first the next time you need some work done. We can do a lot to reverse the stigma associated with the trades. Sharing stories like Chase\u2019s helps, but it can also be as simple as showing respect for these workers and thanking them for everything they do. We need to recognize and value the essential work of trades professionals. Together, these actions can unlock a massive opportunity for the next generation, small businesses, and the economy.

Stable or rising interest rates could keep bond prices in a bear market, the former Bridgewater exec explained. And stocks may not be able to meet Wall Street\u2019s lofty forecasts without some profit-juicing Fed policy. Analysts are expecting a more than 11% jump in S&P 500 earnings this year, according to FactSet data. \u201cI think the economy is a little too soft to meet equity investors\u2019 expectations of earnings growth, and the economy\u2019s a little too strong to meet bond investors\u2019 expectations of cuts,\u201d Elliott told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly Goldilocks.\u201d Both the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite touched record highs this week after a cooler-than-expected inflation report lifted investors\u2019 hopes for a September interest rate cut and an extension of the ongoing AI boom.\u00a0 But Elliott warned that an income-driven economic expansion may keep inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for some time, without providing sufficient growth for corporate earnings to rise substantially.\u00a0 \u201cWe can easily have a moderation of growth\u2014that is meaningfully weaker than what expectations are\u2014which is not enough to tilt the economy into recession, or necessarily solve the inflation problem,\u201d he argued. To his point, wages rose 8.6% in 2022 and 7% in 2023. That\u2019s helped to boost consumer spending and keep inflation elevated. However, annual wage growth slowed to 4.1% in May.\u00a0 Still, Elliott believes too many investors are putting their hopes in friendly Fed policy, which has proven to be difficult to predict, to say the least. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through various waves of expectations of cutting that have mostly not materialized. And you would\u2019ve been in a lot better shape fading those expectations,\u201d he said. Elliott also pointed to high commodity prices as evidence that inflation may be more persistent than originally anticipated, noting that the Community Research Bureau Index, a benchmark for 19 global commodity markets, is up 17% over the past 12 months. For investors that hold the typical 60-40 portfolio\u201460% stocks, 40% bonds\u2014that means it may be time to diversify your holdings to protect against an environment with persistent inflation and low growth. \u201cMy guess is it\u2019s going to be a weak period for assets like stocks and bonds through the end of the year, relative to cash. And that assets like gold and diversified commodities will be valuable complements to the 60-40 portfolio,\u201d Elliott said. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Speaking at TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC conference in Washington, D.C on Tuesday, Khan said the number of cases the FTC brings isn\u2019t as important as the type. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been important for me is to make sure that we\u2019re actually looking at where we see the biggest harm,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhere do we see players that are systematically driving these illegal behaviors? Being able to go after the \u2018mob boss\u2019 is going to be more effective than going after the henchman at the bottom.\u201d\u00a0 Khan has made waves since being appointed chair of the FTC by President Joe Biden in 2021, recently banning non-compete agreements for most employees and attempting to block multiple blockbuster mergers and acquisitions.\u00a0 Earlier this year, she put the brakes on what would have been the biggest fashion deal in history: Coach\u2019s $8.5 billion acquisition of Michael Kors. Coach\u2019s parent brand Tapestry was in talks to purchase Capri Holdings, which owns brands like Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo, before the FTC sued, arguing the acquisition would crush \u201cdirect head-to-head competition.\u201d But big tech has always been Khan\u2019s main focus when it comes to antitrust actions.\u00a0 Last year, the FTC sued Amazon in a landmark lawsuit accusing the retail giant of using illegal methods to maintain its dominance. Also that year, the FTC hoped to ax Microsoft\u2019s roughly $70 billion purchase of the gaming giant Activision Blizzard, but was rejected by U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who said the FTC didn\u2019t prove the deal would hurt competition. More recently, Khan and the FTC have turned toward AI, launching multiple lawsuits against big tech companies, headlined by their recent investigation into Microsoft\u2019s $10 billion investment and ongoing relationship with OpenAI, the $80 billion startup behind ChatGPT. Khan said in January she fears the big tech giant may be able to \u201cexert undue influence or gain privileged access in ways that could undermine fair competition\u201d in the AI arms race. Kahn\u2019s focus on antitrust cases has riled her critics and some investors, with Yale professor Jeffery Sonnenfeld labeling her a \u201ccompetition cop\u201d and CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer claiming she would be a \u201cone-woman wrecking crew for your portfolio,\u201d but she isn\u2019t backing down. Khan argued at TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC conference this week that coddling companies that are considered \u201cnational champions\u201d is the wrong path. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that some of the most significant breakthrough innovations have, historically, come from the startups, and the entrepreneurs, and the small guys who are able to just see things differently\u2014see an opening in the market place and really disrupt in ways that disintermediates the big guys or really provides important competitive checks on them,\u201d she said. The FTC chair referenced key points in history where antitrust legislation has, in her view, boosted competition and led to innovation, including the Eisenhower administration\u2019s 1956 antitrust suit against AT&T\u2019s Bell Labs. Bell Labs was forced to license all its existing telecommunications patents royalty-free after developing a monopoly on the market, a move that increased innovation markedly in the following years, according to multiple studies.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to keep those lessons of history in mind as we again choose a path,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe just need to be very wary of these national champion arguments and really, have faith in open, fair, competitive markets as being what\u2019s going to be the driver of innovation.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Alex Salkever is a Silicon Valley technology executive who has advised dozens of technology companies on strategy and go-to-market. When we wrote The Immigrant Exodus 11 years ago, the imperative to keep the U.S. globally competitive was less clear. China had not yet emerged as a hostile competitor. Artificial intelligence had not accelerated to become a paradigm shift that kills jobs and upends industries. The long-term innovation price of hollowing out the U.S. industrial base was poorly understood by techies and economists alike. But even then, we knew that turning away the best and brightest immigrants would dim the economic and technological future of America. It was painfully obvious. Today, the situation has barely improved. Some limitations on permanent and long-term visas for skilled immigrants in science and technology have eased\u2014but only a bit. The political realities that have held back skilled immigration remain unchanged. The primary local beneficiaries of eased skilled immigration in technology are the West Coast and East Coast cities that are deep blue and companies and industries that are already perceived as wealthy. Immigration reform by executive order has targeted artificial intelligence, which primarily benefits those regions, too. Even with this restrictive reality, the U.S. is more and more reliant on foreign-born workers for STEM jobs. The spurious argument that bringing in more skilled immigrants reduces the wages of existing skilled workers is trotted out repeatedly. There are also other sorts of unhealthy roadblocks, such as the congressionally imposed cap on federal support for graduate medical education through the Medicare program. This cap bottlenecks our ability to train doctors domestically after medical school and plays a major role in the massive physician shortage facing the country. A novel immigration idea could cut through the political red tape and potentially open a path to greater economic prosperity and a heartland revival. Called the \u201cheartland visa,\u201d this relatively new proposal would make it far easier for skilled immigrants to come and work in this country and obtain permanent residency if they spend at least six years working in the so-called \u201cheartland\u201d\u2014effectively, the Rust Belt and other parts of the United States that once enjoyed industrial prosperity but now lag behind the coasts. Applicants who already have a job offer from a company in those regions would have an expedited path to obtaining both an initial work visa and a green card. This proposal echoes Canada\u2019s wise immigration policy, which empowers regions of the country to sponsor visa applicants possessing skills specifically needed by that region\u2019s employers. This approach aligns multiple political stars to make passage far more likely. It focuses on net new job creation in regions where there are fewer skilled jobs. The heartland visa is also designed to revitalize areas that have not had the economic tailwinds of Big Tech, where skilled immigration would likely have a larger multiplier effect. To make the effect even greater, give the highest priority to workers coming to staff startups\u2014the type of company that adds the most jobs and drives the most economic growth. It would also allow for better regional specialization\u2014think electric vehicle factories in South Carolina next to battery production plants or new material science startups close to steel plants. Such a policy would magnify the ongoing revitalization of many beautiful heartland cities and towns that retain the bones of classic homes and buildings and remain far less expensive than their coastal counterparts. If successful, the heartland visa would drive economic development, technology innovation, and national resilience all in one fell swoop. The U.S. remains the world\u2019s most attractive destination for skilled immigrants. Its economy continues to outperform the rest of the world. While China has made great competitive inroads against us, the U.S.\u2019s open culture and embrace of entrepreneurship still make us the greatest melting pot ever created. These talents have driven our economy and will continue to drive it to great heights\u2014if we only let the best and brightest come to America.

Each group revealed its plans if elected into power, including on taxation, health care reform, housing, and education.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a look at the top policies from each party\u2019s manifesto, where they stand on these key topics, and the different directions they take.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The two parties differ the most on this topic, with the Tories wanting to slash taxes, while the Labour Party wants to hike them. Conservatives: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged over \u00a317.2 billion ($22 billion) in tax cuts as the tax burden has climbed to its highest since World War II as a share of the economy. The measure will be funded by a sizable welfare spending cut and any savings accumulated from cracking down on tax evasion.\u00a0 The tax cuts include a reduction in National Insurance contributions, which could cost the Treasury about \u00a310 billion ($12.8 billion) in lost tax income. Labour: Unlike Sunak\u2019s plan, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer wants to raise about \u00a38.5 billion ($10.9 billion) through tax increases such as VAT and windfall tax hikes, in addition to tapering down tax breaks for non-domiciled individuals. The taxes target different areas from what Sunak outlined, and Starmer made a point to delineate the two things. Starmer wants to cap corporate taxes at 25%. Relatedly, the party wants to close a loophole that allows private equity managers to pay a lower rate of capital gains tax on investment returns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT,\u201d Starmer said when launching his manifesto Thursday.\u00a0 Conservatives: The Tories\u2019 measures are targeted at making education more accessible, like introducing free schools for children with special needs. They also want to increase school spending in \u201creal terms per pupil,\u201d Sunak said. The party announced a more nuanced plan to raise the threshold at which families must pay tax for childcare benefits.\u00a0The Tories said in the manifesto that they\u2019re eyeing mandatory National Service \u201cfor all school leavers at 18, with the choice between a competitive placement in the military or civic service roles.\u201d Labour: Starmer, too, has many measures aimed at the education system and U.K. youth. For one, he wants to recruit 6,500 new teachers to overhaul the education system, funded by tax breaks offered to private schools. Separately, the Labour Party also plans to lower the voting age threshold and support parents with free breakfasts for children at primary schools.\u00a0 Conservatives: The Conservatives set out ways they\u2019d help boost first-time homeownership. They also want to introduce a so-called triple lock plus system guaranteeing that pensioners\u2019 state tax isn\u2019t subject to any tax levies and that they receive tax-free allowances.\u00a0\u00a0 Labour: Labour has pledged to invest more pension money in U.K. companies. To support that effort, it plans to set up a National Wealth Fund with \u00a37.3 billion ($9.3 billion) to attract private sector investment in addition to public investment.\u00a0\u00a0 Conservatives: The Conservatives plan to increase NHS spending above inflation to expand the recruitment of nurses and doctors. The group also plans to spend \u00a32.4 billion ($3 billion) on training more medical professionals by the end of the next Parliament and wants to address the \u201csick note culture\u201d by offering more mental health services.\u00a0\u00a0 While it\u2019s unclear how they plan to achieve this, the Tories also want to introduce artificial intelligence in hospital operations and improve NHS productivity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Labour: Starmer\u2019s plan is to significantly cut NHS wait times\u2014with 40,000 new appointments opening up each week. The effort, he said on Thursday, would be funded by doubling down on tax avoidance cases and \u201cnon-dom loopholes.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

He couldn\u2019t flee; there was no one else to turn to,\u201d he added, recognizing that it must have been a \u201cstrange sight\u201d to see a young kid cheer themselves. But that\u2019s what it took to get to the status of a sport\u2019s legend both on and off the courts.\u00a0 \u201cI simply would not let myself fail,\u201d West remembers of the game he played out in his mind, which would prove foundational when he became a professional athlete ad then a coach.\u00a0 West passed away on Wednesday, leaving behind a legacy as a Hall of Famer, record-holder, both coach and player for the Los Angeles Lakers, and high-powered executive. You might recognize West without knowing it, as his image is widely-regarded as the inspiration for the NBA logo itself.\u00a0 During his commencement speech, West noted he was once told there are three types of people in the world\u2014fighters, flee-ers, and floaters\u2014and urged everyone to follow his intentionally placed heavy footsteps, and strive to be fighters. The life of a fighter The former basketball figure had a difficult childhood and dove into the game, in part, as a reprieve from his troubles. Dreaming was key to his success, and pushing for said dream was foundational as he notes those imaginary games were his \u201cway of becoming a fighter.\u201d But that\u2019s not everyone.\u00a0 Some people are floaters, defined by West as someone who \u201cdrifts through life taking things in, going with the current, sharing in success and failure, but seldom determining his own fate.\u201d While these breezy people can avoid pitfalls and accomplish a lot simply by placing themselves in the right spot, their wins are\u2019t truly a feat, he says.\u00a0 \u201cIn my mind, success without a sense of personal accomplishment isn\u2019t success at all. It is merely positioning,\u201d West added, explaining that floaters often see prowess as a financial thing. In his eyes, though, \u201cmoney is a measure of buying power, but seldom is it a measure of success.\u201d Flee-ers follow beneath the floaters, said West, explaining that these people \u201cwill jump from job to job, will run from challenge and opportunity alike.\u201d Likely to shirk accountability and blame others, they really only hurt themselves but can deter a floater, West said. While they might bring a floater down as \u201cmisery needs company,\u201d a fleer-er will find that a fighter is their \u201cworst nightmare.\u201d \u201cA flee-er and a fighter are the opposite ends of the spectrum of self-determination,\u201d West added, claiming that \u201ca fighter is a person that will succeed.\u201d They\u2019re not all that dissimilar from floaters and flee-ers; rather, they\u2019re propelled and differentiated by \u201ca goal, a dream, a vision.\u201d\u00a0 Looking back on his own life, he remembered his \u201cdriveaway basketball games were all about achieving dreams,\u201d which then expanded when got to university and recognized that while he \u201chad a God-given gift, that gift was not going to be enough.\u201d West\u2019s life off the court West\u2019s resolve to reach his objectives, and the resolve of other fighters, were upheld by three traits: character, determination, and resolve. These pillars \u201chelp you stand fast as a fighter, to step above the floater, and to surge beyond the grapes of the fleer-er.\u201d Ultimately, they\u2019re \u201cthe virtues that you can drive to success,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those traits were tested when West left the court and his goals shifted, or became less clear. West said he experienced \u201cself-doubt,\u201d and realized he had to continue to push through with a similar no-failure outlook he had as a player.\u00a0 In reality, being one of the three prototypes is not as immutable as it might seem. \u201cThe path to success is never without its bumps and challenges,\u201d West acknowledged. \u201cThese challenges will create internal battles. These bumps will also create new and exciting opportunities.\u201d In navigating these bumps \u201cyou will again need to draw upon your character, determination and resolve.\u201d And with each fork in the road, \u201cyou will face a new group of floaters, flee-ers and fighters. In fact, you will again have to decide which type of person you are.\u201d In the path to success, there\u2019s bound to be constant obstacles: \u201cEach day you need to get up and decide what kind of person you are because each day is an opportunity to succeed or fail,\u201d West noted. Harkening back to his time on the court, and countless times before that on his driveway, West knew he had it in him to choose to keep believing in himself.\u201cAs my life on the court ended, I decided that I was going to be a fighter. I decided I was again going to lead. I didn\u2019t know how, but I knew what was in me, so I knew that I could,\u201d he said. And lead he did, guiding the Lakers to six championships, becoming a two-time NBA executive of the year, and proving himself a fighter until the very end. Basketball was once just a dream for Jerry West. Shooting hoops for hours in his driveway as a kid, the ball clutched in his hands, his fantasy would inevitably end the same way each time.\u00a0 The clock was ticking, a crowd full of eyes on him, witnessing a split second moment of triumph or defeat. \u201cSuccess or failure was in his hands,\u201d West said of his childhood imagined-self while speaking to the 2008 graduating class at West Virginia University.\u00a0 \u201cHe couldn\u2019t float; he couldn\u2019t depend on someone else. He couldn\u2019t flee; there was no one else to turn to,\u201d he added, recognizing that it must have been a \u201cstrange sight\u201d to see a young kid cheer themselves. But that\u2019s what it took to get to the status of a sport\u2019s legend both on and off the courts.\u00a0 \u201cI simply would not let myself fail,\u201d West remembers of the game he played out in his mind, which would prove foundational when he became a professional athlete ad then a coach.\u00a0 West passed away on Wednesday, leaving behind a legacy as a Hall of Famer, record-holder, both coach and player for the Los Angeles Lakers, and high-powered executive. You might recognize West without knowing it, as his image is widely regarded as the inspiration for the NBA logo itself.\u00a0 During his commencement speech, West noted he was once told there are three types of people in the world\u2014fighters, flee-ers, and floaters\u2014and urged everyone to follow his intentionally placed heavy footsteps, and strive to be fighters. The former basketball figure had a difficult childhood and dove into the game, in part, as a reprieve from his troubles. Dreaming was key to his success, and pushing for said dream was foundational as he notes those imaginary games were his \u201cway of becoming a fighter.\u201d But that\u2019s not everyone.\u00a0 Some people are floaters, defined by West as someone who \u201cdrifts through life taking things in, going with the current, sharing in success and failure, but seldom determining his own fate.\u201d While these breezy people can avoid pitfalls and accomplish a lot simply by placing themselves in the right spot, their wins are\u2019t truly a feat, he says.\u00a0 \u201cIn my mind, success without a sense of personal accomplishment isn\u2019t success at all. It is merely positioning,\u201d West added, explaining that floaters often see prowess as a financial thing. In his eyes, though, \u201cmoney is a measure of buying power, but seldom is it a measure of success.\u201d Flee-ers follow beneath the floaters, said West, explaining that these people \u201cwill jump from job to job, will run from challenge and opportunity alike.\u201d Likely to shirk accountability and blame others, they really only hurt themselves but can deter a floater, West said. While they might bring a floater down as \u201cmisery needs company,\u201d a fleer-er will find that a fighter is their \u201cworst nightmare.\u201d \u201cA flee-er and a fighter are the opposite ends of the spectrum of self-determination,\u201d West added, claiming that \u201ca fighter is a person that will succeed.\u201d They\u2019re not all that dissimilar from floaters and flee-ers; rather, they\u2019re propelled and differentiated by \u201ca goal, a dream, a vision.\u201d\u00a0 Looking back on his own life, he remembered his \u201cdriveaway basketball games were all about achieving dreams,\u201d which then expanded when got to university and recognized that while he \u201chad a God-given gift, that gift was not going to be enough.\u201d West\u2019s resolve to reach his objectives, and the resolve of other fighters, were upheld by three traits: character, determination, and resolve.

For as long as I\u2019ve been a business owner, the narrative surrounding the baby-boomer generation was all about the coming retirement wave. We were promised a mass exodus from the workforce, a seismic shift that would leave companies scrambling to fill the void. At Optima Office, an outsourced accounting and HR company I founded almost six years ago, we began preparing for the shift in the workforce by focusing on high retention. We felt that listening to the needs of our employees was one way to do that. After speaking with some of our baby-boomer employees, I realized that many of them loved their work\u2014and mentoring the younger team members\u2014so much that they didn\u2019t want to hang up their hat when they turned 65. That generation was led to believe that retirement was the dream that they had worked so hard to achieve, but upon reflection, the stark transition from full-time work to full-time retirement felt more like a demotion than a reward.\u00a0 While at many companies the path to retirement is a rigid ladder\u2014climb to the top of your career, hit a designated age, and then retire\u2014this one-size-fits-all approach often leaves retirees grappling with financial anxieties, identity shifts, and a sudden loss of purpose. Some forward-thinking companies are reimagining retirement with a new approach, and I decided we would create an alternative option at Optima Office: flextirement.\u00a0 Flextirement is a flexible work arrangement designed to ease the transition between full-time employment and retirement with flexible hours, reduced workloads, and phased approaches to leaving the workforce. This bridge offers a lower-stress transition by easing into retirement by working 10, 20, or 30 hours instead of 40, allows flextirees to adjust to an income shift, explore hobbies, and spend more time with loved ones, all while gradually letting go of work. For most of our flextirees, working part-time is a privilege. For others, it may be a financial necessity. According to a Bankrate survey, 56% of workers in the U.S. believe they\u2019re behind on their retirement savings. For business owners like myself, there are many advantages. Seasoned employees, when transitioning to a flextirement role, can become invaluable mentors for younger colleagues. Plus, as we know well, as an outsourced HR company, finding and training replacements for senior employees can be expensive. Flextirement provides a cost-effective way to attract experienced employees and retain them\u2014and their institutional knowledge. I\u2019ve always advocated for a very flexible work environment, and Optima Office offered flextirement from day one. We need highly skilled resources such as CFOs, and I\u2019ve found an incredible talent pool that is near retirement or coming out of retirement to work part-time. It\u2019s important to note, however, that we don\u2019t just give our employees nearing retirement a flexible place to work; we let people of all ages work the hours that make sense for them. In fact, there are only a dozen of our 100 employees who work more than 40 hours a week, and that is by choice.\u00a0 Flextirement has had an incredibly positive impact for our team at Optima Office. These seasoned veterans, the ones with decades of experience under their belts, didn\u2019t have to completely step away. They craved a balance\u2014the intellectual stimulation of their careers without the full-time commitment. And for us as a company, the benefits were undeniable, reaping the value of their experience and know-how. Today, 12 of our employees are on a flextirement plan. They work anywhere from 12 to 25 hours a week, mentor junior employees, and contribute to specific projects where their expertise shines. They are able to make their own schedule and spend time with grandkids, but also give their many years of expertise to the companies who need them. Beyond technical expertise, our flextirees bring a wealth of soft skills honed over decades of experience. They understand team dynamics, the art of negotiation, and the importance of clear communication. These are invaluable lessons for our younger workforce. Our flextirees are demonstrably happier and more engaged. They have the time for their personal lives, hobbies, and families, yet they remain connected to the work they love. This, in turn, fosters a company culture that prioritizes well-being and work-life balance. And, as I mentioned, it isn\u2019t just boomers that get this benefit; I\u2019ve always let our team work part-time if that is what fits their lifestyle, so there is no resentment from younger employees.\u00a0 To implement this, you could start by offering part-time roles to the older generation\u2014start in areas you need them most! It could even be in positions such as assistant work or administrative. Or it could be in highly skilled areas such as the C Suite. Be open-minded when speaking with candidates. Outside of flextirement, consider how many parents want a more gradual transition back from maternity\/paternity leave or want to work part-time while their children are young. As a mom of a toddler, I have learned this firsthand and have since also made it an official policy at Optima Office policies to provide additional flexibility to parents so they know they have our support to adjust their work schedule in different stages of their parenting journey. Many of our baby-boomer flextirees\u2014now working part-time in order to take on a more active role in their grandchildren\u2019s lives\u2014wish they had this arrangement when they were new parents as well.\u00a0 As the baby-boomer generation continues to redefine retirement, flextirement is poised to become more commonplace. Companies that embrace this model will reap the benefits of a wealth of experience, knowledge transfer, and a happier, more engaged workforce. Here at Optima Office, we\u2019re not just weathering the storm of a changing workforce; we\u2019re riding the wave. Flextirement isn\u2019t a concession, it\u2019s a nontraditional approach to retirement with advantages for companies and their employees.\u00a0 As more companies embrace this innovative approach, the traditional retirement cliff might just become a gentle, flexible slope where everyone can find their own comfortable landing point.

They also approved Tesla\u2019s bid to move its corporate headquarters from Delaware to Texas, which Musk announced shortly after the February verdict. Musk took a victory lap on stage in Austin immediately after the results were announced, telling those gathered, \u201cWe\u2019re not just opening up a new chapter\u2014we\u2019re starting a new book.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the best book,\u201d he said later in the sometimes-rambling speech. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be next-level.\u201d Tesla previously said said in a regulatory filing that stockholders were set to approve Musk\u2019s pay, valued around $44.9 billion, by a wide margin. The company sought the votes after a Delaware judge threw out the pay package in January. Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick determined that Tesla deceived shareholders when the all stock compensation was approved in 2018, so Musk is not entitled to the landmark package, which was worth nearly $56 billion before a stock slide this year. Shares of Tesla closed Thursday up just under 3% at $182.47. The stock is down about 25% this year. The approval of his pay almost guarantees that Musk will remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla\u2019s future. Musk has threatened on X to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn\u2019t get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk\u2019s xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. According to Musk, early indications suggest that shareholders also back a move to relocate Tesla\u2019s legal home to Texas, and out of Delaware. The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court\u2019s oversight and possibly from McCormick\u2019s ruling. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark pay package. Multiple institutional investors had come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla\u2019s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don\u2019t announce their votes or wouldn\u2019t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California\u2019s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk\u2019s pay \u201cbased on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.\u201d In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. \u201cBecause the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us \u2014 and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard \u2014 as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,\u201d she wrote. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk\u2019s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won\u2019t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week\u2019s shareholder vote, they wrote. In an order denying Tornetta\u2019s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla\u2019s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. \u201cThe defendants\u2019 statements give me great comfort,\u201d she wrote. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said he expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick\u2019s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The sector is still reeling from the pandemic, which pushed more professionals to work from home and consumers to shop and dine at home. As a result, office vacancy rates reached a 30-year high around 18% in 2023, and companies both large and small majorly shed space to adjust to new remote- and hybrid-working norms. Some even terminated their leases early. Now, commercial real estate bargain hunters are snagging space for steep discounts up to 70% off, according to several reports from commercial real estate information company CoStar. \u201cThere has certainly been a trend of commercial buildings being scooped up at extreme discounts,\u201d David Almaraz, a real estate attorney at Grant Shenon in Los Angeles with more than 20 years of experience, tells Fortune. \u201cIn the current state, commercial real estate is in trouble. People don\u2019t want to go into the office anymore, and the days of putting on a suit and tie and commuting 40 minutes to sit in a cubicle doesn\u2019t appeal to the average worker anymore.\u201d Some examples of heavily discounted commercial real estate sales include an office building in downtown San Jose, which sold for about $56 million less than what it did in 2017, according to CoStar, and a Manhattan office building that sold at a roughly 67% discount, a Bloomberg report shows. Empire Capital Holdings and Namdar Realty Group purchased the property for less than $50 million, according to Bloomberg, but Related Fund Management paid a whopping $153 million for it in 2018.\u00a0 While commercial real estate as a whole is struggling, most of these steep discounts have been seen in the office sector. \u201cOffice is clearly in the worst shape versus the other property types,\u201d Joe Iacono, CEO of commercial real estate finance firm Crescit Capital Strategies, tells Fortune. \u201cOther asset classes are suffering from higher interest rates, expense inflation\u2014in particular insurance and wages\u2014and a flattening of rent growth. Office has to contend with all these factors plus significant vacancy and lack of demand.\u201d The steep discounts offered on commercial properties is just the latest sign of a struggling sector. Another one of the most damning figures that illustrates the doom headed for commercial real estate is the total value of mortgages that will mature in 2024. By Mortgage Bankers Association projections, $929 billion of the $4.7 trillion outstanding commercial mortgages held by lenders and investors will come due this year, according to a report released in February. This will be troublesome for tenants looking to refinance at a higher interest-rate environment. While many commercial properties have lost value during the past few years, not all are being offered at the steep 60% to 70% discounts mentioned previously. Moody\u2019s looked at various price indices that measure changes on repeat sales of the same properties over time and found that office values have come down about 20% to 30% since their 2021 peak. However, other measures imply a 30% to 40% discount, Moody\u2019s head of commercial real estate economic analysis, Kevin Fagan, tells Fortune.\u00a0 \u201cSome office properties are seeing significant discounts to their prior valuations or sale prices, but 70% is not the norm,\u201d Fagan says. \u201cWhile sale volume is low and price discovery has been a big challenge for CRE stakeholders over the past year or two, the sales that have occurred have offered a very mixed picture.\u201d Indeed, other measures based on market prices of public REITs indicate as much as a 60% peak-to-trough decline, he adds. It\u2019s also important to note the intricacies of individual commercial real estate sales, especially when it comes to properties that are massively discounted. Take the example of the Manhattan office building at 1740 Broadway. There had been a \u201cbattle\u201d between bondholders and the special servicer (who specialize in managing and resolving distressed loans) on the deal after Blacksone turned over the keys to the property, Fagan says, which resulted in delays and a need to get the property sold quickly.\u00a0 \u201cAll of those issues led to a fire sale situation on the asset, versus an orderly sale that would maximize recovery value,\u201d Fagan says. Another such example was a property in Fort Worth, Texas, where multiple reports in May indicated that the Burnett Plaza building had sold for $12.3 million, less than one-tenth of the $137.5 million paid just three years earlier.\u00a0 \u201cThe reality of the situation was much different,\u201d Fagan explains, because the media reports only addressed part of the sale. The foreclosure auction was only for the mezzanine loan on the property, which are typically just used for acquisitions or development projects. The first mortgage on the building, which is estimated at $83 million, is still in place for the building.\u00a0 \u201cSo while the winning bid was $12.3 million, the buyer is also responsible for the $83 million first mortgage, bringing the acquisition to just over $95 million,\u201d Fagan says. \u201cThis is still a steep decline from $137.5 million in just three years, but 33% is a long way from the 90%-plus [discount] that was widely reported.\u201d Either way, it\u2019s undeniable that many commercial property owners are having a tough time keeping their buildings occupied.\u00a0 \u201cBuilding owners face significant headwinds attracting and retaining tenants, especially in the office category,\u201d Kevan Ventura, a principal in law firm Goldberg Kohn\u2018s real estate group, tells Fortune. \u201cSimply put, reduced tenant demand contributes to reduced rental income and reduced value. Maintaining occupancy is critical to financial viability.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Amid a decline in traditional banking services, whoever monopolizes the wallet market stands to wield significant power in the financial sector, she says. In conversation with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong at the company\u2019s State of Crypto Summit on Thursday, Wood argued that there is a new generation of consumers who want a digital wallet to be their one-stop shop for all online payments. Citing the absence of traditional banks in the digital wallet space, \u201cthis truly is a winner-take-most opportunity,\u201d she said. Wood made repeated reference to WeChat Pay\u2014the digital wallet from Chinese social media giant WeChat, which lets users make mobile payments and online transactions\u2014noting it has set the \u201cmodel\u201d for how the market will evolve.\u00a0WeChat Pay functions like a \u201cbank branch in your pocket,\u201d she said, offering all forms of financial services and commerce. Since its initial release in 2013, the app has accumulated over 1.13 billion active users. Along with Alibaba\u2019s Alipay, the two applications account for over 90% of all mobile payments in China. Digital wallets can be loosely described as phone applications that enable peer-to-peer transactions, real-world purchases, and online payments. Major players include PayPal, its subsidiary Venmo, Zelle, and Cash App, which are all digitally native with no brick-and-mortar branches.\u00a0 But the services offered by these fintech companies are fast usurping traditional banking. According to Worldpay\u2019s Global Payments 2024 report, digital wallets accounted for half of all e-commerce transaction value last year. Citing a generation coming of age that may never see the four walls of a traditional bank, Armstrong said he wants crypto to be treated as a serious contender in the digital wallet race. Like Wood, he predicted that one\u2019s phone will exist interchangeably with one\u2019s wallet, and consumer demand for a single financial account \u201cwhere they get paid, make purchases, and send money,\u201d will become the norm. Despite Coinbase\u2019s reputation as an exchange first and foremost, Armstrong noted \u201cthe real potential in innovation [in crypto], comes from these peer-to-peer transactions.\u201d Crypto\u2019s presence in the digital wallet space is growing. In April, PayPal announced users can make fee-free global transfers of its stablecoin PYUSD, while Cash App has let users buy and sell Bitcoin since 2018. Last week, Coinbase debuted its Smart Wallet, a self-custodial crypto wallet that replaces the laborious recovery phrases, apps, and extensions typically associated with accessing DeFi wallets that keeps some users away, with biometric data, such as Face ID and fingerprints. On top of this, the Smart Wallet can draw funds from both the user\u2019s self-custodial wallet and their Coinbase account balance. In a competitive, saturated digital wallet market, Armstrong touted \u201cinteroperability\u201d as DeFi\u2019s comparative advantage. In other words, a Coinbase wallet transaction doesn\u2019t need to be met with another Coinbase wallet, unlike, say, PayPal. The CEO likened payments to flowing water\u2014it follows the path of least resistance. In lieu of that, he predicted that a quarter of global GDP will be on crypto rails\u2014the term for payment platforms that support the transfer of digital assets\u2014within a decade.\u00a0Armstrong concluded with an ambitious, final goal: for Coinbase wallets to be the \u201cprimary financial account\u201d for the next generation. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The results have not been officially released yet, but findings so far reveal for the third year in a row that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that reducing the pay gap between CEOs and average workers is not only an important issue, but also one that corporate boards are failing miserably to address.\u00a0 \u201cCEO pay is an outrage. It\u2019s atrocious. And it hugely undermines confidence in our institutions,\u201d Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told CNN, which was first to report on the survey findings. In 2023, the average CEO of an S&P 500 company earned 196 times as much as typical employees, up from 185 in 2022. Some 83% of Americans told pollsters that it was either somewhat or extremely important that businesses try to reduce the yawning chasm between average pay for top executives and pay for median employees. At the same time, just 13% of respondents said companies were doing a fair job of keeping CEO pay under control.\u00a0 But if public opinion on CEO pay appears overwhelming\u2014and consistent, both year-over-year and across demographics\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem to be having much of an impact.\u00a0 Median compensation packages for S&P 500 CEOs rose nearly 13% last year, even as pay and benefits for private sector workers rose just over 4%, according to the AP\u2019s annual compensation survey. The results of the survey, analyzed for the AP by Equilar, showed that the average pay for CEOs rose to $16.3 million including cash and stock-based awards, while the median employee at an S&P 500 company earned $81,467.\u00a0 \u201cInstinctively, it doesn\u2019t seem fair. How can a CEO make 196 times the average worker?\u201d Cynthia Clark, a professor of management at Bentley University, told CNN. The new findings also showed that political party affiliation wasn\u2019t a major factor in how Americans viewed the pay gap between CEOs and employees. In the survey, 96% of Democrats said reducing the pay gap was important. Republicans, while not as ardent, still overwhelmingly said the issue was important (66%). CEO pay is \u201can issue that cuts across the political spectrum,\u201d Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, told Fortune. In fact, she said it might even be a factor behind the resurgence in organized labor activity in 2023, as dissatisfaction with company profits getting funneled to the top of the pay scale boiled over at major unions like United Auto Workers. \u201cComing out of the pandemic, the idea that one person in a corner office is worth hundreds of times more than frontline workers, many of whom were doing essential work to keep our economy going\u2014people just aren\u2019t buying that anymore,\u201d Anderson told Fortune. The Gallup-Bentley findings aren\u2019t the first polling this year that has shown bipartisan contempt for CEO pay.\u00a0 A poll in April by Data for Progress asked respondents how they would feel about implementing legislation that hiked taxes on companies that pay their CEOs at least 50 times the median pay of employees. The results showed overwhelming approval from both Republicans and Democrats.\u00a0 Bills like the one surfaced by pollsters have been floated before in both chambers of Congress, including one introduced this year by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act.\u00a0 But Anderson said that kind of legislation has stalled because corporate lobbyists continue to pound the table that CEOs of big corporations are almost singehandly responsible for shareholder value. The talent pool for top executives is incredibly competitive, and if they don\u2019t pay up, CEOs will go off to other companies that will. \u201cI think most Americans really see through that argument now, and understand that employees up and down the pay scale are contributing value to these companies,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt says a lot about who really has a strong voice in Washington. Those corporate lobby groups who are still pushing that outmoded idea still have a lot of say.\u201d This all comes as Tesla shareholders today approved the largest pay package in history for CEO Elon Musk at $56 billion.\u00a0 \u201cShareholders are the group that ought to decide pay packages,\u201d Bentley professor Cynthia Clark told Fortune in an email. \u201cThe big concern with Musk\u2019s award is not what he will do if he doesn\u2019t get it, much covered in the news, but what will happen with other CEO\u2019s and the pay ratios if he does.\u201d Anderson told Fortune that Musk\u2019s pay package offered an interesting look at other mechanisms for reigning in CEO pay. In January, a Delaware judge vetoed Musk\u2019s payout due to corporate governance issues, and several major institutional investors, including two of California\u2019s public pension plans, came out against the deal ahead of today\u2019s vote. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see some major institutional investors take a stand against this obscene pay package that was approved by his brother and his divorce lawyer, and these other people who have such cozy ties with the executives,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut there is a really high hurdle to getting majority votes against pay packages at companies.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The latest evidence: Significantly more Gen Zers and millennials are investing outside the workplace. The percentage of households headed by a twentysomething investing in a Roth IRA almost tripled from 2016 to 2022\u20146.6% to 19.2%\u2014according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve analyzed by Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research (CRR). No similar growth was seen in households headed by older age groups or in 401(k) participation. The growth in Roth IRA usage was concentrated among the top-third-highest earners, according to CRR analysis, which the organization credits to fintech platforms like Robinhood making it easier in recent years to access financial instruments. Also at play: Many young households, particularly wealthy ones, were able to invest a lot of money during the pandemic, at least relative to what they had before. Previous research from the Federal Reserve found the inflation-adjusted wealth for Americans under age 40 grew by an astounding 80% between Q1 2019 and Q3 2023, primarily the result of stock investments. \u201cDuring the pandemic, people had more time on their hands, stimulus checks, and took an opportunity on the market decline,\u201d says Evan Potash, executive wealth management advisor at TIAA. \u201cThis is complemented by the fact that younger people starting out in their careers, who tend to make less than those further on in their career cycle, haven\u2019t phased out yet for Roth IRA contributions.\u201d While this is good news for higher earners, those at the other end of the income spectrum aren\u2019t faring quite as well. CRR research found just 4% of households headed by a twentysomething in the bottom third of income distribution to be investing in a Roth in 2022. That\u2019s still up from 2% in 2016, but it\u2019s significantly less than the 41% of those in the top third. \u201cThe bottom line seems to be that if technology makes it really easy to save in tax-advantaged accounts, the tech-savvy with money will take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d Alicia Munnell, director of CRR, wrote. Other studies have also found that the wealth gap between the poorest and richest young people is growing. According to research published by the University of Chicago Press, the richest 10% of millennials have 20% more wealth than the richest boomers did. Meanwhile, those on the other end of the income spectrum have seen their wealth stagnate, at best, or decline at worst. Though 401(k)s get a lot of the love from the financial press and advisors, Americans hold far more of their total retirement assets in individual accounts. More younger investors getting in the game earlier could help them grow their wealth significantly over time because of compounding returns. And a Roth IRA is one of the best ways for young people especially to start investing, experts say. Because of the way it\u2019s structured\u2014investors contribute money that\u2019s already been taxed, and the investments then grow tax-free until retirement; it\u2019s a good deal for those in lower tax brackets who don\u2019t need the tax break provided by a traditional IRA or 401(k) now. Generally speaking, employees earn less when they\u2019re young compared with when they\u2019re older. Additionally, Roth IRAs are an especially good deal now given how low federal income taxes are, although that may change in the next few years. \u201cThe sooner you start saving in a Roth IRA, the more time you have for growth,\u201d adds Potash of TIAA. Although the growth in IRA investments is concentrated among top earners, it\u2019s yet another indicator that young people are serious about investing\u2014and are doing so earlier than previous generations. Prior research has found the average Gen Zer started putting money away for retirement at age 22\u201415 years earlier than the average baby boomer. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Wade\u00a0two years ago. The nine justices ruled\u00a0that\u00a0abortion\u00a0opponents lacked the legal right to sue over the federal Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the medication,\u00a0mifepristone, and the FDA\u2019s subsequent actions to ease access to it. The case had threatened to restrict access to mifepristone across the country, including in states where abortion remains legal. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the majority to overturn Roe, wrote for the court on Thursday that \u201cfederal courts are the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 concerns about FDA\u2019s actions.\u201d The decision could lessen the intensity of the abortion issue in the November elections, with Democrats already energized and voting against restrictions on reproductive rights. But the high court is separately considering another abortion case, about whether\u00a0a federal law on emergency treatment\u00a0at hospitals overrides state abortion bans in rare emergency cases in which a pregnant patient\u2019s health is at serious risk. More than 6 million people have used mifepristone since 2000. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of a second drug, misoprostol.\u00a0The two-drug regimen\u00a0has been used to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks gestation. Health care providers have said that if mifepristone is no longer available or is too hard to obtain, they would switch to using only misoprostol, which is somewhat less effective in ending pregnancies. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and drug manufacturers had warned that siding with abortion opponents in this case could undermine the FDA\u2019s drug approval process beyond the abortion context by inviting judges to second-guess the agency\u2019s scientific judgments. The Democratic administration and New York-based Danco Laboratories, which makes mifepristone, argued that\u00a0the drug is among the safest\u00a0the FDA has ever approved. The decision \u201csafeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use,\u201d Danco spokeswoman Abigail Long said in a statement. The plaintiffs in the mifepristone case, anti-abortion doctors and their organizations, argued in court papers that the FDA\u2019s decisions in 2016 and 2021 to relax restrictions on getting the drug were unreasonable and \u201cjeopardize women\u2019s health across the nation.\u201d Kavanaugh acknowledged what he described as the opponents\u2019 \u201csincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone.\u201d Federal laws already protect doctors from having to perform abortions, or give any other treatment that goes against their beliefs, Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cThe plaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor\u2019s conscience since mifepristone\u2019s 2000 approval,\u201d he wrote. In the end, Kavanaugh wrote, the anti-abortion doctors went to the wrong forum and should instead direct their energies to persuading lawmakers and regulators to make changes. Those comments pointed to the stakes of\u00a0the 2024 election\u00a0and the possibility that an FDA commissioner appointed by Republican Donald Trump, if he wins the White House, could consider tightening access to mifepristone. The mifepristone case began five months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Abortion opponents initially won a sweeping ruling nearly a year ago from\u00a0U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee in Texas, which would have revoked the drug\u2019s approval entirely. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left intact the FDA\u2019s initial approval of mifepristone. But it would reverse changes regulators made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for administering the drug. The Supreme Court put the appeals court\u2019s modified ruling on hold, then agreed to hear the case, though Justices Samuel Alito, the author of the decision overturning Roe, and Clarence Thomas would have allowed some restrictions to take effect while the case proceeded. But they, too, joined the court\u2019s opinion Thursday. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The justices tightened the standards for when a federal court should issue an order to protect the jobs of workers during a union organizing campaign. The court rejected a rule that some courts had applied to orders sought by the National Labor Relations Board in favor of a higher threshold, sought by Starbucks, that must be met in most other fights over court orders, or injunctions. The NLRB had argued that the National Labor Relations Act, the law that governs the agency, has for more than 75 years allowed courts to grant temporary injunctions if they find requests \u201cjust and proper.\u201d The agency said the law doesn\u2019t require it to prove other factors and was intended to limit the role of the courts. The case began in February 2022, when Starbucks\u00a0fired seven workers\u00a0who were trying to unionize their Tennessee store. The NLRB obtained a court order forcing the company to rehire the workers while the case wound its way through\u00a0the agency\u2019s administrative proceedings. Such proceedings can take up to two years. A district court judge agreed with the NLRB and issued a temporary injunction ordering Starbucks to rehire the workers in August 2022. After the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling, Starbucks appealed to the Supreme Court. Five of the seven workers are still employed at the Memphis store, while the other two remain involved with the organizing effort, according to Workers United, the union organizing Starbucks workers. The Memphis store\u00a0voted to unionize\u00a0in June 2022. As as the case proceeded, animosity between\u00a0Workers United\u00a0and Starbucks\u00a0began to fade. The two sides announced in February that they would restart talks with the aim of\u00a0reaching contract agreements\u00a0this year, and they held their first bargaining session in nearly a year in late April. Workers at 437 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021, according to the NLRB, but\u00a0none of those stores\u00a0has secured a labor agreement with Starbucks. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Put on by the World Chess Federation, or F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE), the finals in New York City this weekend will pit some of the best players from Google, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs against nine other companies from the U.S. and abroad to crown \u201cthe smartest company in the world.\u201d The FIDE World Corporate Chess Championship will kick off with each team of four, plus an alternate, competing in a 10-round group stage on June 15 and 16 until the top four teams pass to the semifinal. The final two teams will battle it out on June 17 for the title.\u00a0 The tournament is meant to highlight how the strategic mindset required for chess intersects with decision-making in the corporate world, FIDE press officer Milan Dinic told Fortune. \u201cChess and business share many overlapping concepts such as strategy, risk management, and resource management,\u201d Dinic said in an email. \u201cThe idea behind the championship is to explore and deepen the connections between chess and the business world.\u201d  Those connections are clear to Igor Shneider, a vice president at Deutsche Bank in the Financial Institutions Group and a FIDE Master (FM) on the bank\u2019s chess team. \u201cDeutsche Bank has always been supportive of us playing in these types of competitions as they appreciate the strategic nature of the game,\u201d Shneider told Fortune in an email. \u201cChess cultivates more strategic thinking and collaboration across the organization, which Deutsche Bank and clients appreciate.\u201d Although many newcomers started playing the game during the pandemic following the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Shneider said chess has always played a special role in his life. Growing up, he traveled internationally to represent the U.S. in tournaments and said he views chess as \u201cthe great equalizer,\u201d that can bring together people from different backgrounds. But this weekend, Deutsche Bank\u2019s team of former competitive players, including three chess masters and a former U.S. Woman\u2019s Chess Champion, have their eyes on the prize. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to represent Deutsche Bank in this competition, and it would be really special if we could become World Champions,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Google\u2019s team captain Kola Adeyemi is a product strategy and operations lead for Google Workspace who learned the game from his uncle as an eight-year-old growing up in Lagos, Nigeria. Although he\u2019s a competitive player rated about 2000 by the international FIDE standards\u2014his rating of 2336 under classical time controls makes him a National Master, according to the U.S. Chess Federation\u2014he still enjoys playing with the cutthroat locals at Bryant Park in New York City. Adeyimi said Google has an active chess community with about 2,500 people on its email list. Google employees worldwide often play each other in online tournaments, he said. A few of them are even Grandmasters (GM) and International Masters (IM), which by FIDE standards puts them among the best players in the world, he added.\u00a0 Google\u2019s team members will surely give it their all in the tournament this weekend, Adeyemi said, but the question of whether tech or finance people are smarter is far from top of mind. \u201cPeople are not playing this because they\u2019re getting some kind of prize money or things like that, they\u2019re playing this just because they love the game,\u201d he told Fortune. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

And they were comfortable paying well over ask.\u201d \u201cThey sell a high-margin product and don\u2019t pay sales tax on it,\u201d said Steven Soutendijk, a commercial broker at Cushman and Wakefield. That\u2019s why, even despite hefty fines, many dispensaries were able to continue operating in Manhattan\u2019s most expensive corridors. \u201cAnd they were able to convince landlords that they were just smoke shops\u2014that they weren\u2019t selling marijuana or cannabis,\u201d he added. New York\u2019s crackdown comes after years of fits and starts. The state legalized recreational marijuana in 2021, but it struggled with the rollout of licensed businesses, while a proliferation of smoke shops selling the product illegally abounded, leading the preeminent advocate of legalization to lament the \u201cWild West\u201d the retail market had become. In 2023, new state legislation gave the Office of Cannabis Management new latitude to conduct inspections and issue fines of illegal sellers, but it didn\u2019t move the needle. For some shops, like the one at 738 Broadway, business was so profitable that \u201cthey were comfortably paying these fines so they could continue operating,\u201d Langer said. It wasn\u2019t until April of this year that the state passed regulations enabling local officials to immediately padlock unlicensed weed sellers, leading mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to kick off \u201cOperation Padlock to Protect\u201d at the start of May. Since then, more than 3,000 shops have been swept up, according to a recent article by the Commercial Observer.\u00a0 Losing those high-paying unlicensed dispensary tenants was by no means \u201ca win for landlords,\u201d Langer said, but it wasn\u2019t a loss, either. The flourishing of smoke shops over the past few years is just the latest swing in the eternal boom-bust cycle of retail. In the early 2010s, it was frozen yogurt. In the late 2010s poke bowls were all the rage, and more recently, Smashburger have taken over. Regardless, the boom-and-bust nature of the cycle always replaces the last craze with something new.\u00a0 \u201cThe last trend happened to be illegal smoke shops, but there will be another one, and there\u2019s going to be another tenant who\u2019s going to be willing to pay top dollar in rent,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Retail space in New York City\u2014and Manhattan in particular\u2014is notoriously some of the most expensive in the world. The average cost of renting retail space in Manhattan is over $100 per square foot, according to PropertyShark, while the average cost in Boston is just $16. A report from Cushman and Wakefield listed upper Fifth Avenue as the most expensive retail area in the world, with asking prices around $2,000 per square foot\u2014nearly $250 more than Milan\u2019s luxury-shopping mecca Via Monte Napoeone, the runner-up. Soutendijk agreed that the turnover from dispensaries wouldn\u2019t upend the city\u2019s retail market, although former smoke shops landlords might have to settle for slightly less in rent.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about 50% of the rent,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re talking about 10% less rent, or 15% less rent, and that comes with the territory of being a landlord.\u201d Across the board, commercial real estate in the city has struggled post-pandemic, heightening concerns about an economic \u201cdoom loop\u201d in which once-bustling downtowns stay empty as suburbanites work from home and starve the businesses that used to depend on their foot traffic. Offices in the city\u2019s major business districts\u2014Brooklyn, midtown, downtown, and midtown south\u2013had vacancy rates between 22 and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to a report from Cushman and Wakefield. By comparison, Boston had a vacancy rate of 15.1%. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul cited the city\u2019s commercial vacancy rate as proof of its unsteady recovery in her surprise decision to scrap the state\u2019s congestion pricing plan last week.\u00a0 Just over 11% of storefronts in New York City were vacant this year, according to data from the city\u2019s finance department. While that\u2019s slightly down compared to last year, it\u2019s still nearly double the 6% vacancy rate in 2019.\u00a0 But Soutendijk said that, as far as retail vacancies went, there was no cause for panic.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s say that it is 11%,\u201d said Soutendijk, who estimated the true vacancy rate at between 10% and 12%. \u201cRight now, 11% is a very healthy availability rate, and it represents an incredibly strong retail market.\u201d Mayor Adams had initially said the city would be able to close all of its unlicensed dispensaries within a month of getting the authority from the state, but has since walked back his timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that\u2019s going to take months, if not a year plus, and it\u2019s going to happen in sort of a staggered way, and it\u2019s going to happen across the five boroughs,\u201d Soutendijk told Fortune. \u201cThey\u2019re geographically dispersed all over New York. We\u2019re not going to have this sudden rush of available retail space all at once.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not even remotely concerned about this, as someone who relies on [real estate] for their livelihood,\u201d Soutendijk said.\u00a0 In addition to their ideal locations, he told Fortune that most of the spaces renting to smoke shops are small, meaning a greater variety of prospective tenants could take their place. And the exit of unlicensed dispensaries would give legally operating retailers an opportunity.\u00a0 \u201cThis is going to cause a temporary, very small blip in retail availability rates, and I\u2019m so confident that almost all these spaces are going to get backfilled pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully by some new creative, legal uses that take advantage of the fact that landlords are going to be feeling like, \u2018Oh God, I\u2019ve got to find a source of income for these spaces now.\u2019\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

He leads a global campaign for financial literacy launched at the World Economic Forum in 2023, following the passing of his brother-in-law Lenny Borger, with the audacious goal of positively impacting 1 billion lives. In an era of rapid change and unprecedented challenges, the pursuit of human flourishing has become a shared aspiration worldwide. Now in its second year, the Harvard Human Flourishing Program is a landmark five-year study that investigates the factors influencing human flourishing across 22 countries, involving around 240,000 participants over five years. This groundbreaking initiative seeks to explore and understand the fundamental elements that lead to a life well-lived, with a particular focus on the significance of financial well-being. Over five transformative years, the program delves deep into the complexities of human life, examining not only the traditional markers of success but also the intangible components that contribute to overall well-being. The findings so far have been nothing short of revolutionary, uncovering a profound truth: The undeniable connection between financial well-being and the ability to lead a flourishing life. The intersection of financial health and mental well-being is rich with implications for policy, personal finance education, and societal health. The synthesis of key findings from these papers highlights the profound and nuanced role that financial conditions play in influencing both physical and mental health outcomes. The papers collectively emphasize the protective roles of financial safety, security, and capability against mental health challenges, while also presenting financial distress and debt as significant risk factors for depression and anxiety. Here\u2019s what can we learn from the highlighted findings: The perception of financial safety and the ability to make sound financial decisions emerge as a critical shield against mental health issues. This underscores the psychological dimension of financial health, where the subjective feeling of financial security can significantly impact mental well-being. Debt is not just a financial burden but also a mental one, with a direct correlation to increased risks of depression. This emphasizes the need for strategies to manage or mitigate debt as a part of mental health interventions. The ability to manage monthly expenses and engage in financial planning is associated with reduced odds of depression and anxiety. This links financial literacy and capability directly to health outcomes, suggesting that improving financial skills is a pathway to better health. The findings call for policy interventions that ensure income security, protect against income shocks and provide equitable access to health insurance. The stark differences in health effects of financial distress between countries with strong and weak welfare systems point to the critical role of social safety nets. Financial literacy is not just about promoting savings but also fostering a comprehensive understanding of financial management, which can lead to healthier financial behaviors and, by extension, improved mental and physical health. The concept of financial control\u2014having the knowledge and skills to manage one\u2019s finances effectively\u2014is highlighted as a significant factor in promoting emotional and physical well-being. As reported in the forthcoming research by FinFit in collaboration with HR Dive, 55% of employees state they are looking for access to long-term financial planning. This extends the conversation to the importance of financial education and the empowerment of individuals through financial knowledge. Addressing financial distress requires a holistic approach. It necessitates a deeper understanding of financial behaviors, tools, and interventions at the moments that matter in your life, alongside the promotion of financial skills and capability for long-term well-being. Research into credit sources and life satisfaction hints at the importance of understanding the complex roles different types of credit play in life satisfaction and well-being, further highlighting the relationship between financial health and overall well-being. These early findings call for a holistic approach to financial education, policymaking, and mental health support that acknowledges the profound impact of financial conditions on an individual\u2019s life. We must reconsider how society addresses financial education, mental health, and the societal structures that support or undermine financial and emotional well-being.

The IEA anticipates the oil supply hitting 114 million barrels a day by the end of the decade\u2014roughly 8 million barrels a day higher than demand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis would result in levels of spare capacity never seen before other than at the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020,\u201d the IEA said.\u00a0 \u201cSuch a massive oil production buffer could usher in a lower oil price environment, posing tough challenges for producers in the US shale patch and the OPEC+ bloc.\u201d Although supply will outstrip demand in the next couple of years, oil demand will still be slightly higher in 2030 compared to current levels, thanks to a strong appetite from Asian markets like India and China.\u00a0 \u201cBy contrast, oil demand in advanced economies is expected to continue its decades-long decline,\u201d the report said, adding that the only other exception to when demand was as low was in 1991 when major events like the Gulf War and the Soviet Union\u2019s dissolution took place. Advanced economies will see oil demand decline by 3 million barrels a day from now to 2030.\u00a0\u00a0 Even economies with relatively higher oil consumption will have to contend with the growing presence of electric vehicles and energy-efficiency methods that aim to cut or offset carbon emissions. The IEA predicted last year that fossil fuels were at \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d as a shift in the energy industry was underway. The energy agency warned that demand forecasts in its latest report were subject to economic volatility, changes in the pace of EV adoption, and more.\u00a0 Pricing oil also varies a lot\u2014earlier this week, both oil indexes, Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate, rose amid reports that oil production would climb later this year. Summer is expected to bring greater oil demand, although uncertainties, such as with interest rates, still figure into how the commodity is priced.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, overall, deceleration in demand will dominate what happens to the oil industry in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The gap in demand and supply will impact the stronghold of the OPEC+ alliance, which comprises the world\u2019s major oil producers and its allies. The group, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has watched over oil output for years as a way to temper prices. Higher oil prices are more lucrative for economies, including Russia, that rely on oil exports to fill their coffers.\u00a0 Shrinking demand will create a \u201cmassive cushion\u201d and shake up how OPEC+ approaches its strategy on oil production moving forward, the IEA said. That\u2019ll also mean the group\u2019s share of oil output will slip below 50% from this year onwards, paving the way for other non-OPEC+ members such as Brazil and Norway. OPEC\u2019s general secretary isn\u2019t so sure that things are on the decline. The IEA\u2019s forecast was \u201cdangerous,\u201d Haitham al-Ghais told the Financial Times Wednesday, and added that if investors stopped pumping money into the oil and gas industry, the resulting \u201cenergy chaos\u201d would be \u201con a potentially unprecedented scale.\u201d Still, it looks like the sun is indeed setting for fossil fuels\u2014sooner rather than later.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The main purposes of the research, Phalippou said in an interview with the Financial Times, is to show the colossal wealth created by the high fees of private funds, divulge the potential tax revenue governments could collect from these firms if such fees were treated as income tax rather than capital gains, and to reveal whether private investment strategies are worth what they cost.\u00a0 \u201cIt shows you the upper bound of what you could collect if all of the countries in the world coordinated to tax that pot,\u201d Phalippou said in the interview, adding, \u201conce you understand how much money we are talking about, you can understand why private equity is the largest donor to politicians and universities.\u201d\u00a0 Senior employees of private equity advisory firms earn salaries that are subject to standard income taxes, the report states, but they also receive payments \u201cconditional on the performance of the funds they advise: the carried interest.\u201d\u00a0 Most tax laws, he writes in the report, consider carried interest to be a capital gain, and is taxed at a much lower rate than income tax rates. These payments often resemble a performance-related bonus payment, but it comes with an exception that \u201cemployees should personally invest in the fund under management to be eligible for this bonus.\u201d It\u2019s a stark difference from how publicly traded firms operate, where as much as half of these fees are paid to shareholders in the form of dividends, the Financial Times reported.\u00a0 The restructured payments have been dubbed a \u201cloophole\u201d by politicians\u2014and the method has been drawing political scrutiny across the U.S and Europe for years, with the U.K.\u2019s Labour party one of its most vocal critics.\u00a0 Rachel Reeves\u2014the country\u2019s shadow chancellor and a member of the Labour party, which is widely expected to win this year\u2019s elections\u2014has vowed to move forward with plans to impose higher taxes on top private equity bosses. In its election manifesto published Thursday, the party pledged to consult on closing the carried interest tax loophole, which currently allows private equity bosses to pay tax at 28% capital gains rate, rather than the higher top marginal rate of income tax at 45%.\u00a0 Reiterating this promise is the party\u2019s latest push in a years-long effort to close the tax loophole, which Reeves has estimated could raise up to \u00a3440 million for the U.K government. Critics of the Labour party\u2019s plan cite concerns that higher tax rates will give investment groups more reason to leave London, saying that foreign capital can help address needs that Britain\u2019s stretched public finances cannot fund on their own, like infrastructure, green energy, and more affordable housing.\u00a0 In the U.S., several politicians including President Joe Biden and even former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump all made vows to end the special tax structure, but all those plans cracked under pressure from industry lobbyists.\u00a0 The savings some top private equity bosses amass are sizable: Phalippou\u2019s research calculates that Blackstone Group, the world\u2019s largest private equity investor, earned $33.6 billion in carried interest\u2014a sum that is over $10 billion larger than any other single investment firm.\u00a0 Private equity firms have a notorious reputation for overtaking or forming monopolies in several industries by gobbling up publicly traded companies as private firms, which means they are not required by law to disclose information about their finances, operations, business risks, or legal liabilities. Such firms, though, are now in control of one-fifth of the American market, making a large chunk of the economy financially invisible to investors, the media and regulators.\u00a0 Phalippou\u2019s research is also meant to provide insight on how profitable private investment strategies really are in relation to the financial returns they generate. The report shows the median private equity fund earns just over 1.6-times investors\u2019 money over four to five years, which is comparable to the long-term returns of U.S. stocks.\u00a0 \u201cIt is hard for me to look at these numbers and be amazed,\u201d Phalippou told the FT.\u00a0 \u201cThe $1tn seems quite extraordinary. The return number, not so much,\u201d Phalippou said. \u201cIt is good but it is not something to write home about.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

They passed out \u201cmissing person\u201d flyers of the three main actors at the Sundance Film Festival, pleading for those with information to call a local sheriff. The film\u2019s website featured reels of policemen giving interviews about their investigation, while the IMDb page listed the actors as \u201cmissing, presumed dead.\u201d\u00a0 Only, the actors were not dead, or missing. Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard\u2014who, per their contract, used their real names in the film\u2014were alive, but forced to lay low for months to convince fans that the film\u2019s horrors were real. It was one of the first instances of viral marketing for a movie, and it was wildly successful. As the film skyrocketed into fame, Artisan Entertainment\u2014which acquired the film at Sundance for $1.1 million\u2014barred Donohue\u2019s publicist from booking her interviews. Leonard was chastised for accepting another independent movie role. Williams took on a job as a furniture mover, unable to secure any other acting gigs while playing dead.\u00a0\u00a0 The marketing scheme was so convincing that when Artisan Entertainment surveyed moviegoers, 50% of viewers believed The Blair Witch Project was real. The scheme helped the film become a sensation, earning over $248 million at the worldwide box office on a shoestring $35,000 budget, earning them a Guinness World Record for biggest box-office returns.\u00a0 When the film broke the $100 million mark, Donahue, Williams, and Leonard believed that, coming out of hiding, they would finally get their dues as the actors who filmed, improvised, and brought the story to life. Instead, they got a fruit basket, they recently told Variety.\u00a0 Back then, the three actors were in their early 20s\u2014Hollywood outsiders who took jobs on the indie film for its $500-a-week paycheck. Now, they are middle-aged, with jobs like high-school guidance counselor and marijuana farmer\u2014and ready to sue, or tell-all to Variety, to gain a fraction of the profits they say business executives cheated them out of.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t take care of your loved ones.\u201d\u00a0 When the young actors first signed their contracts, they didn\u2019t think much of a clause that required them to use their real names for the film. After all, the film was just another indie movie with a ridiculous premise that let them accrue on-set experience, and also offered them the miniscule pay of $500 a week (they filmed for eight days).\u00a0 \u201cI did a lot of work for no pay,\u201d Williams told Variety. \u201cThis said \u2018Paid,\u2019 so you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, maybe I can be a professional.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Another clause offered them an opportunity for profit that at the time seemed \u201cridiculous,\u201d according to Donohue. If the project net over $1 million, the actors were entitled to \u201ca one percent (1%) participation in profits in excess of $1,000,000.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, the movie ended up making much more than $1 million in profits. But the 1% was a measly sum, and, since the actors\u2019 real names were tied to their characters, they struggled to find casting directors who took them seriously. The cast members found themselves poor, but famous: serving catering to their own agents, or breaking down in old cars under huge billboards with their faces on it.The result, for the cast members, was as humiliating as it was ironic. Williams broke down in tears during the Variety interview, explaining how hard it was to explain his situation to others.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that I let this happen to me,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put that stuff away, because you\u2019re a f\u2014-g loser if you can\u2019t. Because everybody\u2019s wondering what happened, and your wife is in the grocery line and she can\u2019t pay because a check bounced. You\u2019re in the most successful independent movie of all time, and you can\u2019t take care of your loved ones.\u201d At the end of the summer of The Blair Witch Project\u2019s release, the actors received a \u201cperformance bump\u201d in the low five figures. Meanwhile, Lionsgate, which purchased Artisan and then Blumhouse, continued profiting from their names and likenesses for marketing, and created new, profitable sequels.\u00a0 In the mid-2000s, Donohue rallied her two co-stars to sue Artisan, which generated a $300,000 settlement that would be paid to each of them over several years. Meanwhile, Haxan, the production company that created The Blair Witch Project, earned an estimated \u201c$35 million to $40 million\u201d from the film, according to The New York Times.\u00a0 Last month, the three actors wrote a public letter calling for Liongate to give them residual payments \u201cequivalent to the sum that would\u2019ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made.\u201d They also requested \u201cmeaningful consultation\u201d on any further Blair Witch spinoffs that would utilize their names or likenesses. They also requested an annual $60,000 grant (the amount of the original Blair Witch budget) paid out yearly by Lionsgate to unknown filmmakers. The three\u2019s message to young actors: \u201cDon\u2019t do what we did.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for what I have now and how fucking hard I fought to get it,\u201d Williams told Variety.\u201dBut it still impacts me. I buried all this. Giant corporations don\u2019t care that this happens to young artists. It\u2019s bullshit. And that\u2019s got to change somehow.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Ron DeSantis\u2019 appointees on Wednesday\u00a0gave final approval to an agreement\u00a0that buries the hatchet between Disney and the governing district for Walt Disney World, which the Florida governor took over after the company two years ago publicly opposed a state law critics dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay.\u201d The five DeSantis-appointed board members to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District unanimously voted to approve a 15-year development deal in which the district committed to making infrastructure improvements in exchange for Disney investing up to $17 billion into Disney World over the next two decades. The agreement\u00a0followed a detente in March\u00a0in which both sides agreed to stop litigating each other in state court and work towards negotiating a new development agreement and a new comprehensive plan no later than next year. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things, and was controlled by Disney supporters before the takeover by the DeSantis appointees. District board member Brian Aungst said at Wednesday night\u2019s board meeting that the agreement provides a lasting and stable framework for Disney and the board to work together. \u201cThis is the day we all have been looking forward to,\u201d Aungst said. \u201cI was always extremely optimistic and knew we would get here because it was the right outcome.\u201d Under the deal, Disney will be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World\u2019s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also will need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida. Disney would then be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks, if it desired. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney will retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment. Leaders of Orlando\u2019s tourism industry praised the agreement, telling the district\u2019s board members that it will bring boundless jobs, tourists and attention to central Florida. \u201cIt very clearly demonstrates to the world that the district and Disney are eager to resume working together for the great state of Florida,\u201d said Robert Earl, founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International, Inc. Still up in the air was an appeal of a federal lawsuit Disney had filed against DeSantis and his appointees. After the settlement was reached in March, Disney asked the appellate court to put that case on hold while the development agreement was negotiated. The company has until next week to file a brief with the court if it wants to move ahead with the case. Disney didn\u2019t respond to an email Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on how the company planned to proceed. The DeSantis appointees to the district had planned to hold a closed-door discussion about the lawsuit after their board meeting Wednesday but cancelled that meeting. Matthew Oberly, a spokesperson for the district, said Wednesday night that the district didn\u2019t have any comment on the future of the federal litigation. The March settlement ended almost two years of litigation sparked by DeSantis\u2019 takeover of the district following the company\u2019s opposition to the 2022 law that bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches during his run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination until he\u00a0suspended his campaign\u00a0earlier this year. As punishment for Disney\u2019s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company\u2019s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge\u00a0dismissed\u00a0that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with the company shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees\u00a0claimed the \u201celeventh-hour deals\u201d neutered their powers, and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided. Disney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Instead it's thrown the school into chaos.","date":"2024-06-14T16:03:49Z","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It would have been the largest-ever private gift to a historically Black college or university: $237 million \u2014 far beyond the recipient\u2019s endowment. The money was promised by a 30-year-old who had recounted his rise from a childhood in foster care to becoming, as he put it, Texas\u2019 \u201cyoungest African American industrial hemp producer.\u201d And so, the first weekend of May,\u00a0Florida A&M University\u00a0celebrated Gregory Gerami\u2019s extraordinary contribution with all the necessary pomp. He spoke at commencement. Regalia-clad administrators posed with a jumbo check. Gerami even assured the audience that \u201cthe money is in the bank.\u201d It wasn\u2019t, and it may never be. Following public backlash over its apparent failure to properly vet Gerami and the donation, FAMU said the gift is\u00a0now on pause\u00a0\u2014 dashing expectations of increased financial stability for the 137-year-old institution and its 9,000 students. Gerami maintains everything will ultimately work out, but other small universities he approached with proposals for major donations never got any money. Gerami contacted Florida A&M\u2019s development office about a donation last fall, according to Shawnta Friday-Stroud, then-vice president for university advancement. University officials, including President Larry Robinson and Athletic Director Tiffani-Dawn Sykes, began meeting with him virtually shortly thereafter. In January, Atlanta\u2019s\u00a0Spelman College publicized a $100 million gift\u00a0\u2014 then considered the single largest donation to any HBCU. FAMU officials say Gerami wanted to surpass that figure. They ultimately agreed it would come through 14 million shares in his fledgling industrial hemp company. However, the value of the company \u2014 and those shares \u2014 remains unclear. Gerami founded Batterson Farms Corp in 2021 with aspirations of becoming a leading hemp plastics producer. While Texas Department of Agriculture records confirm the company is licensed to grow hemp, little else suggests that\u2019s happening. The company\u2019s website is sparse. Affiliate links to purchase HempWood products were broken and the shopping cart payment function failed when an Associated Press reporter visited the site in late May and early June. A confusing message to investors also warned of late fees for failing to complete monthly payments on time. Kimberly Sue Abbott, a founding board member who told the AP that she was incorrectly listed as co-CEO, cast doubt on Gerami\u2019s self-reported value of the shares and said Batterson Farms \u201cis not farming any hemp anywhere that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d She and Gerami met around 2013 during her time on the Birmingham City Council in Alabama. She felt he needed guidance on how to \u201cdo something good with his money.\u201d He has since invited her to partake in various ventures \u2014 none of which lasted, she said. \u201cHe never holds to a schedule. The information that he has is always flawed somehow. Technicalities are always an issue,\u201d she said. Greg Wilson, HempWood\u2019s founder, confirmed that Gerami is a customer but said he doesn\u2019t buy much.\u00a0High interest rates\u00a0have dampened both home sales and\u00a0interest in remodeling\u00a0with products like his, Wilson said, making it a bad time for wood-alternative businesses. Gerami described Abbott\u2019s characterizations as \u201cinaccurate\u201d and outdated. Without answering whether or not Batterson Farms is growing hemp, he said his company acts as an intermediary between farmers and consumers. He refused to provide specifics about the company\u2019s contracts, revenue and staffing. He also claimed that a third-party developer created the company\u2019s website, which he said was never intended to be a place where people could directly buy flooring. Florida A&M officials have shared little about their knowledge of Gerami or their vetting process. Friday-Stroud told FAMU Foundation board members last month that an \u201cexpansive screening\u201d into Gerami\u2019s background produced the same information that ended up \u201con social media,\u201d apparently referencing online upset over his previous reported donation attempts and his company\u2019s obscurity. Still, she said, they moved forward after looping in Robinson. Friday-Stroud signed a nondisclosure agreement on behalf of the foundation board on April 26 at Gerami\u2019s request, according to a\u00a0copy obtained by AP. They also announced the donation while awaiting a still outstanding independent appraisal of the private stock\u2019s worth, which Gerami said he assessed based on existing but undisclosed sales contracts. Officials have acknowledged that the appraisal could return with a much lower valuation. Stock donations and NDAs are not abnormal for university advancement offices. However, according to some higher education fundraisers, such donations usually come from wealthy shareholders of reputable public companies and NDAs should include the entire foundation board. \u201cYou want to make certain those resources are available, always, before you make the announcement,\u201d said W. Anthony Neal, a longtime HBCU fundraiser who dealt with Gerami in the past. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to come back with egg on your face.\u201d Companies typically get what\u2019s known as a 409A valuation from an independent third party before gifting shares, said Bob Musumeci, an Indiana University business professor with a background in corporate finance. Equity ownership, employee numbers, financial projects and other details all factor into the assessment. Outside investments from things like a family trust can also boost a company\u2019s worth beyond what sales numbers \u2014 and public data, if available \u2014 might suggest. Gerami didn\u2019t break any laws by flouting that norm, Musumeci said, but the fact that the gift wasn\u2019t properly assessed before being publicized is questionable. \u201cI would certainly be cautiously pessimistic about it. But I can\u2019t say whether it is or it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said of the valuation\u2019s accuracy. Both FAMU and Gerami have said the transfer of the stock certificates between their respective accounts took place in April. A spokesperson for Carta, the equity management company they say completed the exchange, would only confirm that the platform notified Gerami on May 14 that his contract was terminated over \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d he\u2019d made. They declined to comment on FAMU\u2019s assertion that it had an account with Carta and Gerami\u2019s claim that the company sent documentation confirming the transfer. Florida A&M is not the first school to receive a pitch from Gerami. Neal, the HBCU fundraiser, was overseeing a $3.4 million fundraising campaign in 2023 for the 150th anniversary of Wiley University in Marshall, Texas, when Gerami reached out. They discussed funding for new campus facilities in the $1 million to $2 million range, Neal said, and he began the \u201cnormal vetting process\u201d as the senior vice president of institutional advancement at the time. But not a lot of information surfaced. After at least seven conversations, Neal sought a one-on-one meeting to verify Gerami\u2019s legitimacy in person. Communications subsequently dropped off. \u201cSometimes donors just pull out,\u201d Neal said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything bad.\u201d However, three years prior, Coastal Carolina University also withdrew from a $95 million contribution made by an anonymous donor because he had \u201cnot fulfilled an early expectation of the arrangement,\u201d according to a press release. While CCU declined to name the anonymous donor in an email to AP, Gerami was identified as the benefactor last spring by\u00a0The Sun News in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Gerami told AP that he \u201cconsidered\u201d as many as 15 colleges and universities in recent years as part of a strategy to establish research partnerships that he said would make his company eligible for grants. Though Gerami did not disclose the names of those schools, those documented are all small institutions with scant endowments. He said he eyed institutions that needed funding and had the capacity for hydroponics, a method of growing plants without soil. The fallout at FAMU is palpable. The school ended its engagement with Gerami. Friday-Stroud resigned. University trustees \u2014 surprised they were left in the dark throughout the six-month process \u2014 approved a third-party investigation that state officials\u00a0have joined. Speaking May 15 before the trustees, Robinson described the announcement of Gerami\u2019s gift as \u201cpremature at best.\u201d \u201cI saw in this unprecedented gift the potential to serve our students and our athletic programs in ways unimaginable at that time,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI wanted it to be real and ignored the warning signs along the way.\u201d Days after announcing the donation, Robinson withdrew a $15 million request to a local economic development board to enhance FAMU\u2019s football stadium, according to\u00a0records obtained by AP. While he did not give a reason and the university declined to comment, the\u00a0gift agreement\u00a0shows a one-time $24 million allocation of Gerami\u2019s donation for athletics facilities. Millions annually were also supposed to fund scholarships, the nursing school and a student business incubator over the next decade. The public embarrassment has worried some HBCU supporters, who hope the outsize negative attention won\u2019t dampen an otherwise resurgent fundraising atmosphere. \u201cAs somebody that wants HBCUs to always succeed, this is really heartbreaking because there was so much excitement,\u201d said Marybeth Gasman, an education researcher at Rutgers University and three-time HBCU board member. \u201cJust real, real excitement for just a transformative gift of this magnitude.\u201d There was a time when HBCUs might have had to gamble on an unknown miracle donor, but Gasman said that\u2019s less common now. Long\u00a0overlooked by foundations\u00a0and\u00a0underfunded by some states, the schools have courted and gained\u00a0newfound corporate interest\u00a0in recent years. Still, public funding disparities persist. Historically Black land-grant universities in 16 states missed out on $12.6 billion over the past three decades \u2014 including $1.9 billion that should have gone to FAMU \u2014 according to a 2023 Biden administration analysis. For his part, Gerami believes the questions over his donation are unnecessary \u201cwhack-a-mole.\u201d He admitted the sum of his donation was his own estimate, but said he expects an independent valuation will confirm the shares\u2019 worth within the month. He said he also believes FAMU will accept the gift once its independent probe is complete. \u201cUntil a third-party valuation is done, this is all speculation,\u201d Gerami said. \u201cWe want to tread very carefully because we do not want to play games that lead to speculation without actual, factual information,\u201d he added. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The rise of artificial intelligence has been surrounded by plenty of doom and gloom. Debates about AI inevitably shift to its risk of replacing professionals and even entire industries\u2014from\u00a0doctors\u00a0and\u00a0radiologists\u00a0to\u00a0Tom Cruise\u2019s \u201cMaverick\u201d in Top Gun. America\u2019s AI-related anxieties are even\u00a0uniting Democrats and Republicans\u00a0on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0recently revealed\u00a0a bipartisan plan to tackle AI and protect traditional jobs. While there\u00a0are still many uncertainties about AI\u2019s impact, there is room for positivity when it comes to the economics of flourishing. AI\u2019s current iteration of Large Language Models\u00a0can\u00a0strengthen the American Dream by increasing social mobility and decreasing inequality. This potential to foster flourishing should be at the front and center of today\u2019s policymaking discussions. Starting with the glass half-full, AI has already improved education and learning, providing unprecedented access to knowledge. Besides just access to information, AI algorithms offer personalized learning experiences tailored to individual needs, irrespective of geographic location or socioeconomic background. Education leads to employment. While concerns about AI\u2019s impact on employment persist, there are still\u00a0more job openings\u00a0than\u00a0people looking for work.\u00a0Labor force participation\u00a0remains very low, showing that more people can and should join the labor market. The danger of AI automating our jobs is far into the future. Historical evidence suggests that new technologies often complement human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. AI LLMs can augment human intelligence, improving productivity and efficiency across various industries. As a result, individuals can transition into more complex and rewarding roles that require higher-order thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. For instance, \u201cnew-collar jobs\u201d are\u00a0on the rise, with AI and LLM helping develop skills through non-traditional education paths. This in turn leads to other types of jobs and even new employment categories. AI can also lower the barriers to entrepreneurship and innovation. AI-powered tools enable entrepreneurs to analyze vast amounts of data, identify market trends, and make informed decisions, leveling the playing field for startups and smaller enterprises. This fosters innovation and drives economic growth, ultimately leading to job creation across various sectors. AI can kickstart an entrepreneurial revolution and create new jobs, which\u00a0still\u00a0represent the most important source of income for people in the future. In many parts of the world, access to essential services such as healthcare, legal advice, and financial planning is limited, particularly for marginalized communities. Fortunately, AI has the potential to\u00a0bridge this gap\u00a0by offering virtual assistance and expert advice. Indeed, AI tools will potentially contribute\u00a0trillions of dollars\u00a0to the global economy by 2030. Flourishing also relies on a wide range of other factors that AI cannot replace or replicate.\u00a0Some of the most important literature in the social mobility field has shown the importance of family structure and parental engagement at a young age. The\u00a0work\u00a0of Nobel laureate James Heckman, along with various co-authors, suggests\u00a0parental engagement and early childhood education\u00a0are crucial in improving mobility and reducing inequality. Disparities in socioeconomic outcomes during teenage years and later in life can be traced back to early childhood. Two-parent households lead to more parental engagement, such as reading to children and playing with them. Mellisa Kearney\u00a0calls\u00a0it the \u201ctwo-parent privilege.\u201d Lenore Skenazy also\u00a0points\u00a0to the importance of free play in developing capabilities at an early age. AI may help parents and kids, but it can\u2019t replicate love. AI aside, policymakers should also identify other opportunities to boost economic prosperity, especially in terms of entrepreneurship.\u00a0One essential, bipartisan issue is occupational licensing, which\u00a0imposes barriers on certain occupations. If those barriers aren\u2019t removed, it won\u2019t matter whether different people learn new skills through AI, when they are not able to act on those new skills. Burdensome occupational licenses have been\u00a0shown\u00a0to be detrimental to upward social mobility, increasing income inequality. Another issue\u00a0crucial to social mobility\u00a0is social capital, community, and connectedness. AI may help address it by making people more productive at work and helping them gain free time that they can use to volunteer in their communities or spend it with their families. But, at the end of the day, building community is a human and social endeavor by nature. Human psychology still matters. If people don\u2019t feel like they have the agency to overcome the barriers in their way, no amount of AI will push them to climb the income ladder. The same goes for the importance of meaning and purpose in their lives. If these are missing, no amount of AI tools will create them. AI will be a powerful catalyst for social mobility in the 21st century\u2014but let\u2019s not overstate its potential. AI is called \u201cartificial\u201d for a reason. There are many other foundational pillars to flourishing, and we ignore those at our peril. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Both\u00a0Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Jeffrey Zients met behind closed doors on Thursday with the Business Roundtable in Washington, with Zients stepping in for Biden during the\u00a0president\u2019s meetings with Group of Seven\u00a0leaders in Italy. The prominent group representing more than 200 CEOs just rolled out an effort to preserve the tax breaks for businesses that Trump signed into law in 2017. Neither side commented publicly on what was said in the meeting, which comes as Biden and Trump head toward a 2020 rematch with sharply different views on taxes and the economy. Trump said that he would like to cut the corporate tax rate by a percentage point to an even 20%, according to a person familiar with his remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. The former president focused his remarks on taxes, inflation and the need for more oil production, the person said. Another person familiar with the conversations said Zients made the case that America\u2019s global reputation and its independent institutions such as the Federal Reserve fostered the kind of trust worldwide that allowed U.S. capitalism to thrive. The statements were a jab at Trump\u2019s camp, as the former president had previously hit allies with tariffs and sought greater control over Fed policies. Zients said the post-pandemic economic recovery was possible in part because the Biden administration worked with businesses on issues such as supply chains, the person said. And he indicated to the CEOs that Trump\u2019s pledges to deport millions of people and wage potential trade wars could drive up inflation. The person also insisted on anonymity to discuss details of the meeting, having not been authorized to do so publicly. The Business Roundtable has made low taxes its top legislative priority. The group announced that it would spend at least $10 million on a campaign to keep the corporate tax rate at 21% as well as promote business-friendly changes to the U.S. tax code and push to extend tax incentives for research and development. Part of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law while president is expiring after 2025, likely raising taxes for most U.S. households. That sets up a showdown between Democrats and Republicans about how to rewrite the tax code. Leaders from both parties want to preserve the cuts for those making under $400,000. But some Trump backers want to expand the tax cuts, including for companies. Biden would like to raise the corporate rate to 28% and introduce higher taxes on the wealthy to fund programs for the middle class. The Biden administration has also maintained that tax cuts should be paid for as part of a proposal, while the 2017 overhaul approved by Trump led to higher budget deficits as the promised growth did not materialize. Recent economic research\u00a0indicates that Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts did boost business investment, but not by enough for the additional growth needed to cover the cost of those tax cuts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a full extension of the expiring tax cuts would cost $4.9 trillion over 10 years, including additional interest on the debt. The federal government\u2019s publicly held debt stands at nearly $27.6 trillion. Business leaders argue that lower taxes make them more competitive globally. That enables them to hire more workers and invest in new technologies. This, in turn, would help boost growth. BRT members from Cisco and Procter & Gamble told reporters Wednesday that higher rates would cause them to invest less in the U.S. Jon Moeller, P&G\u2019s CEO and board chairman, said a tax increase would likely be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, limit wage growth for employees and be borne by shareholders. \u201cMaking the assumption that companies are big and strong and they can absorb this, that\u2019s kind of naive in terms of what will actually happen,\u201d Moeller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a societal impact.\u201d Biden\u2019s budget proposal would raise corporate taxes by nearly $2.2 trillion over 10 years. More than half of that new revenue would come from resetting the corporate tax rate at 28% \u2014 an increase, though still lower than the 35% rate Trump inherited. Trump, meanwhile, has suggested that higher corporate taxes would ravage the nation itself. \u201cBiden wants to raise taxes on top of that and raise business taxes, which will lead to the destruction of your jobs and, you know what, ultimately it\u2019s just going to lead to the destruction of the country,\u201d Trump said at a rally in May. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Lawsuits claiming pay discrimination against women in the tech industry have sometimes ended in substantial settlements that nonetheless can work out to\u00a0a paycheck or two\u00a0per person. The lawyers who filed Thursday\u2019s suit include those who have brought similar claims against Oracle Corp. and Google and won average per-person payouts of $3,750 and $5,500, respectively, after legal costs. Jong and Salgado filed the suit on behalf of more than 12,000 current and former female employees in Apple\u2019s engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions in California. They have both worked at Apple for more than a decade, according to the complaint.\u00a0 Salgado complained to Apple about the pay disparity a \u201cnumber of times\u201d but, despite conducting its own investigation, Apple didn\u2019t raise her salary until a third-party probe concluded there was a pay gap between her and her male counterparts, according to the complaint. She didn\u2019t receive back pay, according to her lawyers. Jong and Salgado are seeking unspecified wages they say they are owed. The suit was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 The case is Jong v. Apple, California Superior Court, San Francisco County. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

What to know about the sugar substitute","url":"https:\/\/fortune.com\/well\/article\/xylitol-sugar-substitute-heart-attack-stroke-risk\/","description":"The low-calorie sweetener is often marketed as a healthy glucose alternative.","date":"2024-06-14T13:05:00Z","content":"Your favorite sugar-free treats may be damaging your heart health. Higher amounts of the low-calorie sweetener xylitol, often marketed as a healthy sugar substitute, is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack, according to a new Cleveland Clinic study. A team of researchers including Dr. Stanley Hazen, chair of cardiovascular and metabolic sciences at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, identified an association between high levels of circulating xylitol and an elevated three-year risk of cardiovascular events in an analysis of more than 3,300 patients. The findings were published last week in the European Heart Journal.\u00a0 \u201cPeople whose levels of xylitol were in the top 25% of our population\u2014the top quarter\u2014they were at double the risk for a heart attack, stroke, and death than people whose levels were in the bottom quartile,\u201d Hazen tells Fortune. \u201cOur data is entirely consistent with xylitol being a prothrombotic compound (prone to causing blood clots), and it enhances cardiovascular risk\u2014the very compound that we are often recommending to patients to use as a sugar substitute, particularly if they\u2019re diabetic.\u201d In another part of the study, subjects were asked to drink xylitol-sweetened water. The amount of xylitol in each drink was comparable to that found in a serving of keto ice cream or diabetic cookies, Hazen says. Researchers then examined subjects\u2019 blood platelets, or thrombocytes, the cell fragments that form clots. \u201cAfter drinking this typical exposure, blood levels went up over 1,000-fold, to superphysiologic levels,\u201d Hazen says. \u201cThey stayed elevated into this high range\u2014which is associated with higher cardiovascular disease risk\u2014for the next four to six hours in every volunteer examined, and every platelet functional measure we looked at was substantially increased.\u201d This discovery comes just over a year after Hazen and his colleagues found a similar relationship between the artificial sweetener erythritol and cardiovascular event risk. In the U.S., xylitol isn\u2019t as common as erythritol in keto or sugar-free foods, according to a Cleveland Clinic news release. It is, however, abundant in other countries. Xylitol is sometimes labeled as sugar alcohol, so named because parts of its chemical structure resemble those of sugar and alcohol. Also called polyols, sugar alcohols are carbohydrates that occur naturally in some fruits and vegetables. They don\u2019t contain ethanol, the type of alcohol in alcoholic beverages. Sugar alcohols are popular sugar substitutes because they taste sweet but have fewer calories per gram than sugar, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They\u2019re typically used in combination with artificial sweeteners, and can be commercially produced from sugars and starch. Sugar alcohols prevent browning, help retain moisture, and add bulk and texture, per the FDA, making them an ideal ingredient in processed foods such as baked goods. Your body can\u2019t completely absorb sugar alcohols, which is why consuming them doesn\u2019t make your blood glucose spike like regular sugar does. That cooling sensation in your mouth after brushing your teeth? It\u2019s an indication of high sugar alcohol concentrations. Because sugar alcohols don\u2019t cause cavities, they\u2019re popular in oral care products. Xylitol in particular is common in chewing gum.\u00a0 As demand for low-sugar, low-calorie foods increases, the sugar alcohol market continues to boom. It\u2019s expected to exceed $1.8 billion by 2033, according to Persistence Market Research. Xylitol, also called birch or wood sugar, boasts low production costs that are another industry boon, Hazen says. \u201c[Xylitol] is literally made out of wood pulp and sawdust. It\u2019s cheaper to make xylitol than to isolate cane sugar out of sugarcane,\u201d Hazen tells Fortune. \u201cAnd it tastes just like sugar\u2014equal sweetness, it\u2019s granular\u2014so it has a lot of things going for it.\u201d These factors are also what makes xylitol so dangerous, he says. According to the FDA, the sugar substitute can be found in a number of food and other products, including: Last year, the World Health Organization advised against using nonsugar sweeteners, particularly as a means of weight management. As calorie-containing sugar derivatives, sugar alcohols were excluded from the agency\u2019s new guidance. Still, the decree marked a shift in how consumers view their relationship with sugar and its substitutes. The nonprofit food watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest recommends cutting back on xylitol, citing the fact that large amounts may lead to diarrhea. (In humans, that is; xylitol is deadly for dogs.) Hazen would rather you cut it out altogether. \u201cIf [you] want to sweeten something, at this point I think it\u2019s better to use sugar or honey or fruit, and in moderation,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re diabetic, you monitor your blood sugar.\u201d Consult your doctor and\/or nutritionist before making any drastic changes to your diet. Given the intricacies of cardiovascular disease and the limitations of Hazen\u2019s research, it would be a stretch to conclude that xylitol causes events such as stroke and heart attack, he says. Additional long-term studies are warranted. For example, it\u2019s unclear whether adolescents who frequently consume sugar substitutes will develop a higher risk of a cardiovascular event than their peers who don\u2019t. In the meantime, Hazen is concerned enough about the health hazards of xylitol that he\u2019s advocating for nutrition label overhauls. \u201cIt\u2019s a big public health issue,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to really be trying to lobby and get regulatory changes so that it\u2019s no longer generally recognized as safe.\u201d For more on sugar substitutes: Subscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

Capri Holdings\u2019s Versace, LVMH\u2019s Givenchy and Burberry Group have all slashed prices","date":"2024-06-14T11:03:20Z","content":"Some luxury labels are discounting their products to an unprecedented degree in China, reflecting a growing panic over unsold inventory as local consumers pull back on spending. Starting this month, Chinese shoppers can snap up a small beige, crocodile-patterned version of Balenciaga\u2019s iconic Hourglass handbag for $1,947, or 35% off on the mainland\u2019s dominant e-commerce platform, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s Tmall. That price is cheaper than what\u2019s listed on the brand\u2019s official websites globally and major luxury platforms including Farfetch.\u00a0 Balenciaga \u2014 part of French luxury giant Kering SA \u2014 averaged a 40% discount on sale items in three of the first four months of 2024, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private data.\u00a0 The brand has also more than doubled its number of discounted products on Tmall, accounting for more than 10% of its inventory on the platform from January to April, the people said. During the same period last year, Balenciaga only discounted items in January, and at an average of roughly 30%, according to the people. It had no markdowns at all in the first four months of 2022, they said.\u00a0 A similar trend can be seen for other labels. Capri Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Versace, LVMH\u2019s Givenchy and Burberry Group PLC have all slashed prices, some by more than half, on Tmall and other domestic platforms this month. Versace\u2019s average discount jumped from roughly 40% at the start of 2023 to over 50% this year, according to the people familiar. \u00a0 Versace and several other premium brands have also offered discounts for longer periods of time so far this year than they did in 2023, the people said. The number of products on sale shot up to the hundreds in the first four months from only a few last year, they added. The price war would have been unthinkable just a few years ago for labels whose growth stems from an image of exclusivity and products that keep their value. It\u2019s rare to see luxury brands, which usually try and clear stock out of sight in outlet malls or through private sales, put such deep discounts front and center on a flagship platform.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I find surprising and frankly ill-advised is that these discounts are being offered on the most visible consumer touch point in the world, which is Tmall,\u201d said Jacques Roizen, managing director of China consulting at Digital Luxury Group. It\u2019s \u201cthe equivalent of hosting a public sale on Fifth Avenue or the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\u201d Kering declined to comment, while Capri and LVMH didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Burberry didn\u2019t comment on the discounts.\u00a0 The strategy underscores the predicament global fashion houses face in the mainland as an economic slowdown erodes household wealth. While upscale labels are counting on China to boost revenue and improve performance, the country\u2019s middle class \u2014 a pillar of the global luxury market \u2014 is growing increasingly frugal, holding out for sales or backing away altogether from major purchases.\u00a0 Compounding some luxury brands\u2019 pain are high return rates on Tmall, fueled by the platform\u2019s promotional campaigns allowing people who meet certain spending thresholds to obtain discounts \u2014 even if they later return some of their purchases. That\u2019s led some shoppers to game the system, ordering expensive items just to secure rebates. Underscoring the challenging environment, Richemont\u2019s luxury e-commerce platform Net-A-Porter is pulling out of China, with its operator in the country \u2014 a joint venture between Richemont and Alibaba \u2014 announcing internally that the firm will soon shut down, industry media including WWD reported Friday.\u00a0 Richemont and Alibaba didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0 Meanwhile, labels at the highest end of the luxury market, including Hermes International SCA, Chanel and LVMH\u2019s Louis Vuitton, appear to be faring\u00a0better. They\u2019ve foregone discounts, limited e-commerce exposure and focused on cultivating high net worth clients, making them more immune to economic downturns.\u00a0 Some brands, including Kering\u2019s Gucci, Prada SpA and sister brand Miu Miu, also refrain from offering public discounts on China\u2019s e-commerce platforms, said the people familiar.\u00a0 While discounts might help clear inventory in the short term, frequent price cuts could make brands appear too accessible and drive away coveted VIP clients, said Angelito Perez Tan, Jr., co-founder and CEO of RTG Group Asia, whose businesses include a luxury consultancy. Some high-end labels discount merchandise around events like Black Friday, but markdowns are usually lower than the current China sales, he said.\u00a0 Online orders made up nearly half of China\u2019s luxury revenue last year, according to consultancy Yaok Group, with Tmall capturing the majority of that spending. \u00a0 Faltering demand from the Chinese market has already hurt luxury earnings. Kering\u00a0warned\u00a0in April of a potential first-half profit drop of as much as 45%, hurt by weak Gucci sales in China. Burberry\u2019s stock has more than halved in the past year off weak demand in China and the US. Chanel\u00a0cautioned\u00a0that conditions, even at the higher end, are growing more challenging.\u00a0 Japan\u2019s weak yen is also contributing to slowing sales in China, as people\u00a0flock\u00a0there seeking out the lowest prices they can find. \u201cIt seems natural that, given this context, brands that are selling less than they had anticipated try to monetize their inventory and offer promotions,\u201d said Sanford C. Bernstein retail analyst Luca Solca. \u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The expedited path to residency welcomed digital nomads but also more than doubled home prices in eight years and prompted protests as a result of exorbitant rents.\u00a0\u00a0 While Portugal is still recovering from the string of events that an influx of expats spurred, it isn\u2019t closed to the idea of repeat tourists or short-term rentals\u2014especially in the country\u2019s second-largest city, Porto.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Famous for its historic sites and port wine, Porto has also experienced soaring interest among tourists and expats alike. Yet the local government sees that as a boon to changing the city\u2019s course.\u00a0 \u201cThe repeating tourist is the best tourist we can have,\u201d Rui Moreira, Porto\u2019s mayor, told Bloomberg. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we should focus our attention.\u201d His hope? Tapping on short-term rentals, such as those offered by Airbnb, as a way to regenerate the city and save it from possible ruin.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreira acknowledges that the city needs to be selective about where it allows or avoids such rentals, given Portugal\u2019s Airbnb restrictions announced last year. Still, the rising tide of tourists could help change the city for the better.\u00a0 Portugal is an easy sell for anyone looking to move there\u2014warm weather, great cuisine, low cost of living, and, until recently, a relatively low barrier for entry. But golden visas have been contentious, with Portuguese political parties disputing whether or not it was instrumental in worsening the housing crisis.\u00a0 Portugal isn\u2019t alone in walking back its attractive residency route for the wealthy\u2014Spain recently announced it would scrap its golden visa in a bid to make housing affordable again.\u00a0\u00a0 The rejigged program in Portugal now bans property as a route for investing in the country to gain residency rights. Will that help fix the broken housing market? It\u2019s hard to tell just yet. In Spain, for instance, the golden visa scheme had little impact on the lack of housing, property website Idealista found. Portugal attracted a record-breaking number of tourists last year\u2014up 19% from 2022 to over 18 million. Tourism is one of the economy\u2019s key pillars, accounting for nearly 15% of its GDP.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite its significance to the country, the travel and tourism industry has been at the center of recent debate over locals struggling to find affordable housing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat we think is expensive, is cheap for them,\u201d Moreira said of Portugal\u2019s property crisis, referring to expats.\u00a0 The mayor wants to diffuse the volume of tourists by encouraging them to visit the less sought-after areas and creating a stream of repeat visitors to the city. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s also meant more expats live in Porto now\u2014but Moreira thinks they have \u201ca very significant impact.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve never been seeking to attract golden visas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not so much a city of retirees. We\u2019re much more a city of young nomads who come here to work at these companies.\u201d Porto\u2019s houses have become 32% more expensive in the past five years. It plans to invest \u20ac76 million in housing through 2026, including building new homes and paying private homeowners to sublet their properties at lower rates.\u00a0 \u201cThere isn\u2019t a magic wand for the issue of housing,\u201d Moreira said. \u201cWe have to find fair measures and various medicines.\u201d A spokesperson at Airbnb told Fortune that the company \u201cunderstands the housing and tourism challenges in Portugal and wants to be part of the solution.\u201d The new regulations will \u201cgive governments the information they need to clamp down on speculators and overtourism,\u201d the representative added.

And while Nvidia is, thus far, the undisputed winner of the chip wars, it soon could be facing a robust challenger. Broadcom, an American semiconductor manufacturer, announced a 10-to-1 stock split and better-than-expected earnings in its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. In the report, Broadcom also projected $51 billion in sales for the 2024 fiscal year, slightly higher than anticipated. Shares soared that day in after-hours trading and were going for about $1,740 around 3 p.m. ET on Friday\u2014about 16% higher than their Wednesday opening price near $1,500. In a note to investors on Thursday, Bank of America boosted its target price for Broadcom shares to $2,000 and raised its 2025 fiscal year sales forecast to $59.9 billion, which would be a 16% year-over-year gain. BofA cited semiconductor sales and its acquisition of software firm VMWare last year. \u201cWe reiterate Buy, consider it a top AI pick\u201d along with Nvidia, the analysts wrote, citing Broadcom\u2019s potential growth in custom chips, ethernet networking, and VMWare upsells. If BofA\u2019s prediction materializes, that would push Broadcom\u2019s market cap past $1 trillion and into an exclusive club currently occupied by just six firms: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta. Nvidia, valued near $3.25 trillion, is the only chip manufacturer to reach a 13-figure market cap. In just the past week, it overtook both Amazon and Alphabet, and last it week briefly nudged past Apple for the second spot behind Microsoft before retreating to third. Nvidia volume today is about as much as the next 10 most traded stocks combined. I don't think I've ever seen that large of a gap bf, it's weird. pic.twitter.com\/hJgprCM6vw The dominance of Nvidia, a company unknown to many consumers, is both simple and complicated. The short answer is that it produces chips that are becoming essential to every corner of the economy. The longer answer is that for the past 15 years or so, developers have built code around Nvidia\u2019s CUDA architecture, making it difficult to unravel. Last year, over $4 billion was invested into 93 separate efforts to do so, according to PitchBook. And earlier this year, the Unified Acceleration Foundation, or UXL, was formed by Intel, Google, Arm, Qualcomm, Samsung, and other tech companies to develop open-source software to free AI developers beholden to CUDA. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

As part of the enforcement action, the Arkansas-based bank will have to strengthen its compliance with existing partners, such as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d fintech giant Affirm, which earlier this week announced a partnership with Apple. Affirm declined to comment. In April, Evolve had customer funds associated with pig-butchering scams\u00a0seized. It also provided banking services for fintech Synapse Financial Technologies, which went\u00a0bankrupt\u00a0in May.\u00a0Evolve partners as well with banking fintech Mercury, which provides services for startups. The Federal Reserve Board noted: \u201cFor current partnerships with financial technology companies, the Board\u2019s action requires Evolve to strengthen its risk management practices to address potential risks, including compliance and fraud risks, by implementing appropriate oversight and monitoring of those relationships, including through enhanced procedures related to recordkeeping and consumer compliance programs.\u201d Konrad Alt of regulatory advisory firm Klaros Group says that many major players providing banking as a service products are under formal or informal enforcement actions. But that \u201ceach of these orders contains a little bit of regulatory innovation. Banks that are in the space will want to read the Evolve order carefully to see if it has implications for them.\u201d In 2023, banking as a service banks accounted for 13.5% of \u201csevere enforcement actions\u201d issued by federal bank regulators, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\u00a0 The Board\u2019s enforcement action against Evolve is independent of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding Synapse, according to the statement. In an email sent to to Fortune, an Evolve spokesperson acknowledged that the company had signed the receipt of a formal order from the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department and had agreed to take certain measures to \u201cfurther bolster\u201d its compliance oversight and risk management practices. \u201cWe\u2019ve made significant investments in technology and personnel in our enterprise risk management, compliance, and BSA\/AML departments to strengthen oversight and enhance the risk framework,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. \u201cWith the support of our senior management and board of directors, we\u2019re confident this order\u2019s impact will result in a stronger Evolve.\u201d According to the Fed, the action resulted from examinations conducted in 2023 that found that Evolve failed to have in place an effective risk management framework for its partnerships and did not maintain an effective risk management program. This was not part of a formal investigation. Evolve called the examinations part of a \u201croutine regulatory review\u201d and said the order was similar to what others in the banking as a service industry had also received. Evolve noted that the Fed order \u201cdoes not affect our existing business, customers, or deposits. Evolve remains well-capitalized and continues to show strong growth across all business lines.\u201d  The Evolve board of directors has 90 days to submit a written plan to strengthen board oversight of the management and operations of the bank and the bank\u2019s compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money-laundering regulations.  \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Carlos Tavares says his arrogance is to blame for failing to address three converging issues the automaker ran into in its U.S. market. The group behind Fiat, Chrysler, and Jeep has faced declining sales and stalled inventory in the U.S., which has caused its market share to shrink. Tavares said Stellantis was too slow to sell down inventory, ran into manufacturing issues, and lacked \u201csophistication in the way to go to market.\u201d There was an arrogance in failing to recognize those combined factors fast enough, Tavares said. \u201cWhen I am saying we were arrogant, I\u2019m talking about myself, nobody else. I\u2019m talking about the fact that I should have acted immediately, recognizing that the convergence of those three problems was there, and we had to set up a task force to address them,\u201d Tavares said at Stellantis\u2019s investor day. \u201cIf you have a marketing strategy that is suboptimal, at the moment when your inventory grows and your plants start having problems, you think that you can fix each of the issues in isolation, but if the three things happen at the same time, it is more difficult,\u201d he added. Stellantis\u2019s sales in the U.S. declined 14% in the first quarter of the year, amid a wider fall in global revenues.\u00a0 The carmaker saw inventories for Jeep and Ram brands jump at the start of the year, Cox Automotive reported.\u00a0 Tavares said the group\u2019s manufacturing issues in the U.S. occurred at two unnamed plants. However, he said it wouldn\u2019t take \u201crocket science\u201d to fix them: \u201cIt is something we have done tons of times, everywhere in the world.\u201d The group remains profitable and has undertaken a rigorous cost-cutting regime that has caused its headcount to fall by almost 50,000 since 2019. While Tavares works to renew Stellantis\u2019s operations in the U.S., he also took the time to highlight his opposition to tariffs, after the European Union slapped Chinese carmakers with import levies of up to 38.1%. While European automakers are threatened by cheap Chinese EVs, they have reason to be wary of tariffs. Retaliation from Beijing would likely impede automakers\u2019 ability to sell their cars in the Chinese market, while also increasing the price of crucial inputs for their own EVs.\u00a0 Carmakers have also begun forming strategic partnerships with Chinese manufacturers to take advantage of synergies in the market. Stellantis bought a 21% stake in Chinese brand Leapmotor earlier this year to help develop an affordable EV. Tavares has previously lamented the idea of tariffs as a race to the bottom. He doubled down on that sentiment at Stellantis\u2019s investor day, saying he wouldn\u2019t rely on tariffs to stay competitive.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to fight to be as competitive as we should be in the performance of the products, in the range, in the affordability. We\u2019re going to compete because we are a global company.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

But its AI-driven search chatbot is already facing challenges as some news media companies object to its business practices and\u00a0tech giants Google,\u00a0and now Apple, are increasingly fusing similar AI features into their core products. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has spent much of the past week defending the company after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story but without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission.\u00a0Forbes said\u00a0it later found similar \u201cknock-off\u201d stories lifted from other publications. The Associated Press separately found another Perplexity product feature inventing fake quotes from real people, including a former elected town official from Martha\u2019s Vineyard falsely quoted to say he didn\u2019t want the Massachusetts island to become\u00a0a destination for marijuana. \u201cI never said that,\u201d said Bill Rossi, a former member of the island town of Chilmark\u2019s select board. Srinivas told The Associated Press that his company is trying to build positive relationships with news publishers that ensure their news content \u201creaches more people.\u201d \u201cWe can definitely coexist and help each other,\u201d he said. Asked about Forbes, he said his product \u201cnever ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else\u2019s content,\u201d in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies\u2019 AI systems generate. \u201cWe are actually more of an aggregator of information and providing it to the people with the right attribution,\u201d Srinivas said. But, he added, \u201cIt was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source. We took that feedback immediately and updated changes that day itself. And now the sources are more prominently highlighted.\u201d Perplexity also revealed this week that it has been seeking revenue-sharing partnerships that would pay news publishers a portion of Perplexity\u2019s advertising revenue each time an outlet\u2019s news content is referenced as a source. Randall Lane, chief content officer of Forbes Media, called the dispute an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the conversation about AI. \u201cIt\u2019s a case study in where we\u2019re heading,\u201d Lane told the AP. \u201cIf the people who are leading the charge don\u2019t have a fundamental respect for the hard work of doing proprietary reporting, and keeping people informed with value-added content, we\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d A self-described \u201cAI bull\u201d who believes that the technology could help make many news organizations more efficient, Lane said the dispute between Perplexity and Forbes is important because it is a \u201cmetaphor for what can happen if the people controlling the AI don\u2019t respect the people doing the work.\u201d Perplexity bills itself as a search engine while \u201cacting like a media company and publishing a story\u201d that only Forbes had reported, Lane said. \u201cThe whole thing was very disingenuous. And what we didn\u2019t hear was, \u2018Oops, yeah we messed that one up and we need to do better,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it was just putting out more content, little tweaks to the model and treating journalism like it\u2019s just a commodity to be manufactured.\u201d Srinivas, a computer scientist and former AI researcher at OpenAI and Google, co-founded Perplexity in the summer of 2022, not long before the AI image-generator Stable Diffusion and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT began sparking the public\u2019s fascination with the possibilities of generative AI. Inspired, in part, by his childhood love of Wikipedia, he described Perplexity to the AP as \u201clike a marriage of Wikipedia and ChatGPT\u201d that can instantly answer a person\u2019s questions without the \u201chuge cluttered mess\u201d of Google\u2019s conventional search results. \u201cYou ask a question, you get an answer with clean sources, and there\u2019s like three or four suggested (follow-up) questions and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said of Perplexity. \u201cThat way people\u2019s minds can be free from distractions, and they can just focus on learning and digging deeper.\u201d The company sells a subscription for premium features and is planning to start an advertising-based service as it grows its user base. \u201cWe are not profitable as a company today, but we are also more sustainably run than foundation model companies because we do not train our own foundation models,\u201d which requires huge amounts of computing power, he said. Perplexity relies on existing AI large language models such as those built by OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook; and then \u201cpost-trains\u201d them. \u201cWe shape them to be really good summarizers,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not always clear where the summarized information is coming from. One Perplexity feature called Writing \u2014 which enables a user to \u201cgenerate text or chat without searching the web\u201d \u2014 produces lengthy and unsourced commentary, often in the style of a news article. Tests of the feature by an AP reporter asking it to write about\u00a0the lack of marijuana\u00a0on Martha\u2019s Vineyard led it to produce a 465-word document that resembled a news article and included fabricated quotations from the former town official and another real person. The AP is not repeating the false quotes in order to avoid perpetuating misinformation. Srinivas said that the Writing feature of Perplexity is a \u201cminor use case\u201d that was intended for helping to compose essays or correcting grammar when primary source information isn\u2019t needed. He said it\u2019s \u201cmore prone to hallucinations\u201d \u2014 a\u00a0common problem with AI\u00a0large language models \u2014 because it isn\u2019t tethered to the web search capabilities of Perplexity\u2019s core product. \u201cThere is no doubt that generative AI is upending journalism, content creation, and search,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute. She pointed to Google\u2019s new, Perplexity-like approach that summarizes answers based on information pulled from crawling the web, as an example. That, too, led to false information and forced\u00a0Google to make adjustments\u00a0to the product after its public release. \u201cBut their whole model of advertising is based on sending people to websites,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhy will people go to websites if they can have the one-stop-shop of the answer in the AI output?\u201d Srinivas claimed to the AP that \u201ca lot of people get referrals from Perplexity, and I\u2019m happy that they\u2019re getting referrals from a new player in the internet.\u201d For now, much of that benefit may be aspirational. Perplexity\u2019s worldwide user base has grown rapidly this year to more than 85 million web visits in May, but that barely registers compared to the billions of users of ChatGPT and other popular platforms from Microsoft and Google, according to\u00a0data from Similarweb. The debate demonstrates the \u201cuncertain and challenging times\u201d for online content creators in general and journalism in particular because aggregators only work if publications such as Forbes exist, said Stephen Lind, an associate professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. Using AI as a synthesizing tool works for widespread dissemination of information until \u201cyou\u00a0run out of originals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are whole companies or whole applications that are also doing this, where they are rolling out new services without fully thinking through the implications or best practices or safeguards because they\u2019re rolling out applications for industries that maybe they\u2019re not native to,\u201d he said. Lind said it\u2019s good that companies like Perplexity are \u201ctaking at least some steps to course correct when an industry or a user pushes back.\u201d But some of the changes should have been baked in from the beginning, he added. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Use a roaming eSIM to avoid data fees","url":"https:\/\/fortune.com\/europe\/2024\/06\/14\/how-to-travel-on-a-budget-in-europe-this-summer-use-a-roaming-esim-to-avoid-data-fees\/","description":"Use a travel eSIM to look up your Airbnb on Google Maps, share Instagram videos from the Eiffel Tower, or message friends and family back home on WhatsApp.","date":"2024-06-14T09:00:52Z","content":"For summer trips overseas, a smartphone is essential for most people. How else will you check Google Maps to find your Airbnb, post an Instagram video from the Eiffel Tower, or WhatsApp friends and family back home? Of course, if you\u2019re using apps that gobble up data while traveling in a foreign country, there\u2019s always a risk of racking up hefty roaming fees from your phone carrier. The solution? An international travel eSIM for your smartphone. How do you use this technology? Here are some tips. If you\u2019ve ever bought a new cellphone, you\u2019re probably familiar with the SIM card. Short for subscriber identity module, the SIM is a little chip the size of a fingernail that fits into a slot on most phones. Without it, you couldn\u2019t get cell service because it contains your account information and phone number. But physical SIM cards are slowly being replaced by eSIMs \u2014 the e stands for embedded \u2014 built into newer phones. These digital versions do the same thing and can make life easier, though people used to physical SIMs might find them confusing at first. They make switching cell carriers easier. And if you\u2019ve bought a new phone recently, you might not even have a choice: Apple got rid of the SIM card tray starting with the iPhone 14 released in September 2022. They\u2019re especially beneficial for travelers. If you\u2019ve got a compatible cellphone, you can add an eSIM from a virtual carrier that has better data roaming rates than your home network. Many phones will allow you to add more than one eSIM, making it easy to switch back and forth, or \u2014 for phones with the capability \u2014 use two at the same time. Think of the convenience: Gone are the days of arriving in a strange country after a long flight, looking for a local phone company\u2019s airport kiosk, carefully popping open the SIM tray with a pin to swap in the new chip, and trying not to lose the existing one. The eSIM market is booming. Kester Mann, director of consumer research at CCS Insight, says there are dozens of providers that can be found online, with names like Nomad, Holafly, Easysim, Airhub and Airalo. \u201cThese guys have a role to play because I think they offer a very affordable and attractive opportunity for international travelers,\u201d Mann said. The boom means there\u2019s plenty of competition keeping rates low. Prices are typically clearly displayed online, either through a menu of packages on the provider\u2019s website or a calculator based on the amount of data needed and trip length. Some 800 carriers support eSIMs, according to CCS, so international coverage is extensive. Many eSIM providers offer packages based on country or region, so you can check which ones have good rates for the place you\u2019ll be visiting and sign up in advance. Traveling to Europe and need data for a month covering 30 countries? Airalo offers, for example, 10 gigabytes at $37 while Holafly\u2019s package has unlimited data for 69 euros ($75). For an upcoming trip to Prague, I bought 5 gigabytes of data for just $5 from Global Yo. I was slightly put off by some negative reviews professing problems buying, installing or activating the company\u2019s eSIMs, but I didn\u2019t have any problems myself. You\u2019ll need a phone that\u2019s unlocked for use with different wireless carriers. If you\u2019re not setting up a new phone, the typical activation method is with a QR code, or a more conventional string of numbers and letters. If you\u2019re planning a trip and buy one before you leave, it\u2019s a good idea to print out the code if you don\u2019t want to activate right away. For iPhones, go to your Settings menu, then to either the Cellular or Mobile Service section, then tap Add eSIM. You\u2019ll be prompted to scan the code, or manually enter it. The process is similar for Android users. Samsung has a\u00a0guide\u00a0for Galaxy devices, and Google has a\u00a0help page\u00a0for Pixel users, while eSIM carriers have step-by-step instructions. Apple has a\u00a0YouTube video, as well as tip sheets on using eSIMs for\u00a0international travel\u00a0and on using two eSIMs simultaneously. If you\u2019ve got a phone that supports dual eSIMs, you \u201ccan pick potentially the best network based on price and or coverage\u201d while traveling, said Mann. Some carriers have their own apps to manage eSIMs and track data usage. More than 200 devices support the technology, CCS Insight says. U.K. phone company Vodafone has a\u00a0list\u00a0of compatible devices. Or dial (asterisk)#06# \u2014 an EID code indicates it\u2019s compatible. For iPhone users, it\u2019s any model released since the XS, XS Max or XR, as well as recent iPads. They\u2019re compatible with any Samsung Galaxy devices released since 2020, and Google Pixel 4 and newer models will work; some Pixel 3 devices also support them. First check your own carrier\u2019s roaming costs for the places you\u2019re visiting. Sometimes it\u2019s not worth it. \u201cRoaming costs these days are far lower and less prohibitive than they once were,\u201d said Mann. They\u2019ve even been abolished for European Union residents crossing the 27-nation bloc\u2019s internal borders. But travelers in Britain, which has left the EU, are facing them again for travel to the continent. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

A price measure that strips out energy costs and the effect of interest-rate changes rose 3% from a year earlier, according to data\u00a0published\u00a0by Statistics Sweden on Friday. That was higher than the median estimate of 2.6% in a Bloomberg survey of analysts as well as the central bank\u2019s 2.9% forecast. While some of the increase in prices could be explained by an increase in accommodation prices as Taylor Swift fans flooded the nation\u2019s capital for three concerts, prices of clothing, food and travel also increased. Hotel prices rose by 11% from April, the biggest monthly increase since May 2019, and larger than May last year, when two\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 shows\u00a0in the capital attracted some 100,000 spectators.\u00a0 The reading comes as subsiding price pressures have prompted the Swedish central bank to embark on a path toward monetary-policy easing. The Riksbank\u00a0cut\u00a0its benchmark rate to 3.75% from 4% in May and has said it expects to reduce borrowing costs twice more before year-end.\u00a0 The easing moves are set to provide much-needed fuel to a sluggish Swedish economy, which is widely seen as more sensitive to interest-rate changes than many peers\u2019, as most household mortgages have rates fixed on short terms.\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

It\u2019s always going to happen this way.\u201d Why? Because believing that you always know best will not only stifle your own personal growth but also the business\u2019s.  But he\u2019s not always been the most receptive to new ideas and ways of working himself. \u201cI sometimes could have been that person in my past, on certain things,\u201d Buechel, who took Whole Foods helm in September 2022, said.\u00a0 \u201cI learned the hard way that you have to be flexible, especially in today\u2019s world,\u201d the 46-year-old added. \u201cOur customers\u2019 demands are changing all the time, things are always changing the business.\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly then, the organic supermarket chain chief said he \u201cgravitates\u201d towards solutions-oriented workers who like \u201cto solve things that help the organization, help our stakeholders [and] our team members.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m a problem solver. That\u2019s what I love and get excited about,\u201d he concluded. Of course, know-it-alls mostly mean well. After seeing what works (and what doesn\u2019t) over time, it\u2019s only natural to want to share that expertise rather than watch your employer flounder.\u00a0 It\u2019s why career experts tell Fortune that being knowledgeable isn\u2019t the issue\u2014it\u2019s often the manner in which ideas are communicated that can cause problems. John Lees, the former chief of the Institute of Employment Consultants, has authored 15 books on careers. He advises imparting knowledge with as much caution as you would if you were bragging about yourself. \u201cTone and brevity matters,\u201d Lees says, adding that it\u2019s better to start a contribution with \u201cThis might be helpful\u2019 than \u2018The answer is\u2019. In the end, he highlights that your knowledge in an area \u201ccan easily point to someone else\u2019s lack of,\u201d which is why it can be taken offensively.  Avoid accidentally criticizing others by starting input with: \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d \u201cIf you think your wisdom irritates, save it for a few key moments where your contribution will make a difference,\u201d Lees concludes. \u201cHaving an opinion on everything is a sure way to ensure you\u2019re never heard.\u201d Una Doyle, a business strategist and impact coach for SMEs at Creative Flow, echoed that there are three elements to whether feedback is taken as helpful instead of annoying: timing, relevancy, and approach. \u201cFirstly, either schedule a time to speak about it or pick a time where they seem to be in a good mood,\u201d Doyle says. \u201cSecondly, focus on what\u2019s in it for them and lead with that.\u201d \u201cFinally, ensure that you\u2019re calm and centered and notice their response to your feedback,\u201d she adds. \u201cMost people don\u2019t like feedback, even when it\u2019s constructive, so be kind and, if you can, coach them to the same realization you\u2019ve had instead of just telling them how you see it.\u201d Other career experts told Fortune that managers are probably to blame if they have know-it-alls on their team. \u201cNormally, it\u2019s when people are trying to establish themselves as a dominant force in the office, there is normally an underlying reason,\u201d warns Tim Mart, careers coach and founder of the employee coaching and training provider Know You More. For one, he says, it could be a sign of imposter syndrome, which results in people wanting to prove their worth to their peers or higher-ups. \u201cSo rather than come down on them, it\u2019s worth having a discussion about why they might be offering out advice when it\u2019s unsolicited,\u201d Mart adds. \u201cThey might also just have a lot of good ideas that they are not communicating in the right way.\u201d His advice to managers is to learn where this behavior is coming from before offering feedback on how they could better present their ideas. \u201cThis employee clearly has a lot of knowledge, so find ways to utilize it,\u201d Mart concludes. \u201cHelping people work to their strengths is a win-win situation, both for the employer and the employer.\u201d Dan Buckley, the CEO of Cognexo, works with companies like DHL, Shell Energy, and Zenith to boost employee engagement. He echoes that management is key to turning insufferably vocal workers into helpful subject matter experts. His top tip? Roll out regular employee surveys. \u201cThis method helps know-it-alls present their insights in a more objective and less aggressive manner, promoting constructive dialogue,\u201d Buckley says. It\u2019s a win-win for businesses that genuinely want input on specific areas of the business: \u201cStructured questions ensure that feedback is specific, relevant and consistent, making it easier to analyze and act upon.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Might he be angling to exert actual influence over the brick-and-mortar retailer\u2019s ongoing transformation by demanding a seat on the board?\u00a0 On Thursday, the meme stock trader extraordinaire, a.k.a. Keith Gill, posted an\u00a0update\u00a0to Reddit showing he has made $58 million so far since first revealing his position in the company at the start of this month.\u00a0 But Gill\u2019s loyal band of small shareholders in GameStop, whose business selling physical copies of video games threatens to be crushed by the shift toward cloud gaming, saw a hidden message. Roaring Kitty pulling up to the next GameStop board meeting pic.twitter.com\/GVmxdlBTxN One week ago Gill was poised to become a\u00a0billionaire on paper\u00a0during his first livestream in three years, just one day before turning 38 years old. GameStop chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen foiled his plans that very day, showering the market with 75 million newly issued shares\u2014a 20% capital increase\u2014to\u00a0rake in $2 billion, tanking the stock in the process. In a joke, Gill later appeared on the stream with his right arm in a sling and a bandage wrapped around his head, laughing off the misfortune and downing a beer to celebrate his birthday. But with his latest trade, the jokester known for communicating through pop culture memes may now have sent a very serious message to Cohen.\u00a0 In a screenshot posted to Reddit, where he goes by the name DeepF\u2013kingValue, Gill finally revealed the answer to the biggest question everyone was asking: What would he do with the 120,000 call options that were due to expire if not exercised by June 21? Judging from the evidence he wanted everyone to see, it appeared as if Gill had closed out his entire position by the end of trading yesterday, liquidating 79,990 contracts while taking delivery of the rest in stock.\u00a0 However he managed it, his holdings went from precisely 5 million shares, where they had been since the very first Reddit post earlier this month, to 9,001,000 shares\u2014no more, no less.\u00a0 GameStop investors were quick to point out this wasn\u2019t by accident, nor was it coincidence. This seemingly random figure equated exactly to the number of shares owned by GameStop CEO Cohen when he\u00a0announced in a December 2020 SEC filing that he had raised his GameStop stake to 12.9%.\u00a0 A month later, the Chewy cofounder was\u00a0on the board\u00a0of the company. That very year George Sherman\u00a0vacated\u00a0his position as CEO and by late last year, the activist investor Cohen was\u00a0named chairman and CEO. Some believe this oblique reference to Cohen may explain a meme Gill posted earlier this week from\u00a0The Office, in which the fictional Michael Scott wears a short-sleeved shirt from whose pocket a kitty is poking out. In it a younger, awkward looking Scott is meeting his boss\u2014potentially a sly homage to the GameStop chair and chief executive (who is actually Gill\u2019s same age). pic.twitter.com\/Ydduqqw0dC While Gill may have the same number of shares as Cohen did back then, he doesn\u2019t have the same influence. That\u2019s because the retailer has since executed a four-to-one stock split along with two recent at-the-market offerings that combined inflated the shares in circulation by nearly 40%, or 120 million. According to a filing this week, Cohen has let his 12% stake from April be diluted to just 8.6% as of\u00a0June 10. By comparison, Gill\u2019s screenshot suggests he controls 2.1% of the shares. GameStop is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday. It was scheduled for yesterday, but adjourned as soon as it began owing to technical difficulties.\u00a0 The company didn\u2019t respond to a request from\u00a0Fortune\u00a0for comment. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Too much TV may be cutting your lifespan","url":"https:\/\/fortune.com\/well\/2024\/06\/14\/sorry-netflix-binge-watchers-too-much-tv-lifespan\/","description":"A new study finds an increase of two hours of sitting and watching TV was associated with a 12% deduction in the chances of healthy aging.","date":"2024-06-14T14:00:00Z","content":"There\u2019s nothing quite like going horizontal on the couch and turning on a mindless reality show after a long day of work.\u00a0Not to burst your guilty pleasure bubble, but new research has associated less TV time with healthier aging.\u00a0 A study published this week in the journal JAMA Network examined two decades of data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study\u2014over 45,000 women who were 50 years old or older in 1992. Researchers who analyzed results in 2022 concluded that an additional two hours of sitting and watching TV per day was associated with a 12% decrease in the chances of healthy aging. Healthy aging was defined as those who lived to at least 70 years old without experiencing one or more of 11 major chronic conditions and who were not cognitively or physically impaired (41% of the participants did not have any of the chronic conditions after the 20-year mark).\u00a0 In contrast, adding two hours of light physical activity at work per day was associated with a 6% increase in the chances of healthy aging. Swapping an hour of TV time for light physical activity at work or home also increased odds of healthy aging. Additionally, for those who routinely got less than the recommended minimum seven hours of sleep per night, replacing TV time with rest increased the chances of aging healthfully.\u00a0 The researchers estimate that 61% of non-healthy agers could become ones if they adhered to a combination of lifestyle factors, including watching less than three hours of TV per day, maintaining a healthy weight, and completing at least three hours of light physical activity during work.\u00a0 \u201cGiven the strong association observed between sedentary lifestyle and healthy aging, public health campaigns to promote health should not only promote increasing physical activities, but also decreasing sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged television watching,\u201d the researchers conclude.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s not like you need to chuck your TV out the window altogether and go cold turkey. The results confirm previous studies that show sitting is the new smoking. Research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine last year found that sitting 12 or more hours a day increased people\u2019s mortality risk by 38% compared to those who sat for eight hours a day. The Nurses\u2019 Health Study also highlights that prolonged sitting can reduce insulin sensitivity, which can put people at risk for chronic conditions like diabetes. It can also increase inflammation and reduce blood flow.\u00a0 Therefore, it may be more about sitting and less about your desire to watch Bravo (phew). So, consider setting time limits for how long you sit and watch TV or take a five-minute \u201cexercise snack\u201d break every 30 minutes of sitting. Small bursts of walking can help combat our sedentary lifestyles and significantly reduce blood sugar spikes. Consider having your TV on while you cook or being mindful about binging without moving, no matter how zoned in, especially because many of us are also sitting throughout the workday.\u00a0 Researchers also point out that sitting and watching TV may promote other habits that lead to unhealthy aging, like mindless eating and staying up too late at night. If you can get those in check, set TV limits, or even move around with the TV on, you\u2019re doing yourself a major favor. Two hours of TV time makes a difference, so scaling back can help.\u00a0 \u201cBecause of technological advances, the amount of time adults in industrialized countries like the U.S. spend sitting has been steadily increasing for decades,\u201d Keith Diaz, an associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University, previously wrote in Fortune. \u201cWith the migration to more remote work, people are less inclined to venture out of the house these days. So it\u2019s clear that strategies are needed to combat a growing 21st century public health problem.\u201d Researchers considered socio-economic factors, family health history, sleep, diet, and menopausal factors in the study. However, the study solely analyzed female nurses in the U.S., and the data was self-reported, so there is no universal or causal relationship between TV watching and unhealthy aging.

Big mistake. Huge. The streaming service platform that\u2019s produced films like Titanic 666 and Most Wanted Santa, has at times been the butt of jokes regarding some low-budget original shows and just the name, Tubi.\u00a0 But Tubi is laughing now.\u00a0 This past spring, the free and legal streaming service Tubi raked in a record number of viewers\u2014according to Nielsen data as first reported by the Los Angeles Times. Tubi\u2019s average audience spiked by 46% in one year, reaching 1 million in May. It rose above legacy streamers including Disney+, Peacock, Paramount, and Max, noted the Times.\u00a0 The rise of Tubi can be attributed to the age-old value of a deal. And the best deal of all, of course, is costing nothing. \u201cTubi\u2019s momentum is the result of having a true flywheel in streaming: We\u2019re free (and committed to staying that way),\u201d Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said in a statement to Fortune, adding that the platform has the \u201cworld\u2019s largest content library with a diverse set of stories and storytellers.\u201d Having joined Tubi only in 2023, Sud recognizes that this is baked into Tubi\u2019s style, a model that was \u201cinvested in consistently for over a decade.\u201d \u201cIt is different to be 100% free. We\u2019re not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or to a subscription tier,\u201d Sud said in April on the Ringer\u2019s podcast The Town With Matthew Belloni of the ad-supported streamer\u2019s success.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to upsell you,\u201d she added, noting that it\u2019s \u201cas easy to start watching a movie on Tubi as it is to open up TikTok.\u201d The free nature of Tubi becomes all the more appealing when other platforms are hiking their prices.\u00a0 As every network has rolled out its own one-word streaming service, the market has grown oversaturated and pricey. In 2023, the Wall Street Journal predicted that the cost of watching one of the main ad-free streaming platforms would go up by 25% in a year. Indeed, prices inflated, as Fortune\u2019s Rachyl Jones reported in November; half of major U.S. streaming platforms charged a monthly fee that was twice the price they charged upon first entering the space.\u00a0 Apple increased prices, as did Peacock and Max. Netflix, which recently cracked down on account-sharing (to the chagrin of many), announced that it was set to increase prices again this year. While it experienced record profits during its first quarter, Netflix announced that as of 2025 it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers after a period of slow growth before its password mandate.\u00a0 TV watchers are tired: In November 2023 the monthly churn for major streamers reached 6.3%, an increase from 5.1% the previous year\u2014per subscriptions analytics group Antenna. And when the iron is lukewarm, that\u2019s when Tubi strikes. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing our value proposition resonate even more today with a highly engaged audience who are majority cord-cutters and cord-nevers,\u201d Sud tells Fortune. She told the Ringer that the group that doesn\u2019t pay for cable represents 60% of the Tubi audience. \u201cWe see our momentum as good validation of our strategy, and will continue to lean into our strengths and skate where the puck is going,\u201d she added, noting that 40% of Tubi\u2019s viewership are \u201cnot on other traditional streamers.\u201d Another key strength for Tubi is its extensive catalog of over 240,000 movies and TV shows, according to its CEO. Its viewers are not looking for Oscar winners, Sud notes. Rather, its younger audience \u201ccare[s] more about authenticity than critical acclaim.\u201d\u00a0 And Sud is focused on that core base which doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel as represented in the prestige content you see today.\u201d Indeed, Tubi tilts young, as the Ringer\u2019s Belloni points out, almost half its audience is between ages 13 and 30. Around half of the platform\u2019s viewership identifies as multicultural (which includes Black, Latino, Asian, and LGBTQ+ users), the Los Angeles Times noted.\u00a0 These young users, who are more likely to be economically vulnerable and therefore more impacted by inflation, might find the allure of a free platform more striking as they\u2019re forced out of the main streaming platforms. They\u2019re also just watching TV differently.\u00a0\u00a0 Free and accessible might win the game, if Tubi\u2019s story becomes legend. \u201cUltimately we\u2019re not competing with fast or streaming\u2014we\u2019re competing with social and gaming and anything someone chooses to spend their time being entertained by,\u201d Sud says. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Guests enjoyed a meal of broccoli, cauliflower, black lentils, and nutty pudding\u2014a concoction including walnuts, macadamia nuts, pomegranate juice, berries, and cinnamon. And in true Johnson fashion\u2014because sleep needs to be optimized, too\u2014the dinner wrapped up at 7:30 that evening.\u00a0\u00a0 Johnson, who says he\u2019s aging at a rate of 0.64 years for every chronological year and celebrates his birthday every 19 months, shared Instagram and TikTok videos from the gathering. Members of the Kardashian family, including Khlo\u00e9, Kim, and Kris, sat alongside Johnson, plastic surgeon Dr. Jason Diamond, and podcast host Andrew Huberman. The group enjoyed a meal together, followed by a photoshoot.\u00a0 Many were confused by this guest list and flocked to comment: It was \u201cthe collab nobody asked for\u201d and looked like an \u201cAI-generated evening,\u201d according to two commenters. Another asked, \u201cWhere is my invite, Bryan?\u201d\u00a0 Hosted a Don\u2019t Die dinner w @Kim Kardashian @Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian @Kris @Andrew Huberman @Dr Jason diamond @Kate Tolo  How did Johnson assemble such an eclectic group of high-profile people? \u201cThey organically form among friends of friends,\u201d Johnson tells Fortune. He also notes that he cannot discuss what anyone said during the dinner in order to maintain their privacy.\u00a0 Johnson has hosted biweekly \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d dinners for the last few years, and has welcomed hundreds of guests\u2014including politicians, astronauts, artists, and scientists, he says. Johnson says the impetus for the dinners is to provoke conversations about what it means to be human. \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d is \u201cthe punchline of the dinner,\u201d he says.\u00a0 He tries to embody the phrase everyday by doing everything he can to optimize his health. \u201cFor me to even begin to imagine that I get to predict my life expectancy would be insane. We can\u2019t see past a year, two, or three years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing I do know is we need to build systems that don\u2019t die as a society.\u201d\u00a0 The food served at the dinner is what Johnson eats daily, which is designed by his team of doctors who help curate his Blueprint\u2014a specific lifestyle plan and regimen for exercise, supplements, and more.\u00a0 Johnson says he begins every \u2018Don\u2019t Die\u2019 dinner with two questions.\u00a0 \u201cI say, if you had access to an algorithm that can give you the best physical, mental, and spiritual health of your life, but in exchange for access to the algorithm, you would have\u00a0to go to bed when it said, and you would exercise in the way it said, would you say yes or would you say no?\u201d\u00a0 Next, he asks people to think about the 25th century and how future people will think about the morals, ethics, and norms of today. \u201cThe next question invites introspection and contemplation of who we are in this moment,\u201d he says.\u00a0 The Kardashian family, known for their beauty brands, have been eager adopters of new technology aimed at keeping their insides as healthy as their exteriors. They\u2019re part of the trend of wealthy longevity enthusiasts who are buying and promoting subscriptions and tests that claim to indicate how well you are aging or promise longer lifespans. Kim Kardashian was among the first supporters of Prenuvo\u2019s full-body MRI scan, which aims to spot early signs of disease, sharing the experience with her over 360 million Instagram followers.\u00a0 While a dinner over nutty pudding and longevity-themed conversation is harmless, critics have posed concerns about Johnson\u2019s methods and about the emerging field of longevity science.\u00a0 Whole-body MRI\u2019s, for example, are not recommended by the American Academy of Radiology for preventative purposes as there is insufficient evidence to back up their efficacy. The longevity science field is also fairly new, and experts have cautioned that some longevity science is just pseudoscience. Johnson has come under fire for experimenting with approaches not FDA approved like swapping blood with his teenage son. Still, he is all in on the mindset of biohacking his way to a longer life and says he does not promote his $333-a-month Blueprint protocol at the dinners (although anyone is welcome to sign up).\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t Die\u2019 is the most commonly played game by every human on the planet,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAs a species, we love games. I think \u2018Don\u2019t Die\u2019 could basically be the next game we play.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

But you're helping people tap into their highest self for their journey.\"","date":"2024-06-14T20:43:33Z","content":"Ashley Branton has earned a living as a psychic medium for seven years, helping a growing number of people with heavy choices about toxic relationships, home purchases and cross-country moves. And while the tarot cards are never wrong, she said, they didn\u2019t see this one coming. The City Council in Norfolk, Virginia, repealed a 45-year-old ban this week on \u201cthe practice of palmistry, palm reading, phrenology or clairvoyance, for monetary or other compensation.\u201d Soothsaying, it turned out, had been a first-degree misdemeanor and carried up to a year in jail. \u201cI had no idea that was even a thing,\u201d Branton said with a laugh Thursday among the crystals in her Norfolk shop, Velvet Witch, where she also performs tarot readings and psychic healings. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s never come down on me.\u201d It\u2019s unclear exactly why this city of 230,000 people on the Chesapeake Bay, home to the nation\u2019s largest Navy base, nullified the 1979 ordinance. Versions of the ban had existed for decades before. Norfolk spokeswoman Kelly Straub said in an email that it was repealed \u201cbecause it is no longer used.\u201d City Council members said little during their vote Tuesday, although one joked that \u201csomebody out there predicted that this was going to pass.\u201d Jokes aside, the city\u2019s repeal comes as the psychic services industry is growing in the U.S., generating an estimated $2.3 billion in revenue last year and employing 97,000 people, according to a 2023 report from market research firm IBIS World. In late 2017, a Pew Research Center survey found that most American adults identify as Christians. But many also hold New Age beliefs, with 4 in 10 believing in the power of psychics. A 2009 survey for the Pew Research Center\u2019s Religion & Public Life Project found about 1 in 7 Americans had consulted a psychic. Branton, 42, who previously worked as a makeup artist, said the market is expanding for psychic mediums because social media has fueled awareness. An aversion to organized religion also plays a role, along with the nation\u2019s divisive politics and a growing sense of uncertainty, particularly among millennials and younger generations. \u201cEver since COVID, people have been carrying this weight. They\u2019re just carrying so much,\u201d Branton said. \u201cAnd people are starting to do inner work,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to take care of their mental health. And they\u2019re starting to take care of the spiritual aspect.\u201d Branton said she considers her work a calling. Psychic gifts run in her family, and she\u2019s had them her whole life. \u201cI always had interactions with spirits,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been an empath. I can feel people\u2019s energies.\u201d Branton said she\u2019s built up her clientele through word of mouth, without any advertising. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be scammers and people out here doing this for just the money. Obviously, this is my way of living now. But it was never about money for me.\u201d In 2022, AARP warned of scam psychics who prey on \u201cpeople who are grieving, lonely or struggling emotionally, physically or financially.\u201d And some bans remain in place. In October, the police chief in Hanover, Pennsylvania, told a witchcraft-themed store that any complaints about tarot card readings would prompt an investigation,\u00a0The New York Times reported. The police chief cited an old state law that makes it illegal to predict the future for money. In 2007, the city of Philadelphia cited the same law when it shut down more than a dozen psychics, astrologers and tarot-card readers,\u00a0The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Fortune telling bans stemmed from anti-witchcraft and anti-vagrancy laws in 18th century England, said Charles McCrary, a professor of religious studies at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. The American laws took hold in the mid-19th century, an era of growing concern about fraudulent business practices, McCrary said. But the Spiritualism movement, which often involved channeling the dead, was also growing in popularity, particularly among the middle and upper classes. \u201cThere was something about these white, Spiritualist women that I think troubled a lot of people,\u201d McCrary said. \u201cPart of what made it threatening was it couldn\u2019t be written off as something that poor people do or something for the marginal,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was very popular. And so more mainstream Christians found it especially threatening. And a lot of people were Christians who also did seances.\u201d Such laws faced little scrutiny from the courts at first, said David L. Hudson, a law professor at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and a fellow with the Freedom Forum think tank in Washington. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld a state law in 1928 that regulated fortune telling, writing that \u201cliberty of speech is not license to speak anything that one pleases freed from all criminal or civil responsibility.\u201d Other courts reasoned that fortune telling was commercial speech, which received no First Amendment protection until the mid-1970s. More recently, courts have increasingly viewed bans on fortune tellers with skepticism on First Amendment grounds. Maryland\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that fortune telling for a fee is protected free speech. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way, both in terms of social norms and social acceptance,\u201d Hudson told The Associated Press, likening psychic readings to tattoos. \u201dBut also there\u2019s been a massive development of First Amendment law \u2026 It\u2019s very disfavored to entirely ban a medium of expression.\u201d Even though Norfolk\u2019s ban was practically forgotten and no longer enforced, Carol Peterson is relieved about the repeal. She owns the Crystal Sunflower, a store in Norfolk that offers tarot card readings and vibrational sound therapy. She is also a civilian geologist for the military. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I could get a class one misdemeanor,\u2019\u201d Peterson said. \u201cPeople have this misconceived notion that tarot is evil or demonic,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cBut you\u2019re helping people tap into their highest self for their journey. And if people would be more curious instead of judgmental, I think that they would be pleasantly surprised.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

It also risked setting a dangerous precedent whereby countries might take control of the assets of geopolitical rivals, a scenario of particular concern among European leaders. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen favored seizure and liquidation of the Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s rebuilding effort.\u00a0 Under the current plan, the Russian assets wouldn\u2019t change hands. Instead, Ukraine receives a lump sum payment from the United States and the European Union. The U.S. in particular pushed for this arrangement because it wanted to ensure Ukraine had enough funding to sustain it for the long term. The loans would be backed by the interest generated from the Russian assets, and the interest would also be used to pay the loans back over time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRussian immobilized assets should be used for defending the lives of Ukranians from Russian terror and for repaying the damage the aggressor caused to Ukraine,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cIt\u2019s fair and absolutely right.\u201d\u00a0 A notable portion of the funding will go toward reserve brigades, according to Zelensky. This would allow Ukrainian soldiers currently on the battlefield to be relieved by rested brigades that would also have newer equipment. This would \u201craise morale, but also the raise of strength of our brigades,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The remaining portions of the loan will be used to fund munitions development in Ukrainian territory so its army can manufacture some armaments on its own, to rebuild critical infrastructure, and to shore up its national budget. Countries that provide funding to the loan will have some flexibility in where exactly they can direct their contributions, a U.S. official told the BBC. Some countries \u201cprefer to send their money to budget support and to reconstruction\u201d rather than just military support, the official said.\u00a0\u00a0 The exact structure of the loan was subject to its own round of debates between European and U.S. officials. European countries wanted to give Ukraine $3 billion a year with the money coming only from the interest generated by the Russian assets. Meanwhile the U.S. sought to give the Ukrainians a major cash infusion upfront\u2014NPR reported it was as much as $60 billion\u2014to fund their war effort. Ultimately the heated negotiations ended up with the current shape of the deal, in which Ukraine would receive $50 billion from the U.S.-led consortium, but without fully seizing the Russian assets.\u00a0 One of the key priorities for the U.S. was to ensure that Ukraine gets the money quickly. The need to ensure a speedy disbursement became even more apparent after a group of Republican members of Congress held up $61 billion in Ukraine funding earlier this year, which significantly hampered the Ukrainian war effort. The plan is for Ukraine to get the money by the end of this year, an unnamed member of France\u2019s delegation told the Associated Press. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The\u00a0University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, released Friday in a preliminary version, dropped to 65.6 this month from a final reading of 69.1 in May. June\u2019s reading is about 30% higher than the bottom reached in June 2022, when inflation peaked at a four-decade high, but is still below levels typically associated with a healthy economy. Consumers\u2019 outlook has generally been gloomy since the pandemic and particularly after inflation first spiked in 2021. Consumer spending is a crucial driver of growth. Sour sentiment about the economy is also weighing on\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid. The University of Michigan\u2019s index moved higher last winter and spring, reaching a recent peak of 79.4 in March and raising hopes that American shoppers were taking a more optimistic view of the economy as inflation faded. Yet those gains have now all reversed, as inflation remained stubbornly high in the first three months of this year. Data released this week, however, shows\u00a0inflation cooled substantially\u00a0in May, as the cost of gasoline, new cars, and even car insurance fell. Consumer spending is watched closely at the Federal Reserve and by economists, as it drives most economic activity in the U.S. Consumers spent at a healthy clip in the first three months of the year, propping up an economy that otherwise slowed in the first quarter. Spending did slow in April, after adjusting for inflation, though Americans continue to shell out for travel, restaurants, and concerts and sporting events. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The Department of Labor received the email and three days later forwarded it to an FDA address specifically for such complaints. But one of several staff members charged with managing the FDA inbox at the time \u201cinadvertently archived\u201d the email in February 2021, and it wasn\u2019t found until a reporter requested it in June 2022. The episode is one of several that led the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General\u00a0to conclude\u00a0in a report Thursday that the FDA\u2019s policies and procedures to address the issues at the Abbott plant were inadequate. The FDA took some actions and did follow-up inspections but \u201cmore could have been done leading up to the Abbott powdered infant formula recall,\u201d the auditors wrote. The FDA needs better policies for reporting the status of complaints to senior leaders and to make sure that inspections are done quickly, the report concluded. \u201cThe key is, moving forward, FDA should be doing better, and the American public should expect better,\u201d Assistant Inspector General Carla Lewis said in an interview. Several infants were hospitalized, and two died, of a rare bacterial infection after being fed the powdered formula made at Abbott\u2019s Michigan plant, the nation\u2019s largest. The FDA shuttered the site\u00a0for several months\u00a0starting in February 2022, and the company\u00a0recalled several lots\u00a0of popular formulas including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare. FDA inspectors eventually uncovered a host of violations at the plant, including bacterial contamination, a leaky roof and lax safety protocols, but the agency never found a direct link between the infections and the formula. The new report also found it took 102 days for the FDA to inspect the factory after receiving a different whistleblower complaint in October 2021. In that time, the agency received two complaints \u2014 one of an illness and another of a death \u2014 among infants who consumed formula from the plant, but formula samples were negative for cronobacter, the bacteria in question. The FDA said in a statement that it agreed with the inspector general\u2019s conclusions. In its own 2022 report,\u00a0the agency acknowledged\u00a0that its response was slowed by delays in processing a whistleblower complaint and factory test samples. \u201cIt should be noted that the OIG\u2019s evaluation represents a snapshot in time, and the FDA continues to make progress,\u201d an FDA spokesperson said. The FDA established a \u201ccritical foods investigator cadre, which will solely focus on the inspection and oversight of the infant formula (and other critical foods) industry,\u201d the spokesperson said. It also started improving how it tracks hard-copy mail items, which can include complaints, the FDA said. Dr. Steven Abrams, a pediatrics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said he agreed with the report\u2019s recommendations, which include that Congress should give the FDA the power to require manufacturers report any test showing infant formula contamination, even if the product doesn\u2019t leave the factory. \u201cLike anything else, there were mistakes made. But the government is working very hard, including the FDA. It\u2019s fixing the gaps that existed,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cPeople have to be comfortable with the safety of powdered infant formula.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

He was caught in a sting operation after undercover agents posed as Long Island businesspeople looking to buy an assembly line at a trade show in Las Vegas. Klaus Pflugbeil, 58, is now facing a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and he\u2019ll be sentenced in October. His co-defendant, Yilong Shao, is still at large. Prosecutors said Pflugbeil and Shao were employees of a Canada-based manufacturing company that made and sold battery assembly lines for clients that needed alkaline and lithium-ion batteries. The Canada manufacturing firm was purchased by a company\u2014identified in reports as Tesla\u2014which gave the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker a leg up in continuous motion battery manufacturing. \u201cDespite Pflugbeil\u2019s agreement to protect what he knew was proprietary, sensitive technology, he chose to abscond with these trade secrets to China, where he sought an unfair and illegal advantage in critical industries such as electric vehicle manufacturing,\u201d assistant attorney general Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division said in a statement. The conduct jeopardized national security, said Olsen. The assembly lines allow manufacturers to run battery production at high speeds without pausing and can produce five to 10 times more parts per minute than competitors that don\u2019t have access to it, court documents state. Between 2004 and 2017, Tesla spent about $13 million on research and development to bring the battery technology to life. Because it was top secret and valuable to competitors, information about the battery assembly such as drawings and diagrams were stored on one particular server under the direct control of a dedicated in-house IT team. Few employees had access to the drive with the battery assembly information, the indictment states, and Pflugbeil was one of them, authorities said. He worked for the Canadian manufacturer for 12 years from January 1997 to June 2009, including two years as the head of its office in China. Around the time Tesla bought the Canadian manufacturing firm, Shao sent Pflugbeil a proposal about setting up a business together, the court docs say.\u00a0\u00a0 Pflugbeil and Shao knew the continuous motion battery assembly information was secret and that Pflugbeil took original company documents when he left in 2009, according to the DOJ. The duo set about copying the documents and drawings from the battery manufacturer and marketing their business as an alternative source for products that rely on the battery assembly. Between 2019 and 2022, authorities say Pflugbeil sent dozens of direct messages on LinkedIn claiming to sell spare parts and precision pumps. Pflugbeil also set up a YouTube account for the business and when a commenter on a video inquired about the assembly, Pflugbeil responded that his new company provided direct sales and technical support for the pumps and assembly pieces. The duo also bought ads on Google for its business, which were shown tens of thousands of times, authorities said. The two were caught when in 2023, undercover law enforcement agents went to a trade show in Las Vegas and posed as Long Island business owners interested in buying a battery assembly line. Pflugbeil wasn\u2019t there but Shao was and said the company was interested. Pflugbeil later sent a 66-page document to undercover agents, the indictment says, with at least half a dozen drawings that belonged to Tesla. Pflugbeil flew to New York in 2024 to seal what he thought was a deal to sell an assembly line, but instead he met with undercover agents in Long Island.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis blatant theft of advanced trade secrets relating to battery components and assembly blunts America\u2019s technological edge, and the Justice Department will hold accountable those who would so try cheat our country of its economic potential and threaten our national security,\u201d said Olsen. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

So it\u2019s worth noting that O\u2019Leary, eyeing a $108 million bonus, is actively opposing what will be the next big cash windfall for his budget airline.\u00a0 The CEO of Europe\u2019s busiest carrier is preparing for higher revenues this winter thanks to a unique passenger cap at Ryanair\u2019s primary airport. But if you believe O\u2019Leary, it\u2019s apparently the last thing he wants. Dublin Airport has a 32 million annual cap on passengers. The cap was put in place in 2007 to allow the airport to gain planning permission for a second terminal and an extension to its first terminal.\u00a0 The airport applied to Fingal Council last year to extend this cap to 40 million passengers. However, the council pushed back, asking for reams of extra information in February and giving Dublin Airport six months to reply.\u00a0 This means Dublin Airport, which effectively hit its cap last year with 31,908,471 passengers, cannot expand its passenger numbers until it gains permission to increase that cap. It also means that prices for flights will inevitably rise as passengers compete for seats. A representative for Fingal Council didn\u2019t immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment. This, O\u2019Leary thinks, is untenable given the airport has the capacity for 60 million passengers per year thanks to a \u20ac300 million ($324 million) second runway that opened in 2022. He also suggested it would take four years for the cap to be lifted. Speaking at the Oireachtas Transport Committee, O\u2019Leary warned that Ryanair would \u201cmake out like bandits\u201d this winter as a result, charging up to \u20ac500 ($540) for one-way fares and \u20ac1,000 ($1,080) for return trips.\u00a0 \u201cI will make a fortune this Christmas,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, according to several media reports. Additionally, O\u2019Leary warned that as Ryanair grows, the benefits would bypass the airline\u2019s home of Dublin. It appears he would rather keep the budget airline\u2019s prices low and accommodate more passengers. While O\u2019Leary\u2019s frustration at receiving up to $1,080 from hamstrung customers might be a boon to Ryanair\u2019s coffers, there is an obvious alternative financial motivation to lobby for increased passengers.\u00a0 O\u2019Leary is set for a \u20ac100 million ($108 million) bonus if he can keep Ryanair\u2019s share price above \u20ac21 for 28 days. It briefly hit that target through April but not for the minimum required period. A jump to the passenger cap at Ryanair\u2019s airport would go a long way to helping O\u2019Leary get his payday. O\u2019Leary also lamented \u201ca couple of Nimbys in north county Dublin\u201d for local opposition in the form of a bizarre stream of noise complaints. Dublin Airport received more than 26,000 noise complaints from locals in 2022, putting pressure on the local council to suppress growth. However, it was revealed that one person was solely responsible for 23,431 of those complaints. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Dispensing with the usual custom of waiting until polls were closed and ballots tabulated, Musk took to his social media platform, X, to declare victory for both his personal compensation, once an estimated $55 billion,\u00a0as well as a move of the company\u2019s legal domicile from\u00a0Delaware to Texas.\u00a0 \u201cBoth Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!\u201d he tweeted hours before the start of the annual shareholder meeting, posting graphs showing their approval above the minimum threshold required. \u201cThanks for your support!\u201d\u00a0 The saga around his compensation deal opened up deep divisions in the once closely knit investor base. It pitted supporters of the company\u2019s visionary yet often\u00a0distracted\u00a0CEO against a growing minority that felt Musk had become too much of a liability now that Tesla\u2019s\u00a0halcyon days\u00a0of 50% growth were\u00a0over. Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins!\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Thanks for your support!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f pic.twitter.com\/udf56VGQdo In the run-up, Tesla mounted an\u00a0unprecedented campaign\u00a0to lobby on his behalf, with critics like asset manager Gerber Kawasaki\u00a0suggesting\u00a0the company spent more on advertising for its CEO\u2019s pay package than it did for its own cars.\u00a0 Musk effectively turned the shareholder meeting into an\u00a0all-or-nothing confidence vote\u00a0that risked undermining his authority and that of the entire board should the vote not go their way.\u00a0 Big institutional shareholders like CalPERS, the largest manager of public pension assets in the U.S., and Norway\u2019s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund pledged to oppose Musk, while other long-term investors like Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price supported him.\u00a0 The two big unknowns going into today\u2019s meeting were how the major index funds like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street might vote, as well as how many of Musk\u2019s\u00a0retail shareholders\u00a0would actually cast their ballot remotely via a dedicated website. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018pop the Champagne\u2019 moment for Musk and Tesla shareholders,\u201d wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives in a research note to clients on Thursday. \u201cThis removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the stock, in our opinion, that has weighed on shares since the head-scratching Delaware ruling set this Twilight Zone soap opera on earlier this year.\u201d\u00a0 With uncertainty over the vote now removed, shares are set to open more than 6% higher on Thursday at $189 each, their highest level since May 21. At the time the compensation deal was first conceived six years ago, it was a high-stakes gamble that in lieu of a salary gave Musk the right to buy up to 304 million shares at a steep discount should he achieve more than dozen milestones.\u00a0 Although overwhelmingly approved at the time and subsequently met in full, it was\u00a0struck down\u00a0in January by a Delaware court on the basis that Musk\u2019s friends and family on the board had failed to reveal to shareholders they gave him wide berth to set his own terms.\u00a0 Re-ratifying the package won\u2019t change the ruling, expected to be challenged by Tesla on appeal. But it does lend credence to his legal team\u2019s argument that investors are now sufficiently informed about the scale of their company\u2019s governance issues.\u00a0 There were good reasons for investors to ratify the deal at this year\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting. Chief among them was the risk that Musk could simply fly the coop. The volatile entrepreneur is known for his take-no-prisoners \u201cdemon mode,\u201d during which he tends to make\u00a0extreme decisions. Resigning was a distinct possibility as losing the vote would have suggested that he no longer enjoyed the support of a majority of his investors. While some believed this could be a blessing in disguise, the risk is, without Musk, Tesla would lose its hunger to disrupt the industry, much like when Apple kicked out Steve Jobs.\u00a0 Exacerbating this risk was the lack of an obvious successor who enjoyed the broad confidence of Tesla\u2019s investors. Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla\u2019s widely respected finance chief, and engineer Drew Baglino, the senior vice president for powertrain and energy, were both pushed out of the company in recent months.\u00a0 The only obvious candidate with the requisite standing at hand is nonexecutive director JB Straubel, Tesla\u2019s chief technology officer until 2019. This is just one reason why the likely appeal of the Delaware decision could still fail: Today\u2019s approval could be construed as having been made under duress. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t fully settle the matter,\u201d warned Piper Sandler analyst Alex Potter on Thursday. \u201cThe compensation package can still be deemed illegal.\u201d Even if the polarizing entrepreneur did stay on in the event of a no vote, there was another major downside facing shareholders. While a new contract would likely be more legally watertight than the porous one shareholders just revoted, it would have meant months of negotiation to reach a costly outcome. That\u2019s because the stock-based compensation for the previous deal has already long been fully expensed and financially digested.\u00a0 Were Musk to demand so much as a tenth of the original 304 million shares under his previous package, the company faced potentially billions in new accounting costs as the value would have to be adjusted to today\u2019s stock price rather than those back in 2018, when Tesla was still struggling to prove it could survive. The hope is now that the company can put this acrimonious affair behind it and move forward as a team to deliver on its strategic pivot away from selling EVs to\u00a0AI and robotics. Major challenges lie ahead. With Musk dashing any hopes of a refreshed Model Y for this year, responsible for two-thirds of all car sales, hopes rest on the Aug. 8 robo-taxi unveiling, where Tesla could also present its latest and most affordable\u00a0entry model.\u00a0 If that doesn\u2019t convince, it could be a trying time for investors. Company officials that recently briefed JPMorgan warned the bank\u2019s analysts not to expect the robo-taxi to go into production\u00a0until 2027. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

His arms stretched wide over his head as he hopped in jubilation.\u00a0 The galvanized Musk had just been re-granted his $46 billion pay plan that a Delaware judge had previously voided. Tesla shareholders voted to reinstate the package, which the company\u2019s board had lobbied for them to do, and signed off on moving its state of incorporation to Texas.\u00a0 \u201cI just want to start off by saying hot damn, I love you guys,\u201d Musk told Tesla\u2019s shareholders at the meeting in Austin and those on the live stream.\u00a0 HOT DAMN I LOVE YOU GUYS! \u2665\ufe0f\u4e00 Elon Musk pic.twitter.com\/mIt1fZ9Qi3 Immediately after the preliminary vote results were announced, the crowd in attendance erupted into applause. Shareholders were then treated to a sizzle reel touting Tesla\u2019s achievements in sustainability, new product lineups, and its innovation pipeline, which includes fully self-driving cars and a line of humanoid robots called Optimus. The video opened with voiceovers of some of Tesla\u2019s harshest critics. \u201cTesla could go bust,\u201d boomed the voice of investor Per Lekander, a noted Tesla bear.\u00a0 In the video Musk brushed away these criticisms, as he would just minutes later with characteristic confidence in his live presentation. In his remarks Musk outlined his vision for the future of Tesla, which hinges on its ability to deliver fully autonomous vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re not just opening a new chapter for Tesla\u2014we\u2019re starting a new book,\u201d Musk declared.\u00a0\u00a0 Tesla has a bright financial future, according to Musk. \u201cI think just based on vehicle autonomy, we can we can 110x the value of the company,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what will happen.\u201d At least one investor agreed with his towering projection. ARK Invest, the fund managed by longtime backer Cathie Wood, said it believed Tesla could reach an $8 trillion market cap. Wood\u2019s firm issued a whopping $2,600 price target for Tesla in 2029. The analysis banked on self-driving cars turning its revenue model and profit margins into those of a software company. \u201cThis becomes a recurring revenue model, a slice of every mile driven on that autonomous taxi network,\u201d Wood told CNBC Thursday morning prior to the vote.\u00a0 In the past, Musk has said that once Tesla completes its self-driving software the company will immediately upload it to all its vehicles currently in the market. Doing so could, virtually overnight, create a fleet of self-driving cars all potentially sharing revenues with Tesla. The plan often overlooks the role regulators would have to play in allowing the move to happen.\u00a0 \u201cReally the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet,\u201d Musk said on an earnings call in April. \u201cIt might be the biggest asset value appreciation in history when that happens, when you can do unsupervised, full self-driving.\u201d Musk excoriated many investors for failing to understand the significance of Tesla\u2019s plans. He singled out institutional investors who live in New York because \u201cthey don\u2019t drive cars.\u201d\u00a0 The fleet would be monetized by emulating the business models of both Uber and Airbnb, said Musk. Like Uber, Tesla would offer a rideshare service\u2014this time with no driver. Although, crucially Uber does not own the fleet of cars it uses, as Musk proposed Tesla would. Once autonomous Teslas become a reality, Musk predicted people would turn their cars into temporary taxis, just like Airbnb lets users turn their homes into a hotel.\u00a0 If you\u2019re \u201cgoing away for a week, just one tap on your Tesla app,\u201d Musk said to cheers from the audience. \u201cYour car gets added to the fleet and it just makes money for you while you\u2019re gone.\u201d Musk hailed these changes as \u201csimply a matter of time.\u201d In the past he has overpromised on several critical elements of Tesla\u2019s business, something he\u2019s done at his many other ventures. In 2016, Musk claimed that self-driving cars would be available by 2018\u2014a promise that he is still making to this day. He predicted that by 2020 there would be a million robo-taxis on the road. While there are some robo-taxis in a few cities, they are hardly a ubiquitous mode of transportation.\u00a0 This time around, Musk seemed to couch his predictions with some caveats.\u00a0 \u201cNow admittedly, I\u2019m a little optimistic sometimes,\u201d Musk said \u201cSo I don\u2019t have a complete lack of self-awareness.\u201d\u00a0 Still on his victory lap though, he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cBut if I wasn\u2019t optimistic, this wouldn\u2019t exist, this factory wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The hefty one-time payments, known as broker fees, are ubiquitous in New York but nearly unheard of anywhere else. In most other cities, landlords cover the commission of agents working on their behalf. But\u00a0legislation\u00a0backed by a majority of the New York City Council would require landlords who hire brokers to pay their fees, marking a potential sea change in one of the country\u2019s most expensive housing markets. Renters, who make up more than two-thirds of city households, are hailing the latest attempt at reform. At a hearing Wednesday, many New Yorkers recalled paying exorbitant fees to brokers who appeared to do little more than open a door to an apartment or direct them to a lockbox. \u201cIn most businesses, the person who hires the person pays the person,\u201d said Agustina Velez, a house cleaner from Queens who said she recently paid $6,000 to switch apartments. \u201cEnough with these injustices. Landlords have to pay for the services they use.\u201d But the proposal has triggered fierce opposition from New York\u2019s real estate industry. Ahead of the hearing, hundreds of brokers gathered to voice their objections at a rally organized by the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry\u2019s powerful lobbying group. Through hours of testimony, they warned the legislation would sow chaos in the rental market and decimate the livelihoods of the city\u2019s roughly 25,000 real estate agents. Many predicted landlords would pass on the costs of paying brokers to tenants through increased rents or keep apartments off the market altogether. \u201cThis is the start of a top-down government-controlled housing system,\u201d said Jordan Silver, a broker with the firm Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cThe language is so incredibly vague we actually have no idea what this would look like in the world.\u201d The bill\u2019s sponsor, City Councilman Chi Oss\u00e9, has said he was\u00a0moved\u00a0to act following a recent apartment search that was \u201ctiring, treacherous, and competitive.\u201d Another local official, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, testified that he\u2019d once paid a $2,500 fee to a broker he never met. Their frustration was echoed at Wednesday\u2019s hearing by dozens of ordinary renters, along with a mix of labor unions, housing policy groups and some prominent business leaders. Critics said paying brokers\u2019 fees serves as a barrier to those who\u2019d otherwise move to the city while preventing low-income New Yorkers from relocating to new homes. Such broker fees were previously banned in 2020 under a package of renter protection laws passed by the state. But they were quickly reinstated following a lawsuit led by the Real Estate Board of New York. Brokerage firms estimate that roughly half of the city\u2019s apartments require a tenant-paid broker fee. The price of those fees can vary widely, though the standard amount is 15% of the annual rent. For the average apartment in Manhattan, where the median monthly rent recently hit $4,500, that would amount to a fee of $8,100. Under the legislation, tenants would still pay brokers that they hired directly. The bill\u2019s brief language \u2014 less than 200 words \u2014 only requires the party that hires the real estate agent pay their fee. \u201cHow the market works is not as simple as a few sentences, which is what the bill is,\u201d said Ryan Monell, a vice president at the Real Estate Board of New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a misnomer to compare New York to other cities. This is really an exceptional market.\u201d Brokers are adamant that their jobs are far more intensive than merely opening the door to tenants. Many said they help put together listings, review applications, answer questions posed by tenants and arrange tours at all hours of the day. But some also acknowledged that the current system favors landlords. \u201cI think it\u2019s not logical. The landlord should pay the listing agent who is working on their behalf,\u201d said Maria Octavio, a real estate broker with the firm of Douglas Elliman. \u201cBecause it\u2019s worked this way for many years, the owners are used to it.\u201d Anna Klenkar, a broker at Sotheby\u2019s, said the industry group \u2014 known as REBNY \u2014 had contacted her employer after learning that she planned to testify Wednesday in support of the legislation. \u201cIt feels less like we\u2019re protecting ourselves, and more like we\u2019re protecting landlords, whom REBNY also represents,\u201d she testified. A spokesperson for REBNY did not respond to an emailed inquiry about whether they had reached out to the employer. Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, warned the bill could have unintended consequences. He had strong real estate industry backing during his campaign and moonlighted decades ago as a real estate agent while working in the city\u2019s police department. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The latest move will be the first time the country is making that much of a dent in the Greek Loan Facility.\u00a0 \u201cWe actually did a lot since we were reelected\u201d last year, he said in a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday at the prime minister\u2019s office in Athens. \u201cWhen it comes to the market transactions, they probably exceeded expectations.\u201d The move, which covers loan amortizations from 2026 to 2028, is a confident signal to financial markets about the country\u2019s ongoing economic recovery. Even though the government lowered its growth target for 2024 to 2.5% from a previous estimate of 2.9%, the country is performing well above the average growth forecasts in the European Union.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a real appetite for Greek assets,\u201d he added. \u201cThe market seemed to believe our long-term goal story and also believe that this government is stable and here to stay in the long term.\u201d\u00a0 Under Mitsotakis, who won a new term last year, Greece has clawed its way back to an investment-grade rating, but still has plenty of work to do. Debt as a percentage of economic output still remains one of the highest in Europe, though it\u2019s expected to decline to 152.7% of GDP this year from a high of 207% in 2020. The Greek premier said the trends will continue. The country\u2019s net debt decreased in nominal terms in 2023, not just as a percent of output, and \u201cI think it\u2019ll probably fall again this year,\u201d he said. Part of the funds to make the early repayment will come from the country\u2019s cash buffer, which was built up during the debt crisis as a safety net. Now that the bailout era is over, Athens has access to debt markets and Mitsotakis said he plans to use \u20ac5 billion of these funds to make the early repayments.\u00a0 The center-right government has pledged to achieve a primary surplus \u2014 an index that shows revenues minus spending excluding interest payments \u2014 of 2.1% of gross domestic product this year and in 2025. The measure was 1.9% in 2023.\u00a0 Mitsotakis\u2019s administration is taking advantage of the positive momentum and has moved forward with the privatization initiatives. Since October, the state has completely divested its holdings in three big lenders and is now preparing to sell all or part of its remaining stake in National Bank of Greece SA.\u00a0 The state still holds a 18% in National Bank and we\u2019ll do something \u201ccome fall, subject to market conditions,\u201d the Greek prime minister said, without providing further details.\u00a0 In February, the government also concluded its biggest\u00a0initial public offering\u00a0in decades with the listing of a minority stake in Athens International Airport SA.\u00a0 In December, Greece and Latsis Group sold a combined 11% stake in Helleniq Energy Holdings SA for \u20ac235.3 million, and Mitsotakis said there are \u201cno immediate plans\u201d for any further sale in the company. Taking advantage of the rebound in tourism following the Covid-19 pandemic, Greece launched a process to privatize Lavrio Port in March. Close to Athens airport and the popular Cycladic islands, the port is suitable for tourism development with the operation of a cruise terminal and a marina for yachts. Eight groups submitted interest in May to buy a majority stake in the port authority, Regarding Greece\u2019s largest utility Public Power Corp., the premier made clear that the government will hold on to its 34% stake. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the turnaround of the company,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The company boasted big-name interviews, an Emmy-winning TV show, a\u00a0buzzy music and ideas festival\u00a0and impressive numbers to show prospective investors \u2014 until\u00a0it imploded\u00a0in 2021 amid doubts about its audience size, viability and basic integrity. Those doubts are now at the center of a federal criminal trial. Founder Carlos Watson and Ozy are fighting\u00a0charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. Even after numerous other public and court reckonings for Silicon Valley companies that went from ballyhooed to belly-up, it\u2019s hard to forget the moment in Ozy\u2019s downfall when co-founder Samir Rao impersonated a YouTube executive to talk up the company to prospective investors. Watson\u2019s and Ozy\u2019s lawyers blame any misrepresentations solely on Rao, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and to identity theft. The defense also has claimed that prosecutors are casting commonplace entrepreneurial puffery as a crime and singling out Watson, a Black founder in a tech world where African American executives\u00a0have been disproportionately few. \u201cI am not now and never have been a \u2018con man,\u2019\u201d he declared when indicted last year. Prosecutors and Rao, their star witness, say Ozy shredded the line between hopeful hype and bald-faced deceit. \u201cWe told so many lies to so many different people,\u201d Rao testified after recounting how a teetering company concocted rosy financials in a desperate bid to lure investors and stay in business. The hope was to enable \u201ca diverse audience, to consume, hopefully, a different, more meaningful kind of content,\u201d he said. But \u201csurvival within the bonds of decency, fairness, truth, it morphed into survival at all costs and by any means necessary.\u201d Ozy was founded in 2012 on a Millennial-friendly premise of providing a fresh, sophisticated-but-not-stuffy take on politics, culture and more \u2014 billed as \u201cthe new and the next\u201d \u2014 while amplifying minority and marginalized voices. A Harvard and Stanford-educated son of two South Florida teachers, Watson had worked on Wall Street, started and sold a test-prep company and anchored on MSNBC. He conceived of Ozy and then recruited Rao, a former finance-world colleague, after a chance meeting at a Chipotle restaurant in Silicon Valley, according to Rao. Ozy debuted with a website, newsletters and a bang: Former President Bill Clinton was one of its first interviewees. The company expanded into podcasts, events and TV shows, winning a 2020 Emmy for the Watson-hosted \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d on the Oprah Winfrey Network. The annual Ozy Fest in New York\u2019s Central Park drew big names ranging from John Legend to a pre-presidency Joe Biden. The company attracted a roster of major advertisers, clients and grants, according to testimony. But behind the scenes, prosecutors say, Ozy started bleeding money in 2018 and began trying to save itself with lies. The company told a prospective investor it \u201cfinished 2017 with approximately 12 million in revenue\u201d but gave its accountants a number under $7 million. The gaps widened with the years, yawning to as much as $53 million-vs.-$11 million for 2020, according to testimony and documents shown at trial. Meanwhile, Ozy frequently delayed paying vendors and rent, borrowed against future receipts to get pricey cash advances and struggled to make payroll, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre testified. The defense portrayed the cash scrambles as the growing pains of a successful startup. \u201cOzy Media did not defraud its investors or anyone else,\u201d said the company\u2019s lawyer, Shannon Frison. Watson lawyer and Harvard Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan Jr. said his client \u201cbelieved every number that he gave every investor.\u201d Sullivan suggested revenue figures could vary depending on whether they account for such \u201cin-kind\u201d income as trading ads with another outlet. Poutre testified that auditors rarely agree to count such revenue and she did not feel Watson was always honest. \u201cI don\u2019t know where his numbers came from. I know where my numbers came from,\u201d she said. The alleged schemes went beyond questionable numbers. While trying to get Ozy a bank loan in 2020, Rao faked a contract saying that Winfrey\u2019s OWN network had renewed \u201cBlack Women OWN The Conversation\u201d for a second season. When the bank wanted information directly from the network, Rao set up a phony email account for a real OWN executive and used it to offer the bank \u201cbackground on the transaction.\u201d Rao told jurors that Watson verbally approved the charade. Jurors saw a text message from Watson exhorting Rao to \u201cbe bold, get it done,\u201d but the \u201dit\u201d wasn\u2019t specified. Ultimately, witnesses said, neither the loan nor the show renewal happened. Rao\u2019s infamous phone call came the next year as Ozy sought an investment from Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. He\u2019d falsely claimed YouTube was paying for Watson\u2019s eponymous talk show. When Goldman bankers wanted confirmation, he downloaded a voice-modifying app and pretended to be a YouTube executive on a call with them. But the bankers were wary, the real YouTube exec soon found out and Watson told Goldman Sachs and Ozy\u2019s board that his co-founder had suffered a mental breakdown. The investment didn\u2019t materialize, but Goldman Sachs continued advertising with Ozy after the episode, Rao said. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants but was not having a psychiatric crisis when he made the call. Watson was present and coaching him via text message, Rao said. \u201cI am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,\u201d reads one text, which Rao explained as Watson feeding him a line for his phony persona to say. Then Watson urged, \u201cuse the right pronouns. You are NOT OZY,\u201d among other messages. Watson\u2019s lawyer said the Ozy founder stumbled upon Rao\u2019s deceit midstream, was appalled and signaled him to hang up. The defense has emphasized that Rao drafted a 2021 letter \u2014 ultimately unsent \u2014 saying the phone ruse was his alone. Rao told jurors he wrote it to protect the company. Defense lawyers have cast him as an incompetent executive, confessed fabricator and admitted criminal who\u2019s falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison for his own crimes. \u201cSo, Mr. Rao, you\u2019re a liar, right?\u201d Sullivan asked during cross-examination last Friday. \u201cRegrettably,\u201d Rao replied, \u201cI\u2019ve told many lies in my time at Ozy.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Firms including HSBC Holdings Plc and law firm Clifford Chance have said in recent years they\u2019re leaving Canary Wharf in order to take up new space in the City of London.\u00a0 Revolut\u2019s headquarters are already based in Canary Wharf but its next address will give the upstart a more central spot in the east London financial hub.\u00a0 The neighborhood has been central to Revolut\u2019s development: The fintech started out with just two desks at Level39, a co-working space for tech companies located in the area. It has since grown to become one of Europe\u2019s most valuable startups with more than 40 million customers around the world.\u00a0 The firm plans to display its white and black logo on the side of the new building, a move that\u2019s not typically permitted in the City of London and allows the fintech to follow in the footsteps of banking giants like Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc, whose logos already dot the Canary Wharf skyline. The move comes as Revolut is in the midst of a worldwide hiring spree. Earlier this year, the company said it expects its global workforce to reach 11,500 by the end of 2024, which would be a 40% increase from 2023.\u00a0 While the fintech is based in London, it calls itself a \u201cremote-first\u201d company and more than a third of the firm\u2019s workforce lives outside the city. Still, the new office is important for attracting new talent across engineering and banking, according to Francesca Carlesi, who leads Revolut\u2019s business across the UK. Carlesi has been vocal about her efforts to shore up support for London as the global center for fintechs and has warned that Paris and New York were competing to host promising finance startups.\u00a0 While Storonsky has said he believes that some British regulations are holding back business, Carlesi has\u00a0previously said\u00a0London remains on Revolut\u2019s radar for an eventual initial public offering. Revolut snagged a $33 billion valuation in its last funding round in 2021, though concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on profitability have dragged on many fast-growing finance firms in the years since then.\u00a0 \u201cThis new head office strengthens our commitment to the UK, our home country, whilst also establishing the foundation to support future growth,\u201d Carlesi said. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The more than dozen employees were all in the firm\u2019s wealth- and investment-management team, and were \u201cdischarged after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work.\u201d The issue was raised in a filing with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which was seen by Bloomberg. \u201cWells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior,\u201d\u00a0a company spokeswoman told Fortune. What the filing doesn\u2019t make clear is quite how the employees managed to fake their working day, and for how long they got away with it. Whether or not the employees were in the office or working from home is not stated, though the wider policy for Wells Fargo staffers is to be in-person at least three days a week. \u201cA hybrid schedule is available with many of our corporate positions, giving you the flexibility to work from home on some days and at the office on others,\u201d the company\u2019s website adds\u2014a public position at odds with the widespread push on Wall Street to return to the office. While Wells Fargo\u2014which is the third biggest bank in America\u2014did not expand on how its staffers \u201csimulated\u201d working, there are many techniques and technologies available. During the coronavirus pandemic when staff were sent to their home offices, social media was alight with tips and tricks on how to get away with looking busy while doing the bare minimum.  One of the tools some people reportedly used was a \u201cmouse mover\u201d or \u201cjiggler\u201d so that activity on the device was recorded. As a result, the individual would always seem to be \u201conline\u201d with their screen active. Likewise keyboard \u201cclickers\u201d simulate an individual typing, when actually a machine is pressing random buttons on a device\u2019s keyboard. Such tools are still readily available to purchase online\u2014with some claiming to be \u201cundetectable.\u201d The Wells Fargo incident may have proved a small victory for the Wall Street majority who have been pushing to get staff back to their desks more often\u2014where their bosses can see them.  Despite the upsides experts have flagged with hybrid work\u2014from its being a better solution for women to ensuring the retention of highly talented individuals\u2014many finance titans have pushed hard to get their staff back. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, for example, has pushed employees at America\u2019s biggest bank to return to the office. Last year he said that companies should \u201cmodify\u201d their models to help women who needed an additional layer of flexibility, but more widely believes remote work \u201cdoesn\u2019t work for young kids or spontaneity or management.\u201d As a result senior leaders at the company are required to be at their desks five days a week, with other employees expected in at least three times. The line is the same at Morgan Stanley, with former CEO\u2014now chairman\u2014James Gorman giving staffers a no-nonsense reality check back in January last year. In an\u00a0interview with Bloomberg he said: \u201c[Staff] don\u2019t get to choose their compensation, they don\u2019t get to choose their promotion, they don\u2019t get to choose to stay home five days a week. I want them with other employees at least three or four days.\u201d Goldman Sachs is in the same boat\u2014and has repeatedly reminded employees that they need to be in the office five days a week. Last summer human resources chief Jacqueline Arthur said: \u201cWhile there is flexibility when needed, we are simply reminding our employees of our existing policy. We have continued to encourage employees to work in the office five days a week.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Only yesterday Ellison\u2019s net worth was $138 billion, but overnight that leaped $14 billion, to $152 billion. That\u2019s largely because the 79-year-old entrepreneur owns more than 40% of the cloud applications business, which saw its shares surge 13% on June 11 after the company posted positive year-end financial results.  As a result of his sudden increase in wealth Ellison jumped past two other tech titans on Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index: former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and the founder of Google parent company Alphabet, Sergey Brin. While Ballmer and Brin have both seen boosts to their wealth so far this year ($21.2 billion and $27.2 billion respectively), it hasn\u2019t been enough to stay ahead of Ellison, whose fortune has ballooned by $29.1 billion in 2024 alone, taking it to a record high. The reason for their collective riches growing so exponentially is Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite term: artificial intelligence. Turning first to Oracle, in its bumper outlook released Tuesday, CEO Safra Catz said the organization had signed \u201cthe largest sales contracts in our history\u2014driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models.\u201d Catz, who previously held the role of CFO at Oracle, continued: \u201cThroughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales\u2026even higher. \u201cIn Q4 alone, Oracle signed over 30 AI sales contracts totaling more than $12.5 billion\u2014including one with OpenAI to train ChatGPT in the Oracle Cloud.\u201d As well as the OpenAI contract, Oracle is also working more closely with Microsoft\u2014a backer of the ChatGPT maker\u2014and Google. During the earnings call, Ellison said: \u201cAs customers continue to choose and use multiple clouds, hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google are responding by interconnecting their clouds.\u00a0 \u201cOracle recently signed an agreement with Google to interconnect our clouds\u2026 We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year.\u201d Others with Big Tech ties have also seen their wealth spike this year thanks to\u2014you guessed it\u2014AI. Across the board the super-rich have seen at least $150 billion added to their fortunes courtesy of the tech. Take Brin, who owns 41.8% of Alphabet\u2019s Class B stocks\u2014per the company\u2019s 2023 proxy statement\u2014and CEO Sundar Pichai, who owns 227,560 Class A shares. Both individuals have seen their fortunes grow thanks to the disruptive technology, with Pichai now nearing billionaire status thanks to his salary package and stock awards. Alphabet\u2019s stock has surged this year\u2014up 28% for the year to date at the time of writing\u2014but has bounced particularly when earnings have shared positive AI news. On April 25, in one example, the company announced its Q12024 results and said it was \u201cwell underway with our Gemini era\u201d and was continuing to establish itself as an AI leader. The market liked what it heard, and shares opened 15% higher the day following the announcement compared to the morning prior. The story is the same for Ballmer and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates. In April, Gates\u2019s wealth grew $2 billion off the back of an earnings call which mentioned AI 50 times, as CEO Satya Nadella revealed a raft of new AI deployments. He said: \u201cWe have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it\u2019s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0and leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.\u201d After the call Microsoft shares logged their best single-day percentage hike since November 2022. Analysts also pointed out the shares reached a milestone on an absolute basis\u2014they had previously never risen more than $19.77 in a single session, until they did at the end of April. Elsewhere Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth has grown thanks to a combination of his \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d and his adventures in artificial intelligence. In January, Zuckerberg outlined a raft of measures to streamline the company and in February outlined a wider artificial intelligence strategy\u2014since then his wealth has grown from $63 billion to $181 billion, per Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Shares of the company jumped at the opening bell Thursday after the company\u00a0said in a regulatory filing\u00a0that stockholders are voting to approve Musk\u2019s pay, valued around $44.9 billion, by a wide margin. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Tesla published Musk\u2019s own posts late Wednesday on X, the social media platform he owns, with charts that appeared to show that shareholders were in favor of his compensation package, as was a measure to move Tesla\u2019s legal home from Delaware to Texas. The company sought the votes after a Delaware judge\u00a0threw out the pay package,worth $44.9 billion in January. Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick determined that Tesla deceived shareholders when the pay package was approved in 2018, so Musk is not entitled to the landmark package, which climbed to nearly $56 billion before a stock slide this year. Legal experts say that releasing vote totals while balloting is in progress could present problems for Tesla, and that may be why the company made the filing with the SEC, which is likely to look into the matter. Shareholders can still cast votes online Thursday and in person Thursday afternoon at Tesla\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. They also can change previously cast votes. \u201cAnytime you tell people you\u2019re winning, you\u2019re encouraging others to join you and those who oppose you to pull back,\u201d said Charles Elson, a retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan, said Musk\u2019s posts could draw legal scrutiny. \u201cHis post had better be accurate or else anyone who bought stock relying on it will have a securities law case against him,\u201d Gordon said in an email. The SEC declined comment Thursday, and a message was left seeking comment from Tesla. Elson said posting corporate proxy vote totals before the balloting ends is \u201chighly unusual.\u201d Social media posts by Musk have drawn scrutiny from the SEC before. He and Tesla\u00a0were fined a total of $40 million\u00a0for statements about funding to make Tesla a private company that Musk made on X\u2019s predecessor, Twitter, before he bought the social media platform. Shares of Tesla shot up nearly 5% to $185.77 early Thursday. The stock is down about 25% this year. If the pay package is approved, it would almost guarantee that Musk would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla\u2019s future. But if shareholders were to vote against his pay, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. Or he could even walk away from Tesla. Even with approval, there would be uncertainty. Musk has threatened on X to develop AI elsewhere if he\u00a0doesn\u2019t get a 25% stake\u00a0in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk\u2019s xAI recently received\u00a0$6 billion in funding\u00a0to develop artificial intelligence. According to Musk, early indications suggest that shareholders also back a move to relocate Tesla\u2019s legal home to Texas, and out of Delaware. The move is designed to escape from the Delaware court\u2019s oversight and possibly from McCormick\u2019s ruling. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark pay package. Multiple institutional investors have come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla\u2019s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don\u2019t announce their votes or wouldn\u2019t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. One institutional investor who came out against the package is California\u2019s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk\u2019s pay \u201cbased on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.\u201d In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis,\u00a0recommended voting against the package. But Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. \u201cBecause the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us \u2014 and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard \u2014 as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,\u201d she wrote. Tesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved. If Tesla finalizes the vote on moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas before the vote on Musk\u2019s pay package, and it manages to file the paperwork in Austin and get approval of the move, then the effect of the Delaware court ruling could be in doubt. Reapproval of the pay package would then be done as a Texas corporation and could fall under the purview of Texas courts. Anticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk\u2019s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won\u2019t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week\u2019s shareholder vote, they wrote. In an order denying Tornetta\u2019s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla\u2019s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. \u201cThe defendants\u2019 statements give me great comfort,\u201d she wrote. Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said the lawyers are unlikely to try to move the case because their livelihood is handling business cases in Delaware courts. But it\u2019s also possible that the unpredictable Musk could change lawyers. McCormick, Talley said, is telling the lawyers \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to believe you, but I\u2019m going to be really irritated if this is a big send up for these things that you said you\u2019re not going to do.\u201d Talley, who also is a Tesla shareholder and said at present he plans to vote against Musk\u2019s pay, expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick\u2019s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

If you had asked me to point out Oklahoma, let alone Tulsa, on a map three years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it. Fast forward to today and, while my geography hasn\u2019t much improved, I can not only point out Oklahoma on a map, I live there. I\u2019m a native Californian\u2014born in San Jose, raised in Orland, moved to Los Angeles after college. I never planned to leave the Golden State, but when the pandemic hit in 2020, my priorities quickly shifted.\u00a0 My life has been marked by stories of my being the \u201cfirst\u201d and\/or the \u201conly\u201d in my family, community, or profession to achieve particular goals. I was the first in my family to go to college and the only to hold a graduate degree. I am the first female entrepreneur in my family and the only one to own multiple rental properties. More recently, I became the first Black female certified financial planner in the state of Oklahoma, and I remain the only one. I was also the first in my family to move to Oklahoma\u2014though, thankfully, I\u2019m not the only one here now. In the past three years since moving to Tulsa, I\u2019ve convinced my younger sister, my parents, my niece, and some of my cousins to join me. We now have nine family members here, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll continue to persuade more to move. We all relocated from California and collectively have bought four properties in the Tulsa area\u2014and have volunteered over 2,000 hours of our time to local Tulsa organizations.\u00a0 Moving to Tulsa brought me closer to my family and restored a sustainable balance to my life that was evading me in California. However, ultimately it came down to a calculated financial move. To understand my story, let\u2019s back up a bit. My dad was a self-employed butcher for over 45 years. I grew up watching him build his business with sweat equity while my mom put her personal dreams on hold to stay home and raise me and my three sisters. We were not wealthy, but we never wanted for anything. My parents poured what little expendable income they had into their kids\u2014sending us to a private Christian school, allowing us to play sports, and participating in every school event and fundraiser. They never limited our imaginations nor allowed us to put limitations on ourselves. Growing up in that environment laid the foundation for my personal successes and drives me to give back to them, even though it was never a quid-pro-quo arrangement.\u00a0 Now back to 2020. I was living in Los Angeles during the pandemic, renting an overpriced townhome and making car payments on a vehicle I had nowhere to drive. My family lived seven hours away in Northern California. On a positive professional note, my business effortlessly shifted to a virtual format, allowing me to triple the number of clients I could meet in a week without fighting traffic. Financially, I was saving money because I wasn\u2019t eating out, paying for gas, shopping, or participating in other costly activities. That shift, resulting in finally having expendable income, opened the door for me to explore what to do with it. I looked at buying property in Los Angeles but ran into three major problems. First, I couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of paying so much for so little. Second, eventually my expenses would go up, and I\u2019d likely be \u201chouse poor,\u201d unable to maintain my desired lifestyle. Finally, and most importantly, I missed my family and wanted to live near them, but they couldn\u2019t afford Los Angeles, and I didn\u2019t want to live in a rural Northern California town.\u00a0 I\u2019m not one to compromise, so I found a solution. We needed to move somewhere affordable, with business and entertainment opportunities\u2014a place that wasn\u2019t too rural but also didn\u2019t have the fast-paced life of Los Angeles. So, I began to research, making spreadsheets, pros and cons lists, potential budgets, and creating a targeted list of places to move to. I included quantitative measures on statistics such as average home price, median cost of living, demographics, and airport proximity. And I included qualitative measures such as activities for the family, history of the city, charitable organizations, and more. Imagine my surprise when Tulsa, Oklahoma, checked more boxes than all the other cities. Considered one of the most philanthropic cities in the U.S. per capita, home of Black Wall Street, a lower cost of living, and an organization called \u201cTulsa Remote\u201d that would pay me $10,000 just to move there! It was the easiest decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u00a0 Though there were numerous \u201cemotional\u201d benefits, the financial benefits of the move ultimately sealed the deal for me and my family. I booked my flights for September 2020 and lined up home viewings with a local realtor. My dad, though much more cautious than I about a potential move, joined me and helped me pick out my first home. I closed on that property in November 2020, sold all my belongings in Los Angeles, packed my car, and was in Tulsa by December 7, 2020.\u00a0 Never had I imagined I would be a homeowner at the age of 29\u2014it was financially impossible for me in California. I was able to purchase an entire home for a monthly mortgage equivalent to my portion of renting a room in a North Hollywood townhome with no yard and no ownership. Meanwhile, I informed my parents that they would be moving too, as I picked this city with them in mind, and they needed to start taking steps to prepare. (I didn\u2019t become \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201conly\u201d by being passive, and my parents knew I would wear them down eventually.) I appealed to my mother by convincing her how fun it would be to live near me again\u2014I had left for college at age 17 and hadn\u2019t lived near them since. I convinced my dad by running the numbers with him and showing it would save him money to move. My dad is now retired and on a fixed income, and even with cost-of-living adjustments, their money was not going as far as it used to. I also knew that my parents would eventually need some sort of in-home assistance as they aged, and that was not something I could provide if we were states away.\u00a0 While I will always claim California as my home, Tulsa is now my home. Since moving, I\u2019ve bought two properties, opened up my own financial planning firm (Bamboo Financial Partners), and received two additional professional designations. But those are just numbers. What my financial spreadsheets didn\u2019t foresee was that I would have the free time to play in local volleyball leagues, the ability to take on raising my teenage niece and become her bonus mom, that I could finally have time to adopt a dog (my Smokey Bear), that I could see my little sister finally not have to work three jobs just to make ends meet, and that I could volunteer and be a board member of local organizations (shoutout to Tulsa Boys Home, Leadership Tulsa, and the Tulsa Dream Center). Most importantly, I get to experience life with my family. These are moments, years, and memories I can never get back. While I made my decision with finances in mind, the ultimate benefits of my move cannot be quantified, only felt.\u00a0 The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of\u00a0Fortune. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

(AP) \u2014 As the head of an association of winemakers in southern Ukraine, Georgiy Molchanov knows a lot about how to cultivate grapes; not so much how to grow them amid undetonated mines. But that was the situation he found himself in after a Russian rocket dropped the explosives on his vineyard near the port city of Mykolaiv in August 2022, six months after Russia invaded. The damage \u2014 and danger \u2014 the mines brought to his business marked one of the myriad catastrophic effects the more than 2-year-old war has had on the eastern European country. Now, thanks to the combined efforts of the international nonprofit organization Roots of Peace, Rotary International, and the Grgich Hills Estate winery in Napa Valley, Molchanov is taking the steps he needs to reclaim and heal his wounded land. First, Roots of Peace and Rotary International provided him with the expertise and supplies he needed to safely detonate the mines. Then, the groups teamed up to bring him and five other Ukrainian winemakers to Grgich Hills in Rutherford. During a weeklong stay here, they learned about regenerative organic farming, an agricultural method that prioritizes soil health and ecosystem balance. \u201cWe are discussing how to bring nature, how to bring wines, not harm \u2026 into this land,\u201d said Molchanov, who heads the Association of Craft Winemakers in Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea region. He and his fellow entrepreneurs have another goal as well: to spread the message that, despite the ongoing war, the Ukrainian people remain resilient and look forward to life in peace. \u201cPeople in Ukraine are still alive,\u201d said Svitlana Tsybak, Owner and CEO of Beykush Winery, also located in the Mykolaiv area. \u201cYes, war is in our soul, in our life, but we need \u2026 to live our lives so, of course, we need to work.\u201d Tsybak said Russian troops are staked out about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from her vineyard but the war hasn\u2019t directly affected her operations. Her winery started exporting wine to the United States six months ago. She said she wants to learn how to expand the presence of Ukrainian wine in the U.S. market. Heidi Kuhn, a California peace activist\u00a0who founded Roots of Peace, has worked for decades to remove landmines from war-ravaged land that she later helps to convert into vineyards, orchards and vegetable fields. Rotary International, which has collaborated for years with Roots of Peace, helped plan the program for the Ukrainian winemakers and funded their travel to California. \u201cThere\u2019s an estimated 110 million landmines in 60 countries, and today Ukraine tragically has over 30% of the land riddled with landmines,\u201d said Kuhn, whose program is known as the \u201cmines to vines\u201d initiative. In 2000, Kuhn worked with the founder of Grgich Hills Estate, the late Croatian immigrant Miljenko \u201cMike\u201d Grgich, and other vintners to raise funds to clear landmines in Vukovar in eastern Croatia. The town, located in a winemaking region on the banks of the Danube, was reduced to rubble during the 1991-95 war in the former Yugoslavia. Ivo Jeramaz, Grgich\u2019s nephew, a native Croatian and a winemaker at Grgich Hills Estate, said he feels deeply for Ukrainians because he understands how heart-wrenching it is to live through war. He said the family winery has for decades helped Roots of Peace. \u201cThis is just the beginning of a hopeful relationship to literally restore the health of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that not only they see how farming can be conducted without harmful chemicals, but also that they\u2019re inspired and that their hope is elevated.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

As of last year, Meta employed an army of 300 vice presidents staggered into five levels of seniority that are now the prime targets of Zuck\u2019s efficiency cuts, Business Insider reported, citing three people with knowledge of the company. In previous years, there were half as many VPs at Meta, Business Insider noted, and Zuckerberg reportedly wants to slice the roster down to 250.\u00a0 The VP massacre comes after Zuckerberg first declared 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d last February, which resulted in more than 20,000 layoffs that year, according to BI. Zuckerberg later made the changes permanent after witnessing employees \u201cexecute better and faster,\u201d and promised a \u201cleaner\u201d operating structure that included a flatter hierarchy. To help cull supposedly lagging VPs, Meta is leaning on midyear performance reviews and formal annual performance reviews usually conducted in the first quarter. VPs who don\u2019t measure up to their peers through a process called \u201cstack ranking\u201d are likely to get the ax.\u00a0 The VPs are also under the microscope of their superiors, who under company rules are required to label 10% to 12.5% of their reports as underperforming. The tactic could lead to these employees being put on a performance improvement plan and then being laid off. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment and referred Fortune to a February Facebook post by Zuckerberg where he went into detail on Meta\u2019s earnings and added that his \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d changes would become \u201ca permanent part of how we operate.\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s productivity measures stand in stark contrast with Meta\u2019s growth of between 20% and 30% every year prior. But since Meta started its layoffs last year, it hasn\u2019t stopped, and other big companies including Google, Microsoft, and Tesla also joined in. Overall more than 250,000 tech employees were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi.Zuckerberg\u2019s risk in making the major job cuts has been rewarded by investors over the past year. Some analysts have lauded the CEO\u2019s efforts, including those at MoffettNathanson, who in a research note candidly wrote: \u201cMr. Zuckerberg is a capitalist after all.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

It\u2019s true\u2014there\u2019s nothing better than a below-market rate, especially when there\u2019s such a substantial difference, but it keeps you locked in, too; it\u2019s hard to give up a, let\u2019s say, 3% mortgage rate for a 7% one, unless you have no other choice.\u00a0 It\u2019s a phenomenon called the lock-in effect, and all year it has shown subtle signs of easing. Last year, existing home sales fell to their lowest point in almost three decades because nobody was selling or buying homes. But it seems sellers are finally ready; the only thing is, buyers aren\u2019t matching their energy. \u201cHome sellers are returning to the market but finding buyers hesitating,\u201d Zillow\u2019s chief economist Skylar Olsen wrote in a monthly housing report published yesterday.\u00a0 \u201cBuyers aren\u2019t matching sellers\u2019 uptick in activity,\u201d Olsen reiterated. But how do we know sellers are making a comeback? New listings rose roughly 8% in May and close to 13% from a year earlier. \u201cThe effects of \u2018rate lock,\u2019 owners holding on to their existing homes and low-rate mortgages, appear to be lessening over time, even as most outstanding mortgages have a rate well below what\u2019s currently being quoted on the market,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0 Still, there were fewer sales in May than last year; they were down 6%, according to Zillow. Separately, according to a Redfin analysis published today, pending home sales are down 3.5% from a year earlier, which is the biggest decline in more than three months, and its homebuyer demand index, which considers requests for tours and other services from Redfin agents, is down 18% (the lowest since February).\u00a0 Either way, Olsen said, the drop in sales volume helped with a sort of housing restock: The number of homes for sale rose 22% from a year earlier, when it was near an all-time low, and total inventory is at its smallest deficit in three years\u2014which basically means it\u2019s still a ways away from pre-pandemic levels, about 34% less, per Zillow.\u00a0 Competition wasn\u2019t as intense last month, so home price appreciation cooled. In April, home values rose 4.4% from a year earlier, but in May, they rose 3.9% (the monthly increase was lower, too). Slower home price appreciation is great for anyone who wants to buy a home, but home prices are still 45% higher than they were before the pandemic.\u00a0 \u201cZillow\u2019s Market Heat Index shows the nation is becoming a bit friendlier for buyers and is headed toward \u2018neutral\u2019 territory, but sellers still hold a slight advantage,\u201d Olsen wrote. \u201cBuffalo, Hartford, and San Jose are the top markets for sellers among the 50 largest metro areas. New Orleans, Miami, Jacksonville, and Memphis are all tilted toward buyers, giving those in the market better leverage in negotiations.\u201d And nationally, almost a quarter of homes for sale slashed prices, which is the greatest share in the past six years. All in all, it\u2019s a much different, more costly landscape for people who want to buy homes. On a monthly basis, home prices are up in all 50 major metropolitan areas, and on an annual basis, they\u2019re up in 46 metros, per Zillow. We already know home prices are considerably higher since the start of the pandemic; monthly mortgage payments are, too. The typical monthly mortgage payment is 11.3% higher than last year, and ready for this\u2014115.3% since before the pandemic. So not only is the housing world more costly than last year, it\u2019s a completely different entity from four years ago. It\u2019s not hard to imagine why buyers are backing off. Mortgage rates have come down a bit; daily rates are at 6.97% (their lowest in three months on the back of yesterday\u2019s consumer price index report), and weekly rates are at 6.95%. Home price appreciation has slowed as well, according to Zillow. So maybe things will start to look up for would-be buyers?\u00a0 \u201cThe latest inflation report is good for homebuyers because it has already sent mortgage rates down, though this week\u2019s Fed meeting will temper mortgage-rate declines,\u201d Redfin\u2019s economic research lead Chen Zhao said in the analysis. \u201cBut on the other side of the coin, if lower mortgage rates bring back more demand than supply, that could erase the possibility that home-price growth softens, and push prices up even further. Lower rates and higher prices may ultimately cancel each other out when it comes to homebuyers\u2019 monthly payments.\u201d Still, if anything, the housing world is moving toward a balance of sorts, Zillow\u2019s Olsen wrote. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

According to police records, John R. Tyson was booked around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday. Tyson posted bond, and law enforcement released him nine hours later after charging him with driving while intoxicated, careless driving, and making an improper turn. The charges are the Tyson scion\u2019s second-known scrape with the law. Just months after he was appointed to the CFO role in 2022, Tyson was found asleep in a stranger\u2019s bed in her Fayetteville, Ark., home. Police said the woman resident did not know Tyson. The CFO was arrested for public intoxication and criminal trespass after the incident; he later apologized to employees in an email and said he would get counseling for his drinking. Tyson is the son of board chairman John H. Tyson and the great-grandson of the company\u2019s founder, making him a fourth-generation member of the Tyson family. His aunt, Barbara Tyson, serves as a board member. In a statement on its website on Thursday, the company said it was \u201caware\u201d that Tyson had been arrested for an alleged DWI and that it had suspended him effective immediately. Tyson named Curt Calaway as interim CFO in his stead. Tyson himself called his prior conduct embarrassing and told employees that the mistake was a serious one that prompted him to \u201creflect on the impact my actions can have on others.\u201d \u201cThis may be the end of the line for Mr. Tyson,\u201d warned Georgetown University assistant professor Jason Schloetzer, an expert in corporate governance. It would be reasonable for Tyson\u2019s leave to extend into a longer period of time, and if he returns to the company, it might be in a lower-profile role, Schloetzer told Fortune.\u00a0 \u201cLarge firms tend to seek market-facing executives who bring stability and confidence to the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThis second incident, if true, can significantly harm that confidence.\u201d Tyson Foods, whose brands include Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park, was founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson and has traditionally been shepherded by family leadership; its motto is \u201cWe feed the world like family.\u201d The company is headquartered in Springdale, Ark., with 139,000 employees. John R. Tyson earned compensation valued at $2.9 million in 2023, according to company records. C-suite executives of large publicly traded companies like Tyson are rarely in the news for arrests, to say nothing of incurring two sets of charges in a two-year span. Another Arkansas executive, Douglas Ramsey of vegan giant Beyond Meat, was arrested in 2022 for allegedly biting a man\u2019s nose after a football game in Fayetteville. Ramsey previously spent 30 years at Tyson Foods before leaving for Beyond Meat. He retired in October following his September 2022 arrest.\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Too spicy for Europeans","url":"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2024\/06\/13\/ramen-noodles-recalled-denmark-too-spicy-buldak-hot-chili-south-korea\/","description":"A Danish food regulator pulled three varieties of the Buldak ramen brand because the spice levels posed a threat to \u201cchildren and weak or elderly people.\u201d","date":"2024-06-13T17:47:22Z","content":"A Danish food regulator recalled a brand of instant noodles, declaring the chewy, umami-filled strings posed a health hazard, despite not having quality control issues. They were too spicy.\u00a0\u00a0 The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) made the decision to recall three varieties of the popular Buldak instant noodle brand because they were deemed too heavy on the chili.\u00a0\u00a0 The noodles \u201care being recalled as the levels of total capsaicin in the products pose a risk of acute poisoning,\u201d the Danish agency said in a statement on Tuesday.\u00a0 Capsaicin is the naturally occurring ingredient that makes chili peppers spicy, and the culprit behind the burning sensation diners either love or hate in a meal. Buldak noodles are made by Samyang Foods, a South Korean firm that in 2023 saw $2.3 billion in revenue. The word \u201cbuldak\u201d means \u201cfire chicken\u201d in Korean, an indication of what awaits within the colorful packaging. The three varieties of noodles that were subject to the recall are Samyang Buldak 3x Spicy & Hot Chicken, Samyang Buldak 2x Spicy & Hot Chicken, and Samyang Buldak Hot Chicken Stew.\u00a0 The noodle recall was unprecedented for Samyang, according to the company. \u201cThis is the first time they\u2019ve been subject to a recall for this reason,\u201d a Samyang spokesperson told CNN. It\u2019s \u201cbecause it is so spicy that it could cause problems.\u201d The high levels of spice in Buldak noodles were a risk especially for \u201cchildren and weak or elderly people if they consume the total capsaicin content in the packages,\u201d a DVFA spokesperson told Fortune.\u00a0 For the most part spicy foods containing capsaicin are not dangerous.\u00a0 However, extremely high levels of capsaicin can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a burning sensation when ingested, according to the National Capital Poison Center, a nonprofit hotline for poison control guidance.\u00a0 Some studies have found that regular consumption of spicy foods has health benefits. A 2015 study from China found that people who ate spicy food six to seven times a week showed a \u200b\u200b14% \u201crelative risk reduction in total mortality\u201d compared with people who ate spicy food just once a week. There is also some research suggesting spicy foods can help with weight loss because they reduce appetite and cause the body to expend more energy, thus burning calories. A meta-study analyzing some 90 clinical trials found that eating spicy foods often \u201cwould produce clinically significant levels of weight loss in one to two years,\u201d according to a 2012 academic paper.\u00a0 Buldak noodles were the brainchild of Kim Jung-soo, now Samyang Foods\u2019 CEO. Kim had an unlikely rise to the corner office, marrying into the family that owned Samyang Foods, according to an interview in the Wall Street Journal. She was a housewife until the company hit hard times and her father-in-law, Samyang\u2019s then-chairman, urged her to join the business, which she eventually did as head of sales despite having no corporate experience.\u00a0 \u201cThere was only desperation,\u201d Kim said of her early days at Samyang.\u00a0 Eventually she would help turn around the company\u2019s fate when a lunch with her daughter at a rice shop that served extra-spicy stir-fry sparked the idea for Buldak. Immediately following the lunch Kim went to a grocery store and bought three of every hot sauce and chili powder. Two sets went to Samyang\u2019s product development and marketing teams respectively. And the last one she took home for her own hands-on testing, according to the Journal. After months of research that required 1,200 chickens, two tons of hot sauce, and chili peppers from around the world, the Buldak recipe was perfected.\u00a0\u00a0 In the U.S., Buldak\u2019s spiciest noodles gained popularity in recent years after they sparked a social media trend. Buldak\u2019s hot ramen spawned YouTube videos with hyperbolic titles like \u201cSpicy Nuclear Fire Noodle Challenge\u201d and \u201cEXTREME SPICY RAMEN CHALLENGE!!! (DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME).\u201d\u00a0 Buldak hadn\u2019t paid influencers to try the product but still welcomed the attention. \u201cCreators expressed themselves in an organic and truthful way,\u201d Kim told the Journal. The brand then gained even more popularity when it released a carbonara flavor\u2014a reference to the popular Roman pasta dish that features egg, pork cheek, pecorino, and Parmesan. That Italian-inspired variety launched its own wave of social media reaction videos\u2014including from A-listers like Cardi B\u2014and sold out across the country. (Cardi B\u2019s social media video caused Samyang\u2019s stock to shoot up more than 30%.)\u00a0 The DVFA cited the rise of social media challenges in the country as one of the reasons for its own decision to ban Buldak\u2019s spiciest products. This isn\u2019t the first time this year a spicy food was subject to a recall because of a social media challenge. In the U.S. a teen died from participation in a challenge encouraging people to eat a single, extra spicy tortilla chip. The manufacturer Paqui, then asked retailers to stop selling the product.\u00a0 Spice-averse Danes who still want to try the product might take a page from Kim who herself found Buldak noodles too hot. \u201cBut after eating them for a long time, it\u2019s become more and more delicious and familiar,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Eligible U.S. travelers can once again renew their passports online. The State Department on Wednesday began allowing a limited number of people to renew their passports online each day. Under the program, which is currently in beta testing, the department will issue a currently undisclosed number of spots at around 1 p.m. Eastern Time, seven days a week. The application site will be open until each day\u2019s spots have been filled, and the State Department will gradually increase the number it accepts each day. The government previously tested online passport renewals in 2022 before pausing it in March of last year. Since the pandemic, travelers have faced extensive delays in receiving their renewals; the new system is meant to assuage some of that. Here\u2019s what to know about the new online process. Not everyone can renew their passports online. Applicants must be 25 years or older, and the passport they are renewing must have been valid for 10 years and issued between 2009 and 2015. They also cannot be changing their name, gender, date of birth, or place of birth, according to the State Department\u2019s website. Additionally, applicants must be at least eight weeks away from the time of their next international trip, and must live in the U.S. They must also be able to upload a digital passport photo and pay for the renewal with a credit or debit card, among other restrictions. Those applying for a passport for the first time must still do so in person. Standard application fees apply to the online process. More information can be found on the State Department\u2019s website. The State Department says processing should take around six to eight weeks\u2014assuming applicants are eligible and fill out everything correctly. The online process is not currently available for expedited renewals. Travelers who don\u2019t qualify for the online application can still send in their renewals by mail, or by visiting a post office. The State Department estimates wait times will be about the same for online and mail-in applications. Just because an applicant isn\u2019t able to submit their renewal on a certain date does not mean they are not eligible\u2014they just might have missed that day\u2019s window, and can try again the next. After receiving a traveler\u2019s renewal application and payment, the State Department will send an email that confirms payment is pending, and another when it has received the money. After that, travelers can track the application\u2019s progress via the State Department\u2019s online passport status system, which will indicate when it has been processed, approved, and mailed. All the State Department has said so far is that the beta program will last \u201cseveral months\u201d to help it work out kinks and issues in the system. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

By the time they turn 60, Gen Xers (born between 1965 and 1980) are projected to see a cancer rate higher than that of baby boomers\u2014and any prior generation born between 1964 and 1908, for that matter.\u00a0 The only exception was with Gen X Asian or Pacific Islander males, whose rates of cancer are projected to go down, per the report.\u00a0 The findings were published this week in the JAMA Network Open and come out of the National Cancer Institute. The cohort study was led by senior investigator Philip Rosenberg, PhD, who used what\u2019s called an age period cohort model to make the predictions, analyzing data of 3.8 million people (Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic white) with cancer through the institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.\u00a0 Rosenberg tells Fortune that for him, understanding how cancer rates vary from one generation to the next is a research passion. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of understanding history in a way,\u201d he says.\u00a0 And these results, he admits, took him by surprise.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGoing in, I was anticipating that I may see colon or rectal cancer rates in particular to be as high or higher than the boomers, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s just so much of these studies coming out about early onset colorectal cancer cases,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what kind of took me more by surprise was the number of different cancer types that our models project will occur in Generation X compared to baby boomers.\u201d Gen X women, the research found, will see significant increases over baby boomer women of the following cancers: thyroid, kidney, rectal, corpus uterine, colon, and pancreatic, plus non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and leukemia. Gen X men, meanwhile, will see increases in thyroid, kidney, rectal, colon, and prostate cancers and leukemia.\u00a0 Lung and cervical cancer incidence is on track to decrease among Gen X women, while lung, liver, and gall bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma incidence will decrease among Gen X men. Breast cancer rates will stay about the same, although Rosenberg and his team are currently looking into breast cancer rates in greater detail.\u00a0 The study noted: \u201cNumerous preventable causes of cancer have been identified. Cancer control initiatives have led to substantial declines in tobacco consumption. Screening is well accepted for precancerous lesions of the colon, rectum, cervix, uterus, and breast.\u201d But despite all of that, \u201cother suspected carcinogenic exposures are increasing.\u201d Among those, the study points out, are PFAs (\u201cforever chemicals\u201d), processed food, and \u201crising obesity rates and increasingly sedentary lifestyles.\u201d\u00a0 Another possibility for the rise in cancer rates, the study posits, is that changes in cancer registry policies as well as the rise of medical imaging technology in making diagnoses have led to more cancer cases being counted.\u00a0 Rosenberg explains that the primary purpose of a study like this is to \u201cprovide clues for other researchers to follow, so when you see the unexpected, that\u2019s where to look to see cancer causes and novel means of prevention.\u201d But a useful takeaway for the public, he says, is to focus on the many recommendations that are out there when it comes to reducing the risk of cancer.\u00a0 \u201cSpending some time thinking about those recommendations would be a great exercise for all of us\u2014really saying, \u2018Am I doing everything I can?\u2019\u201d That would include eating healthy and staying active, following evidence based advice for specific screenings, \u201cobviously not smoking,\u201d and drinking in moderation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of advice that people can take to heart,\u201d he says. The disparity in health care, though, is having a worrisome impact on certain groups. As the study pointed out: \u201cThe Black-to-white cancer mortality gap narrowed following passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. However, income inequality, underinsurance, food swamps and deserts, deficits in the built environment, and other factors make it difficult for everyone to eat healthy and stay active. Taken together, these findings indicate that for many people in the U.S., a healthy lifestyle remains, to various degrees, an unattainable privilege rather than a fundamental right.\u201d The researchers had too few data points to produce estimates for millennials (born between 1981 and 1996). \u201cOur results beg the question of what the cancer experience may be like among the 72 million millennials\u2026when they enter their 40s, 50s, and 60s,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cOn current trajectories, cancer incidence could remain high for decades.\u201d It\u2019s why Rosenberg tells Fortune, \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a Gen Xer to be concerned\u201d about what\u2019s going on in the world today with all of these issues that may be impacting not only our health, but the future of our children.\u201d More on cancer: \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Boomers are retiring, and nearly all workers in their twenties are now Gen Z (born 1995-2012). According to Glassdoor, there are now more Gen Zers in the U.S. workforce than boomers. That\u2019s a problem, because many companies don\u2019t understand Gen Z. It\u2019s often difficult to separate myth from reality with the generations turning over so quickly. That\u2019s one reason I wrote my book Generations, which takes a deep dive into more than a dozen large surveys conducted over several decades. That means we can see what teens and young adults say about themselves, compared to previous generations at the same age. In other words, these data can tell us what is actually different about young people now as opposed to their just being young.

The debate over remote and hybrid work continues as companies like Nike blame a lack of in-person collaboration for lackluster business performance. Proponents of remote work argue more flexible options results in more well-being for employees, which in turn drives productivity. When you look at the Fortune Best Workplaces\u2122 in New York, Chicago, Texas, and the Bay Area, these companies dramatically outperform the typical U.S. workplace, regardless of their remote work policies. \u00a0 Research shows that although employees at a typical U.S. workplace benefit from remote work, that doesn\u2019t make those companies great workplaces. What does? The level of trust employees have in their leaders and colleagues. At companies on this year\u2019s lists, employees report better relationships with their managers, a more psychologically and emotionally healthy work environment, and more work-life balance than at typical U.S. workplaces. As a result, these employees are more likely to stay at their company and adapt quickly to change\u2014key outcomes for every business facing an artificial intelligence revolution. \u201cWhen we debate remote and hybrid work and its impact on workplace culture, we often ask the wrong questions,\u201d says Michael C. Bush, CEO of Great Place To Work\u00ae. \u201cThe Best Workplaces are constantly reevaluating efforts to meet the specific needs of their people. That\u2019s what builds the trust that drives business performance.\u201d The Best Workplaces ensure employees feel included in decision making. Eight in 10 employees (81%) at companies on this year\u2019s lists agreed that management involved people in decisions that affect them. At the typical U.S. workplace, only half of employees (51%) say the same, a difference of 59%. \u00a0 Employees at winning companies are also more likely to say their manager shows a sincere interest in them as a person, not just a worker on the team. Great Place To Work research shows that companies benefit when they allow employees to have a voice in where they work, with typical U.S. employees being three times more likely to stay and 14 times less likely to \u201cquit and stay\u201d when they can choose where they work. That doesn\u2019t mean that remote work is a requirement for creating a great workplace culture. Regardless of whether remote work is a natural fit for your industry, employers build trust by solving for the specific needs of their people, and companies in every industry can and do create winning workplaces. In practice, co-creating culture starts with listening. At Wegmans Food Markets, the No. 3 large company on the Fortune Best Workplaces in New York\u2122 List, work life flexibility has always been part of the equation and a key reason the retailer says candidates choose Wegmans. For part-time employees, representing about 65% of Wegmans\u2019 workforce, the company offers a variety of positions and shifts, where part-time employees can essentially define their availability to determine when and how often they would like to work. For full-time employees, various surveys and employee listening channels revealed that a predictable, consistent day off each week would be helpful. While Wegmans retail employees still must work onsite at a Wegmans store, this scheduling policy allows them even more flexibility to plan for their personal needs, arrange childcare and schedule appointments. Trust is more important for creating a healthy work environment than a remote work policy.\u00a0 Great Place To Work found that remote employees at typical U.S. companies were 19% more likely to report a psychologically and emotionally healthy workplace than onsite or hybrid workers. But this year\u2019s winning companies dramatically overperformed the typical U.S. employee experience, no matter where their employees work. At Best Workplaces, 88% of employees said they had a psychologically and emotionally healthy work environment, a 59% increase over employees who said the same at typical U.S. companies. The result? Employees with these experiences are more likely to want to stay with their company long term. Best Workplaces excel at ensuring that every employee can maintain a healthy work-life balance, regardless of remote policies. At companies on the list, 94% of employees say they can take time off when needed and 88% say managers promote a healthy work-life balance. At typical U.S. companies, only 75% said they could take needed time off, and 63% reported a healthy work-life balance. Best Workplaces are differentiated by their determination to create a great experience for every employee, regardless of role or tenure.  \u201cBeing a For All Leader means being curious about how different groups of employees are experiencing your workplace,\u201d says Bush. \u201cWhether an employee is new to the company, part-time, or working the night shift, they all have human needs that employers can\u2019t ignore.\u201d At Crowe, the No. 1 large company on the Fortune Best Workplaces in Chicago\u2122 List, employees can access time off from the moment they are hired, which can be used for a variety of reasons from doctor\u2019s appointments and vacations to mental health days and volunteering. At Texas Health Resources, the No. 3 large company on the Fortune Best Workplaces in Texas\u2122 List, non-exempt employees are given an extra day of paid time off each calendar year, called a \u201cMy Flex Day,\u201d which can be used for any reason in addition to the traditional allotment of PTO days. When you ask your employees about the specific challenges of their work, you can find many creative solutions to improve well-being. At Camden Property Trust, the No. 1 large company on the Texas list, members of the maintenance team, which services properties for repairs, struggled to maintain a healthy work-life balance because their job involves responding to after-hours calls for emergency maintenance. To meet the team\u2019s needs, Camden implemented quiet hours for onsite maintenance teams, greatly reducing after hours calls, ensuring these workers could set aside time to rest and enjoy time with their families.

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\u201d Rico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency. \u201cYou know when its coming,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s just getting worse, and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\u201d Travelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning.\u00a0More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida\u00a0since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days. Ticket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal\u2019s flights had been canceled or postponed. Bill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn\u2019t get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight. \u201cIt was a zoo,\u201d said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \u201cNothing against the (airport) employees \u2014 there is only so much they can do.\u201d So he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn\u2019t get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry. \u201cJust a long day sitting in airports,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThis is kind of par for the course for government travel.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0downpours and subsequent flooding\u00a0blocked roads, floated vehicles and even\u00a0delayed the Florida Panthers\u00a0on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers. The disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is\u00a0forecast to be among the most active\u00a0in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity. The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. In Hallandale Beach, Alex Demchemko, was walking his Russian spaniel Lex along the still-flooded sidewalks near the Airbnb where he\u2019s lived after arriving from Russia last month to seek asylum in the U.S. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out from our apartment, but we had to walk with our dog,\u201d Demchemko said. \u201cA lot of flashes, raining, a lot of floating cars and a lot of left cars without drivers, and there was a lot of water on the streets. It was kind of catastrophic.\u201d On Thursday morning, Daniela Urrieche, 26, was bailing water out of her SUV, which got stuck on a flooded street as she drove home from work on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIn the nine years that I\u2019ve lived here, this has been the worst,\u201d she said. \u201cEven in a hurricane, streets were not as bad as it was in the past 24 hours.\u201d The flooding wasn\u2019t limited to the streets. Charlea Johnson spent Wednesday night at her Hallendale Beach home barreling water into the sink and toilet. \u201cThe water just started flooding in the back and flooding in the front,\u201d Johnson said. By Wednesday evening, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and mayors in Fort Lauderdale , Hollywood and Miami-Dade County each declared a state of emergency. It\u2019s already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters). More rain was forecast for the rest of the week, with some areas getting another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain. The western side of the state, much of which has been in\u00a0a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well. Forecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The gated micro community known as \u201cThe Melody\u201d doesn\u2019t look like a parking lot anymore. Artificial turf is spread across the asphalt. Potted plants and red Adirondack chairs abound. There\u2019s even a dog park. The shipping containers have been divided into 40 insulated studio apartments that include a single bed, HVAC unit, desk, microwave, small refrigerator, TV, sink and bathroom. On a recent afternoon, a half-dozen residents were chatting around a table in The Melody\u2019s smoking area. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful,\u201d said Cynthia Diamond, a 61-year-old former line cook who uses a wheelchair and used to be chronically homeless. \u201cI have my own door key. I ain\u2019t got to worry about nobody knocking on my door, telling me when to eat, sleep or do anything. I\u2019m going to stay here as long as the Lord allows me to stay here.\u201d Faced with years of\u00a0rising homelessness rates\u00a0and failed solutions, city officials across the U.S. have been embracing rapid housing options emphasizing three factors: small, quick and cheap. Officials believe micro communities, unlike shelters, offer stability that, when combined with wraparound services, can more effectively put residents on the path to secure housing. Denver has opened three\u00a0micro communities and converted another five hotels\u00a0for people who used to be homeless. In Austin, Texas, there are three villages of \u201ctiny homes.\u201d In Los Angeles, a 232-unit complex features two three-floor buildings of stacked shipping containers. \u201cHousing is a ladder. You start with the very first rung. Folks that are literally sleeping on the ground aren\u2019t even on the first rung,\u201d said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, sitting in one of the city\u2019s new micro communities that offer tiny, transitional homes for that first rung. More than 1,500 people have been moved indoors through the program, with over 80% still in the housing as of last month, according to\u00a0city data. The inexpensive units are particularly a boon for cities with high housing costs, where moving that many people directly into apartments wouldn\u2019t be financially feasible. Both Atlanta\u2019s and Denver\u2019s program act as a stepping stone as they work to get people jobs and more permanent housing, with Denver aiming to move people out within six months. That includes Eric Martinez, 28, who has been in limbo between the street and the bottom rung for most of his life. At birth Martinez was flung into the revolving door of foster care, and he\u2019s wrestled with substance use while surfing couches and pitching tents. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of demeaning, it makes me feel less of a person,\u201d said Martinez, his eyes downcast. \u201cI had to get out of it and look out for myself at that point: It\u2019s fight or flight, and I flew.\u201d Martinez\u2019s Denver tent encampment was swept and he along with the others were directed into the micro communities of small cabin-like structures with a twin bed, desk and closet. The city built three such communities with nearly 160 units total in about six months, at roughly $25,000 per unit, said Johnston. The 1,000 converted hotel units cost about $100,000 each. On site at the micro community are bathrooms, showers, washing machines, small dog parks and kitchens, though the Salvation Army delivers meals. The program represents an about-face from policies that for years focused on short-term group shelters and the ceaseless shuffle of encampments from one city block to the next. That system made it difficult to keep people who were scattered through the city connected to services and on the path to permanent housing. Those services in Denver\u2019s and Atlanta\u2019s micro communities are largely centralized. They offer residents case management, counseling, mental health and substance abuse therapy, housing guidance and assistance obtaining anything from vocational skills training to a new pair of dentures. \u201cWe\u2019re able to meet every level of the hierarchy of needs \u2014 from security and shelter, all the way up to self-actualization and the sense of community,\u201d said Peter Cumiskey, the Atlanta site clinician. The Melody, and projects like it, are a \u201cvery promising, feasible and cost-effective way\u201d to tackle homelessness, said Michael Rich, an Emory University political science professor who studies housing policy. Rich noted that transitional housing is still just the first step toward permanent housing. The programs in Denver and Atlanta, taking inspiration from similar ones in cities like Columbia, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, offer a degree of privacy and security not found in congregate shelters or encampments. Giving each resident their own bathroom and kitchen is a crucial feature that helps set The Melody apart, said Cathryn Vassell, whose nonprofit, Partners For Home, oversees the micro community. Aside from a prohibition on overnight guests, staff emphasize the tenants are treated as independent residents. Vassell acknowledged it\u2019s unclear how long the containers will last \u2014 she\u2019s hoping 20 years. But, she said, they were the right choice for The Melody because they were relatively inexpensive and already had handicap-accessible bathrooms since many were used by Georgia hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project, which took only about four months to complete, cost about $125,000 per unit \u2014 not \u201ctremendously inexpensive,\u201d Vassell said, but less than traditional construction, and much quicker. Staffing and security operations cost about $900,000 a year. The Melody is the first part of Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens\u2019 target of supplying 500 units of rapid housing on city-owned land by December 2025. A 2023 \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d count found there were 738 unsheltered people in Atlanta, far fewer than many cities, but still an increase over the previous year. \u201cWe need more Melodies as fast as possible,\u201d said Courtney English, the mayor\u2019s chief policy officer. Few objected when The Melody was announced last year, but as city officials seek to expand the rapid-housing footprint, they know local pushback is likely. That\u2019s what Denver faced. Mayor Johnston said he attended at least 60 town halls in six months as Denver tried to identify locations for the new communities and faced pushback from local residents worried about trash and safety. \u201cWhat they are worried about is their current experience of unsheltered homelessness,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cWe had to get them to see not the world as it used to exist, but the world as it could exist, and now we have the proof points of what that could be.\u201d The scars of life on the street still stick with Martinez. All his belongings are prepped for a move at a moment\u2019s notice, even though he feels secure in his tiny home alongside his cat, Appa. The community has been \u201cvery uplifting and supporting,\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that a lot.\u201d On his wall is a calendar with a job orientation penciled in. The next step is working with staff to get a housing voucher for an apartment. \u201cI\u2019m always looking down on myself for some reason,\u201d he said. But \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job. Everyone is pretty proud of me.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Tom Brady may have just delivered the greatest quote I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cTo be successful at anything, the truth is you don\u2019t have to be special. You just have to be what most people aren\u2019t: consistent, determined and willing to work for it.\u201d pic.twitter.com\/VTIUA9rFHf Brady, who retired from the NFL last year, is widely regarded as the most decorated player in league history. The former quarterback of the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers finished his career as the all-time leader in passing yards and passing touchdowns, and more wins and Super Bowl championships than any other player in the history of the NFL. He\u2019ll be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2028.\u00a0 But the narrative of Brady\u2019s career isn\u2019t just one of unparalleled success: it\u2019s also the classic story of an underdog who overcame one of the worst workouts in NFL combine history, was picked 199th in the 2000 draft, and sat on the bench as a backup for more than a year before developing\u00a0 into one the greatest players of all time.\u00a0 Sub 5.00 next year. Level up. @nobull https:\/\/t.co\/2C6f4WVbxP \u201cNo matter who you are, there are bumps and hits and bruises along the way, and my advice is to prepare yourself,\u201d Brady told the crowd. \u201cFootball teaches us that success and achievement come from overcoming adversity, and that team accomplishment far exceeds any one individual\u2019s goals.\u201d Brady has generated a whirlwind of headlines over the past few years, not all of which were related to his performance on the field. In 2022, during the tail end of his final season with the Buccaneers, the quarterback finalized his divorce with supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen. At the time, rumors were circulating that the split was caused by Bady\u2019s refusal to retire from the NFL\u2014he had retired from the league once before, in February of 2022, but changed his mind six weeks later. B\u00fcndchen has since denied the claim. Both before and since retirement, the future hall of famer has launched a number of business ventures outside of football. In 2024, he merged his wellness company, TB12, and his Brady Brand clothing line with the Boston-based sportswear company NoBull, becoming its second-biggest shareholder.\u00a0 Not every enterprise has been successful. At one point, he owned more than a million shares of the crypto exchange FTX prior to its collapse. He is also a minority owner in the UK soccer club Birmingham City, but the team struggled last year, falling from the second tier of English soccer to the third\u2014unlike Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s Wrexham AFC. In 2022, Brady also signed a massive $375 million, 10-year contract with Fox.

Kickstarter\u2019s chief legal officer, chief strategy officer, vice president of product, and vice president of creator and backer success are among the people leaving, Fortune has learned. As part of the changes, Kickstarter\u2019s vice president of brand marketing, Courtney Brown Warren, was promoted to chief marketing officer, and Mahesh Guruswamy, Kickstarter\u2019s chief technology officer, was promoted to chief product and technology officer. Once a buzzy startup in New York\u2019s burgeoning tech scene, 15-year-old Kickstarter has been trying to reinvent itself after years of flatlined growth, CEO turnover, and contentious union push by rank-and-file employees. This week\u2019s shakeup is the latest attempt by the company to restore its relevance, now under CEO Everette Taylor, who took over the position in 2022.\u00a0 \u201cKickstarter is undergoing a strategic restructuring to become a more agile and collaborative organization. This means a flatter management structure, streamlined workflows, and teams aligned for better synergy,\u201d a Kickstarter spokeswoman said in a statement. She added, \u201cThis change will ultimately allow us to better serve the creative projects and communities that are at the heart of Kickstarter.\u201d  When reached via phone, email, or LinkedIn, impacted employees either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond.\u00a0 Taylor, who was hired as CEO shortly after Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm secretly led a $100 million tender offer three years ago, announced the changes on Thursday during the company\u2019s all-hands meeting. Taylor informed employees that the restructuring was the result of employee surveys and the board wanting to reduce the size of the executive team, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.\u00a0 But rumors of the changes had already been circulating around the company after a Slack automated bot notified staffers that people\u2019s accounts had been deactivated. The news even reached some ex-staffers before the time of the all-hands conference call, according to a person familiar with the messages.\u00a0 Taylor took over the company during a turbulent time in Kickstarter\u2019s history. After generating considerable buzz early on, Kickstarter\u2019s growth stagnated as the company tried to expand its crowdfunding business. A divisive union push exacerbated tensions between leadership and rank-and-file employees, and the company fired two of the union organizers in 2019.\u00a0 In early December 2021, Kickstarter had a funding round led by a16z crypto, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm, in the form of a tender offer, meaning employees could sell their equity to the new investors. As part of the deal, Kickstarter explored relaunching its platform on a little-known blockchain called Celo\u2014an initiative that has yet to pan out. During Taylor\u2019s tenure as CEO, Kickstarter has emphasized increasing its sources of revenue and has hired a new CFO.\u00a0 \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Google did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pichai told jurors. \u201cMr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,\u201d he explained. But \u201cdid you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?\u201d prosecutor Dylan Stern asked. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Pichai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc. He said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened. According to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pichai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before\u00a0falling apart in fall 2021\u00a0amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals, and finances. Ozy Media lawyer Shannon Frison said in an emailed statement Friday that it\u2019s \u201cunequivocally untrue\u201d that Watson told anyone that Google had made a $600 million offer. \u201cHe never had such a conversation with Google and never told any person that he did,\u201d Frison said. Watson and Ozy Media have\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn\u2019t con anyone, and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial \u201cmistakes.\u201d Defense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing. He testified earlier in the trial that his \u201cmoral compass\u201d got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and \u201cCarlos\u2019 deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.\u201d Among other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive \u2014 even using a phone app to disguise his voice \u2014 in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call. \u201cIt was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,\u201d Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode \u201ca surreal experience.\u201d Rao testified that he did the phone trick to back up a false claim that YouTube was paying for Watson\u2019s eponymous talk show. Rao said Watson was with him during the call, texting him about what to say: \u201cI am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,\u201d read one text that was shown to jurors. Defense lawyer Ronald Sullivan Jr. has said Watson came into the room during the call, realized \u201ca live train wreck\u201d was unfolding and tried to get Rao to end the conversation. On the other end, Moerman thought the putative YouTube exec\u2019s voice seemed obviously \u201coff,\u201d among other clues that made the Goldman bankers suspicious, he recalled Friday. One of his colleagues soon called the actual executive at YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet. The ruse unraveled. So did the potential for a Goldman investment. \u201cWe had been lied to,\u201d Moerman explained to the Brooklyn federal court jury. Goldman Sachs did keep advertising with Ozy after the episode, according to Rao\u2019s testimony. Watson told Goldman and Ozy\u2019s board that Rao had suffered a mental health crisis. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants at the time but wasn\u2019t having a psychiatric break. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Judge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones\u2019 proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation, but threw out the attempted reorganization of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems. Many of the Sandy Hook families had asked that the company also be liquidated. If Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy reorganization had been converted to a liquidation, Jones could have lost ownership of the company, its social media accounts, the Infowars studio in Austin and all copyrights as the company\u2019s possessions were sold. Jones smiled as the judge dismissed the company\u2019s case. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what will happen to Free Speech Systems, Infowars\u2019 parent company that Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years. One scenario could be that the company and Infowars are allowed to keep operating while efforts to collect on the $1.5 billion debt are made in state courts in Texas and Connecticut, where the families won lawsuits against Jones, according to lawyers involved with the case. Another scenario is that lawyers for the Sandy Hook families go back to the bankruptcy court and ask Lopez to liquidate the company as part of Jones\u2019 personal case, because Jones owns the business, lawyers said. Lopez said his sole focus in determining whether to dismiss Free Speech Systems\u2019 case or order a liquidation was what would be best for the company and its creditors, including the Sandy Hook families. Lopez also said Free Speech Systems\u2019 case appeared to be one of the longest running of its kind in the country, and it was approaching a deadline to resolve it. \u201cI was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThis case is one of the more difficult cases I\u2019ve had. When you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\u201d Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets will be sold off, but his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. He already has moved to sell his Texas ranch worth about $2.8 million, a gun collection and other assets to pay debts. In the lead-up to Friday\u2019s hearing, Jones had been telling his web viewers and radio listeners that Free Speech Systems was on the verge of being shut down because of the bankruptcy. He urged them to download videos from his online archive to preserve them and pointed them to a new website of his father\u2019s company if they want to continue buying the dietary supplements he sells on his show. \u201cThis is probably the end of Infowars here very, very soon. If not today, in the next few weeks or months,\u201d Jones told reporters before Friday\u2019s hearing. \u201cBut it\u2019s just the beginning of my fight against tyranny.\u201d Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, according to the most recent financial filings in court. Free Speech Systems, which employs 44 people, has about $6 million in cash on hand and about $1.2 million worth of inventory, according to J. Patrick Magill, the chief restructuring officer appointed by the court to run the company during the bankruptcy. Jones and Free Speech Systems\u00a0filed for bankruptcy protection\u00a0in 2022, when relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of\u00a0more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut\u00a0and\u00a0$49 million in Texas. Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the families in the Connecticut case, said liquidating Free Speech Systems would \u201cenable the Connecticut families to enforce their $1.4 billion in judgments now and into the future while also depriving Jones of the ability to inflict mass harm as he has done for some 25 years.\u201d The relatives said they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 comments and his followers\u2019 actions. They have testified about being\u00a0harassed and threatened\u00a0by Jones\u2019 believers, some of whom confronted the grieving families in person saying the shooting never happened and their children never existed. One parent said someone threatened to dig up his dead son\u2019s grave. Jones and Free Speech Systems initially filed for bankruptcy reorganization protection that would have allowed him to run Infowars while paying the families with revenues from his show. But the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a final plan, and Jones\u00a0recently filed for permission\u00a0to switch his personal bankruptcy from a reorganization to a liquidation. The families in the Connecticut lawsuit, including relatives of eight dead children and adults, asked that Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy case also be converted to a liquidation. But the parents in the Texas suit \u2014 whose child, 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, died \u2014 want the company\u2019s case dismissed. Lawyers for the company filed documents indicating it supported liquidation, but attorneys for Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case wanted the judge to dismiss the company\u2019s case. Kyle Kimpler, an attorney for the families seeking liquidation, had told the judge that dismissing the case could lead to a \u201crace to the courthouse.\u201d It\u2019s possible one family could get everything while another gets nothing, he added. Although Jones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook shooting happened, he has been saying on his recent shows that Democrats and the \u201cdeep state\u201d are conspiring to shut down his companies and take away his free speech rights. He also has said the Sandy Hook families are being used as pawns in the conspiracy. The families\u2019 lawyers say that is nonsense. The families have a pending lawsuit in Texas\u00a0accusing Jones of illegally diverting and hiding millions of dollars. Jones has denied the allegations. \u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

That mission, in partnership with SpaceX, launched on September 15, 2021 and returned to Earth three days later.\u00a0 During the mission, the crew experienced a broad set of modest molecular changes, dysregulated immune systems and slight decreases in cognitive performance. But researchers are only able to analyze the data \u2014 more than 100,000 health-related data points \u2014 because the four-person crew was able to reliably collect it in the first place.\u00a0 This is a bigger accomplishment than one might realize. The Inspiration4 crew received plenty of training, in large part with SpaceX, which provided the Dragon capsule for their ride through orbit. But their preparation is still a far cry from that of NASA astronauts aboard the ISS, and who also regularly perform a battery of health tests on themselves. That includes ultrasounds, cognitive tests, biopsies, blood and saliva testing, skin swabs and sensorimotor tests.\u00a0 \u201cYou can do research with private individuals in space, that is the number one result [of the research],\u201d said Dr. Dorit Donoviel in a recent interview. Dr. Donoviel is co-author of one of the papers published in Nature and associate professor in the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. She\u2019s also the executive director of NASA-funded research consortium Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), which conducts and funds cutting-edge research to improve human safety in space.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, nobody was sure that we were going to be able to gather a reasonable amount of data, that we were going to be able to implement it, that regular people who have never had exposure to scientific research could do something that we would actually be able to analyze,\u201d she continued, referring to the Inspiration4 mission.\u00a0 In some obvious ways, the Inspiration4 crew are far from ordinary: The mission\u2019s leader, Jared Isaacman, is a billionaire that founded a payment processing company when he was 16; Hayley Arcenaux is a physician\u2019s assistant at the world-renowned St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital; Sian Proctor is a pilot with a PhD who teaches geology at the college level; and Christopher Sembroski is a former U.S. Air Force journeyman whose long career as an aerospace engineer brought him to his current workplace, Blue Origin. And yet, they still came to Inspiration4 as spaceflight novices. That meant TRISH researchers had to come up with a testing suite that could be performed with minimal training. The Inspiration4 crew also wore Apple Watches, and the capsule was outfitted with environmental sensors that researchers were able to correlate to the other testing results. Correlating the data is \u201cunusual,\u201d Dr. Donoviel said, but it gave researchers unique insights into how changes in the confined environment affected things like heart rate or cognitive performance.\u00a0 Overall, researchers are trying to move toward digitizing testing and making more of the data-gathering passive, to lower the cognitive overhead on the private astronaut. (NASA astronauts also take cognitive tests, but they are using a very old test developed in the 1970s, Dr. Donoviel said.)\u00a0 Gathering such information will be critical as the number of private citizens heading to space increases, as it seems almost certainly poised to do in the coming decade. Researchers will be better able to understand the effects of spaceflight on people that don\u2019t fit the mold of the typical NASA astronaut: male, white and in the top percentiles for physical and cognitive performance. But they\u2019ll only be able to do so if the future space tourists are willing to collect the data.\u00a0 More data means a better understanding of how spaceflight affects women versus men, or could help future space tourists with pre-existing conditions understand how they will fare in the zero-G environment. The results from Inspiration4 are promising, especially for space tourism: TRISH\u2019s paper found, based on the data from that mission, short-duration missions do not pose significant health risks. This latest preliminary finding adds to existing data that longer-term stints in space \u2014 in this case, 340 days \u2014 may not be as dangerous as once presumed. So far, commercial providers ranging from Axiom Space to SpaceX to Blue Origin have been more than willing to work with TRISH, and agreed to standardize and pool the data collected on their respective missions, Dr. Donoviel said. \u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re all competing for these people [as customers], but this allows them to contribute to a common knowledge base,\u201d she added. \u00a0 This is only the beginning. The rise in non-governmental spaceflight missions raises major questions related to the norms, ethics and regulation of human research in space. While more private citizens are likely headed to space than ever before, will they be interested in being guinea pigs in order to further scientific research? Will a private astronaut paying $50 million for a luxury space tourism experience want to spend their time in orbit conducting ultrasounds on themselves or meticulously measuring their temporary cognitive decline?\u00a0 Possibly; possibly not. Last year, Donoviel co-published an article in Science calling for, among other things, the development of a set of principles to guide commercial spaceflight missions. One of those principles the authors called for is social responsibility \u2014 essentially, the idea that private astronauts arguably have a heightened social responsibility to advance this research. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to space, you\u2019re resting on the laurels of all of the public funding that has enabled you to go to space. The taxpayers paid for all of those space capabilities that have now enabled you to go to space. So you owe the taxpayers the research,\u201d Dr. Donoviel argued. She added that advances in wearable tech have only lowered the burden on the research participants \u2014 not just with the Apple Watch, but with tech like the Biobutton device that continuously collects many vital signs or a sweat patch. \u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it miserable for you, we\u2019re not going to poke you with a needle, we\u2019re not going to make you do an ultrasound, but wear the Biobutton and put on the sweat patch.\u201d\u00a0 The story has been updated to reflect that Dr. Donoviel works at Baylor College of Medicine, not Baylor University, and that NASA\u2019s cognitive tests were developed in the 1970s.

The most widespread type of battery, lithium-ion, still costs around $140 per kilowatt-hour for a pack. While that\u2019s low enough to have triggered quickening adoption of electric vehicles, even the cheapest lithium-ion chemistries are still too expensive to put a big battery in every home to protect against blackouts. Instead, manufacturers have started to explore sodium-ion batteries, not as a replacement, but as a complement to lithium-ion.\u00a0 \u201cWhen produced at the same scale, sodium-ion should be about half of where lithium-iron-phosphate is in terms of cost to produce because the raw materials are a hundred times cheaper,\u201d Darren Tan, co-founder and CEO of Unigrid, told TechCrunch. Despite the promise, sodium-ion isn\u2019t quite ready for widespread use. Batteries made with it are not very dense, making them too large and too heavy for EVs. Plus, many variants behave differently from lithium-ion when they\u2019re charging and discharging, meaning packs made with sodium-ion need new electronics to manage them. Tan\u2019s startup thinks it has solved those problems by using a new chemistry based on sodium-chromium-oxide in one half of the battery and tin in the other (though Tan emphasizes the company can substitute other materials on either side). Unigrid\u2019s batteries don\u2019t take up any more space than a lithium-iron-phosphate cell, sometimes less. Plus, their power output mimics that of lithium-ion so the company can use the same electronics, and they are made with widely available materials. \u201cChromium is produced at twice the quantity of copper each year,\u201d Tan said. The company was born out of Tan\u2019s research at UC San Diego, where he was a doctoral student under Shirley Meng, a prolific materials scientist who focuses on energy storage. Their goal wasn\u2019t just to create a cheaper battery, but also one that\u2019s safer. Unigrid\u2019s batteries won\u2019t go into thermal runaway and catch fire until the internal temperature rises to several hundred degrees Celsius, Tan said. \u201cSodium-ion should not just be like lithium-ion, it should be way safer such that we can put it in buildings, hospitals, data centers, so we can achieve widespread distributed energy storage,\u201d he said. To deliver that many batteries, Unigrid isn\u2019t going to be building its own factories. Instead, it\u2019ll be working with smaller battery manufacturers that exist simply to make other companies\u2019 designs. Think of them like TSMC, which produces computer chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia, albeit much smaller in scale. Unigrid\u2019s chemistry works on their existing equipment, and Tan said there\u2019s enough spare capacity at these facilities to produce batteries on a megawatt-hour scale. Unigrid\u2019s first market will be energy storage for buildings and small campuses, but it\u2019s also looking to supply manufacturers of so-called light EVs, things like scooters, motorcycles and tuk-tuks. Small vehicles like these are popular in India and Southeast Asia, where the intense heat can make lithium-ion batteries prone to overheating. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity there where the climate is very warm and lots of battery fires occur,\u201d Tan said. To get its sodium-ion batteries into production, Unigrid has raised a $12 million Series A. The round was led by Transition VC and Ritz Venture Capital, with participation from Union Square Ventures and Foothill Ventures.\u00a0 Tan hopes that Unigrid will be selling cells sooner than later. \u201cWe really wanted to do something that could make a more immediate and shorter-term impact, something that we could get into the market in the next five years,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s also increasing the limit for video call participants to up to 32 people. In August last year, WhatsApp introduced screen-sharing support for video calls. The instant messaging app has now enhanced that experience by enabling support to share audio alongside your screen. This will let you watch videos with your contacts on a WhatsApp call. The other significant update that WhatsApp has made to its video calling is the expanded limit, which allows users to have up to 32 people on a single video call across devices. Before this update, WhatsApp had a 32-participant limit on mobile devices, while users on Windows and macOS could add up to 16 and 8 participants, respectively. WhatsApp\u2019s expanded video calling support across devices aligns with Apple\u2019s FaceTime, which also allows iPhone and iPad users to have up to 32 participants on video calls. However, Google Meet and Zoom allow users to have up to 100 people even when they are on the basic tier. The latest slew of updates on WhatsApp also brings the speaker spotlight to automatically highlight the participant who\u2019s talking on a video call and make them appear first on the screen. Additionally, WhatsApp parent Meta introduced the Meta Low Bitrate (MLow) codec on WhatsApp to improve call reliability even if the user has poor network connectivity or uses an older device. It comes as a significant upgrade to the open source codec Opus, which Meta earlier deployed across its real-time communication products. The proprietary codec is rated to deliver twice the audio quality of Opus even while keeping 10% lower computational complexity than that of the open source codec. MLow is already available on Instagram and Messenger calls and is now rolling out on WhatsApp to enhance the calling experience across Meta platforms. Alongside MLow, WhatsApp said in a blog post that it will roll out all the latest calling-related updates to all eligible users over the next few weeks.

The investment, roughly $80 million of which will fund Amazon\u2019s second AWS Generative AI Accelerator program, aims to position AWS as an attractive cloud infrastructure choice for startups developing generative AI models to power their products, apps and services. Much of the new tranche \u2014 including the entire portion set aside for the accelerator program \u2014 comes in the form of compute credits for AWS infrastructure, meaning that it can\u2019t be transferred to other cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. To sweeten the pot, Amazon is pledging that startups in this year\u2019s Generative AI Accelerator cohort will gain access to experts and tech from Nvidia, the program\u2019s presenting partner. They will also be invited to join the Nvidia Inception program, which provides companies opportunities to connect with potential investors and additional consulting resources. The Generative AI Accelerator program has also grown substantially. Last year\u2019s cohort, which had 21 startups, received only up to $300,000 in AWS compute credits, amounting to around a combined $6.3 million investment. \u201cWith this new effort, we will help startups launch and scale world-class businesses, providing the building blocks they need to unleash new AI applications that will impact all facets of how the world learns, connects, and does business,\u201d Matt Wood, VP of AI products at AWS, said in a statement.  Amazon\u2019s growing spending on generative AI tech, which includes efforts like its $100 million AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, free credits for startups using major AI models and its Project Olympus model, comes as the company looks to catch up to tech giant rivals in the blooming \u2014 and increasingly competitive \u2014 generative AI space. While Amazon claims that its various generative AI businesses have reached \u201cmultiple billions\u201d in run rate, the company is widely perceived as having missed the boat on generative AI. AWS originally planned to unveil its own generative AI model akin to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT code-named Bedrock \u2014 which eventually became Amazon\u2019s\u00a0Bedrock\u00a0model hosting service \u2014 at its annual conference in November 2022, according to The Information. But major bugs forced the organization to postpone the launch. (Amazon PR disputes this.)  Amazon\u2019s Alexa division has been beset with challenges as well, thanks to technical setbacks and political infighting, as reported by Fortune\u2019s Sharon Goldman this week. Nine months after a splashy press demo of a \u201cnext-gen\u201d Alexa, the new Alexa is reportedly far from ready for prime time \u2014 the result of insufficient training data, inadequate access to training hardware and other roadblocks. Amazon also passed on early opportunities to back two leading AI startups, Cohere and Anthropic. The company later tried to invest in Cohere, but was rejected \u2014 and had to settle for a co-investment (albeit a\u00a0large one, totaling $4 billion) in Anthropic with chief rival Google.\u00a0 Besides the recent departure of Howard Wright, AWS\u2019 head of startups, who managed startup relationships at the org, a hurdle in Amazon\u2019s way is growing scrutiny from regulators over Big Tech\u2019s investments in AI startups. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently opened an inquiry on Microsoft\u2019s backing of OpenAI, as well as Google and Amazon\u2019s investments in Anthropic. European policymakers have signaled they\u2019re skeptical of such deals as well. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

All rights reserved.

Accessed by swiping down on the middle of the Home Screen, Spotlight Search already helps iPhone users discover things on their device and on the web \u2014 the latter as an alternative to using Google Search. With iOS 18, Apple is making it easier for people to discover the content inside their apps using natural language \u2014 or \u201csemantic\u201d \u2014 queries. Already, Spotlight has been able to search for content in developers\u2019 apps, but it would only return results when search terms matched exactly. With this year\u2019s addition of semantic search capabilities, people will be able to search for content in apps using search terms that are similar in meaning, Apple told developers at WWDC 2024 this week. With the Core Spotlight framework, developers can donate content they want to make searchable via Spotlight, which is stored in a private index on users\u2019 devices that other apps cannot access. With the new semantic capabilities, Spotlight\u2019s understanding of developers\u2019 content will be much improved as users will be able to search for content inside apps in their own way. These types of search queries leverage machine learning models that are downloaded to the device and run in the app\u2019s process and can be loaded or unloaded at any time, Apple said. In addition, as Spotlight search is used, developers can help to improve the rankings of their app\u2019s search results over time by sending signals to Spotlight when an iPhone owner engages with one of their results.  For example, if someone were searching for a particular local hiking trail, the semantic search capabilities would be able to find results related to the user\u2019s search query, using entities it understood like the trail\u2019s location or specific keywords, even if they weren\u2019t in the trail\u2019s name and were not exact matches. Plus, the developer can set higher priorities for some of their content, as needed. This allows them to do things like mark a trail that a user had saved as a favorite to rank higher in the search results. The end result is that the person searches for a given trail using a natural language query in Spotlight, finds the trail they want more easily via these improved results, then can tap on a result to be taken straight to the trail\u2019s page in the developer\u2019s hiking trails app. This update also helps Siri better understand an app\u2019s content, Apple noted.  While not as exciting as an AI-powered Siri or ChatGPT integration, this type of under-the-hood update will make for an improved experience for iPhone users who turn to Spotlight to find information from their apps \u2014 or even for those who use Spotlight as an alternative to web search.

Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility! Kirsten Korosec is still off on holiday, so you\u2019ve got me once again! Today is the big Tesla shareholder vote. We\u2019ll finally get to learn, among other things, whether investors think Elon Musk deserves his $56 billion pay package. And if they don\u2019t, will Musk make good on his threats and leave Tesla so he can focus on xAI or SpaceX or just X?! You\u2019ve probably seen the breathless and thirsty pleas from Tesla board members, shareholders and Musk himself asking investors to vote in favor of the compensation package. Musk and his supporters have claimed that he is owed such astronomical wealth because he hit whatever agreed-upon targets they say he hit. But before the shareholder vote commences, we think it\u2019s worth a second look at why Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick struck down the \u201cre-ratification\u201d of the package in January.\u00a0 Her dominant theme? Musk holds so much sway over Tesla and its board of directors that there was no substantial negotiation when the company hammered out this deal with him in 2017-2018. We\u2019ll be watching and reporting, so check back in for updates.\u00a0 \u2014 Rebecca Bellan A little bird came to senior reporter Sean O\u2019Kane and told him that Ford was poaching employees at EV startup Canoo. That led O\u2019Kane down the rabbit hole of LinkedIn, where he learned Ford has been quite busy scooping up talent across competitors and tech giants like Rivian, Tesla, Formula 1 and Apple. The upshot? Ford is capitalizing on the recent chaos in the auto industry to build out its secretive low-cost EV team.\u00a0 Got a tip for us?

General Motors is giving Cruise an $850 million lifeline as the robotaxi company slowly starts re-entering markets. The money is sort of a bridge to help Cruise fund its daily operations until it can \u201cfind the right long-term capital efficient strategy, including new partnerships and external funding.\u201d\u00a0 While this does seem like a large capital outlay, particularly since GM has already invested over $8 billion in Cruise, that $850 million is hundreds of millions lower than the automaker likely would have spent on Cruise this year. GM told investors at the end of last year that it would slash spending on Cruise following a series of safety incidents that culminated in Cruise grounding its entire fleet in November 2023. Other deals that got my attention\u00a0\u2026 Descartes, a logistics company, has acquired BoxTop Technologies, a provider of shipment management solutions for small- to midsized logistics service providers for $13 million, the company told TechCrunch via email. FLO, an EV charging network operator, has secured $136 million in long-term capital, mainly from a Series E round led by Export Development Canada. The funds will help FLO accelerate deployment of its charging network in the U.S. and Canada and advance the rollout of its new charging products, according to a statement from the startup.\u00a0 Fly E-Bike, a NYC-based e-bike retailer focused on last-mile food delivery, went public on the Nasdaq last week at an opening price of $4.78 per share. The stock has since dipped nearly 20%. General Motors\u2019 board approved a new share buyback plan to repurchase up to $6 billion of outstanding common stock to create more upside for investors, according to a press release. The automaker also increased its stock dividend 33%, from $0.09 to $0.12 per share, in the first quarter.\u00a0 Tern AI\u2019s positioning system aims to provide a low-cost alternative to GPS. The startup just raised a $4.4 million seed round from Scout Ventures, Shadow Capital, Bravo Victor VC and Veteran Fund. Belgian transport and logistics management startup Qargo has raised $14 million in a Series A led by Balderton Capital. Qargo\u2019s goal is to help the logistics industry digitize to create efficiencies, reduce costs and bring down emissions.\u00a0 Autonomous vehicles Aside from scoring funding from GM, Cruise also announced that it\u2019s back in Houston with a small fleet of vehicles. They will have a human safety driver behind the wheel as Cruise slowly and painstakingly revalidates its technology.\u00a0 May Mobility will launch an autonomous shuttle service in Detroit for residents with disabilities or who are 65 and older. Starting June 20, May will deploy three AVs, two of which are wheelchair-accessible, to help participants get to healthcare facilities, shopping centers, work and social activities.\u00a0\u00a0 Waymo issued its second recall after one of its robotaxis in Phoenix drove into a telephone pole. Waymo updated the software on its over 600 vehicles as they returned to the depot for regular maintenance and recharging.  Electric vehicles, charging & batteries Aptera is the perfect example of how crowdfunding can go wrong. The startup raised over $100 million from retail investors who were reeled in by flashy social media campaigns. So far, Aptera has nothing to show for it.\u00a0 The European Commission has concluded that the Chinese EV industry suffers from unfair subsidization that makes it a threat to EU EV producers. So it\u2019s slapping more tariffs on Chinese EVs. For example, BYD would see a 17.4% duty, Geely\u2019s would be 20%, and SAIC\u2019s a whopping 38.1%. Well, we certainly saw this coming. Fisker has issued its first recall for its troubled Ocean SUV due to problems with the warning lights. The recall comes as Fisker is on the brink of bankruptcy and has cut its workforce to the bone.\u00a0 Rivian at first seemed like it was a little all over the place. But with the revamped version of its first two consumer vehicles (which you can read more about below!) that are built more efficiently and Rivian\u2019s decision to set aside plans to build a factory in Georgia, the EV startup\u2019s path to survival is becoming more clear. Ride-hail\u00a0 Revel launched an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hail service in New York City in 2021. Now the company is ditching the employee model in favor of a gig worker model akin to competitors Lyft and Uber. In the process, Revel will have to lay off its 1,000 driver employees.\u00a0 What is \u201cThis week\u2019s wheels\u201d? It\u2019s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we\u2019re testing, whether it\u2019s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.\u00a0 Before Kirsten went on holiday, she gave Rivian\u2019s revamped R1T and R1S a drive. Let\u2019s see what she learned.\u00a0 I recently got behind the wheel of the next-generation Rivian R1T and R1S. For those who want a deep dive, you can read my story about why this refresh matters and what new parts and features customers can expect.\u00a0 For folks looking for the highlights, here are a few quick notes on some important changes.\u00a0 The ride quality, specifically the road noise and suspension, are much improved in the next-gen R1 line. The ride quality in the first-generation R1S has been a source of complaints, so this improvement couldn\u2019t not have come at a better time.\u00a0 I also had a chance to test the advanced driver-assistance system. First-gen R1 vehicles also have ADAS, but this one is supported by lots of new sensors, compute and software. The automaker is calling it the \u201cRivian Autonomy Platform,\u201d but I won\u2019t be because I\u2019m a stickler for what is and what is not autonomy. This is a hands-on system for now and the driver is always expected to be in control.\u00a0 That being said, there is a lot of capability here. The perception stack includes 11 cameras, five radars, compute that is 10 times more powerful than what\u2019s in the first-gen vehicles and what the company describes as \u201cAI prediction technology.\u201d And this system comes standard.\u00a0 Rivian will also offer a premium version of the system, called Rivian Autonomy Platform+. I had a chance to test one feature in this premium version called \u201cLane Change on Command.\u201d The feature, which is only available on divided highways, will move the vehicle into another lane if the driver hits the signal indicator. The feature worked, although I noticed that it took a moment for the vehicle to settle into the center of the lane.\u00a0 Rivian says more automated driving features will roll out on this premium system in the months to come.\u00a0 Correction: Waymo has clarified that its recall did not involve an over-the-air software update.

Dave Burke, VP of engineering at Android, said on Thursday that he is stepping down from the role after 14 years. However, he is not leaving Alphabet and will be exploring \u201cAI\/bio\u201d projects within the company. Burke was involved in pivotal projects at Android, including the Nexus and Pixel phones, developing Chrome for mobile phones, starting Android TV, and spearheading efforts to build and ship developer tools. Burke\u2019s move follows a slew of layoffs and restructuring at Alphabet this year. In January, the company laid off more than 1,000 employees, including most of its AR hardware team, and in April, Google combined its hardware and Android teams to focus on bringing AI to all its devices. That latter decision led to Hiroshi Lockheimer, who had headed Android, Chrome and ChromeOS, exploring other roles in the company, and Rick Osterloh, SVP of devices and services, was brought on to oversee the new division. Sameer Samat, who worked under Lockheimer, became the president of Android Ecosystem. In a post on X, Burke said that he would continue as an adviser as he looks for another project. So\u2026 after 14 yrs leading Android engineering, I've decided it's time for a change. An awe-inspiring ride helping build the biggest OS on the planet (+ many Nexus\/Pixel). I'm forever grateful for the opp. Continuing as advisor while figuring out what's next in AI\/bio. More here:\u2026 In a letter to his colleagues, which Burke also published on LinkedIn, he said he wanted to explore the role of AI in boosting drug discovery. \u201cAI has the potential to play a pivotal role in accelerating drug discovery, with wide applicability, including in hard-to-treat pediatric cancers, a topic close to my heart. I\u2019m working with Sundar to explore relevant roles at Alphabet,\u201d he said. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

Search results are based on the Brave Search API and Leo is integrated into the company\u2019s browser. The company said that this integration will help users find more up-to-date information. People can use this integration to fetch information like the latest scores, pull more context related to the topic while reading an article and search recent and relevant topics to create social media posts. Brave emphasized that the integration is privacy-forward because the company doesn\u2019t require users to log in. Plus, it doesn\u2019t store your conversations with the AI chatbot on its server. Brave said it doesn\u2019t use the responses to train its model. The company added that it sends requests to an anonymization server first to hide a user\u2019s identity. You can also purchase Leo Premium at $14.99\/month, which gives you higher rate limits and access to the latest models. The company said it issues unlinkable tokens when you buy the subscription to prevent any personal identification.  Brave has tried to build its AI capability to attract more users to its browser and search engine. The company launched AI-powered summarization for its search product last year to show users the gist of answers to a search query. It also made the Leo AI Assistant available to everyone in November 2023. In April, the company introduced an AI Answer engine to search to answer users\u2019 queries. Other browsers such as Edge, Opera, Arc and SigmaOS have integrated AI to varying degrees. Brave likely wants to use its advantage of owning both a browser and search stack to refine its product.

The model will be built from scratch and will be trained exclusively on Getty Images\u2019 licensed creative content. The company says the partnership will enable Picsart subscribers to generate their own unique images, with full commercial rights. Users will be able to use any of Picsart\u2019s editing tools to add to or customize the assets.\u00a0 By creating its own model trained exclusively on licensed content, Picsart plans to give its users access to safe AI creative tools at a time when there are rising concerns regarding AI-generated images and copyright issues.

The team will make the model accessible through the company\u2019s own API services.\u00a0 \u201cPicsart offers endless customization, content, and editing tools for everything from social media ads to website graphics, and this partnership will enable commercially usable AI-generated imagery from a world-class brand,\u201d said Picsart CEO and founder Hovhannes Avoyan, in a statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with Getty Images, the most prestigious commercial library out there, to bring this to market.\u201d Picsart plans to launch the model later this year.\u00a0 The company is also integrating Getty Images video content into Picsart\u2019s platform and making it available to Plus members.

Each year Apple kicks off its Worldwide Developers Conference with a few hours of just straight announcements, like the long-awaited Apple Intelligence and a makeover for smart AI assistant, Siri. We expected much of them to revolve around the company\u2019s artificial intelligence ambitions (and here), and Apple didn\u2019t disappoint. We also bring you news about Vision Pro and lots of feature refreshes.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how to watch the archive of WWDC 2024. Developers should expect hardware and software updates, per the usual, and some other items we initially thought would be unveiled. Brian Heater also went on Equity to dish. Now sit back and relax while the team runs down all of the biggest news in an easy-to-skim digest. Apple is making it easier for people to discover the content inside their apps using natural language \u2014 or \u201csemantic\u201d \u2014 queries. Already, Spotlight has been able to search for content in developers\u2019 apps, but it would only return results when search terms matched exactly. With this year\u2019s addition of semantic search capabilities, people will be able to search for content in apps using search terms that are just similar in meaning. Read more Now that people are using developer betas and exploring the sessions at the event, more features that were not announced onstage are surfacing. Remember that\u00a0only certain devices will be compatible\u00a0with iOS 18 when it\u2019s released later in the fall. Read more Instead, Apple is adding a new two-step permissions pop-up screen that will first ask users to allow or deny access to their contacts, as before, and then, if the user allows access, will allow them to choose which contacts they want to share, if not all. Read more Brian Heater writes about consistently requesting this certain feature from Apple: the ability to pause your activity rings. If you\u2019re down due to a cold, on an international flight, or find that you\u2019re vigorously shaking your wrist at 9 p.m. just to finish closing your rings, you can now pause progress via the Watch or through the connected iPhone app. Read more Apple has been on a spree of late, announcing a host of new features for its various devices earlier this week. But a lot of those features were already available to some extent on Apple devices through third-party apps. So, just like the past few years, we will examine the ideas that Apple \u201cSherlocked\u201d in this year\u2019s updates. Read more The company has since revealed some of what makes its approach to generative AI different. First and foremost is scope. Many of the most prominent companies in the space take a \u201cbigger is better\u201d approach to their models. Read more Instead of trying to overwhelm users\u00a0with too many AI features to count, the Cupertino tech giant is carefully rolling out AI where it believes it could be useful. That means the tech won\u2019t be included where it could be much of a threat to the carefully crafted consumer experience of using an Apple device. Read more Apple delivered two of the biggest features iMessage and its Messages app that consumers were wanting for a long time: the ability to schedule messages to send at a later date and time and support for\u00a0RCS, the next-gen messaging standard and replacement for SMS that will make texting with Android folks much less painful. Is it the end of the green bubbles? Read more Apple is giving developers more tools to increase their app revenues and promote their apps with win-back offers and the release of a new commerce API. Read more Among the highlights of the new operating system version are a set of\u00a0customization options, such as being able to arrange apps and widgets on the Home Screen and customize buttons. Other features include new text effects,\u00a0the ability to lock and hide apps, new ways to manage your Mail inbox, the introduction of\u00a0iMessages over satellite,\u00a0a significant redesign of the Photos app\u00a0and more. Now let\u2019s see if your device is compatible. Read more There was a lot, wasn\u2019t there? Apple\u2019s AI push was at the heart of WWDC 2024, and our AI expert Kyle Wiggers took some time to process all of the announcements before bringing together a guide to all of the news across Siri, Genmoji, ChatGPT integrations, photo editing and beyond. Read more In a post-keynote event, Apple SVP Craig Federighi confirmed that the company would work with other third-party models beyond OpenAI, with Google\u2019s Gemini model being highlighted as the first example. He clarified that Apple had \u201cnothing to announce right now, but that\u2019s our general direction.\u201d Read more  Tesla, SpaceX and xAI exec Elon Musk took to X to continue his campaign against rival OpenAI, threatening to ban Apple devices from his businesses \u201cif Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level,\u201d among other responses and reactions to the conversations around WWDC on X. Read more Before you get too excited about putting Apple Intelligence to the test, check if your devices are new enough. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, along with iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips, will be able to run the new features coming alongside Apple\u2019s AI push. Read more Apple is bringing ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot experience, to Siri and other Apple apps, powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and other generative AI models.\u00a0Read more One of the Apple Intelligence-powered features coming in iOS 18 will allow iPhone users to create AI images of people they\u2019re messaging with \u2014 a feature that works something like an AI-upgraded Bitmoji. The goal, of course, is to make your \u201ceveryday conversations more enjoyable.\u201d  Apple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you\u2019re talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly. Read more For those of you who use Apple TV+, there is a new feature called InSight. The feature will allow viewers to learn actor names and song titles as they appear on the screen.\u00a0Lauren Forristal writes that it\u2019s similar to Amazon\u2019s X-Ray technology, where Fire TV users get an overview of actor bios and behind-the-scenes information while watching TV shows and movies.  What stands out about InSight, however, is its Shazam-like functionality, which highlights the song playing in the TV show or movie and gives users the option to add it to an Apple Music playlist to listen to later.\u00a0Read more Apple also made some enhancements to its smart assistant, Siri. These include adding some generative AI features that make Siri seem more natural and more personal. There\u2019s also a new glowing light. And, Siri can also handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. Plus, for those who would rather type, you can do that now. Read more The new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences. \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,\u201d CEO Tim Cook noted at WWDC Monday. \u201cAnd of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d Read more That covers the consumer side of things, but WWDC is a conference for developers, and Apple revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software. A number of AI features will be added to existing SDKs, allowing for generative AI image generation, or new prompts to Siri, to allow devs to expand the Apple Intelligence footprint. Read more While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn\u2019t easy to figure out. Now, the company introduced a Passwords app. Some of the features include a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren\u2019t related to a website or service. Read more A new \u201cSmart Script\u201d feature will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil to write in Notes. Apple says it\u2019s making handwriting your notes even smoother and straighter. The feature improves the appearance of your writing as you write by using on-device machine learning to recreate your handwriting from your notes. You\u2019ll see your own handwriting, just smoother and more legible. Read more Who would have thought a calculator would liven up a developer\u2019s conference? Well, Apple\u2019s new Calculator for iPad app got everyone excited. iOS\u2019 perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn\u2019t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes. The additional feature does the math for you. Read more The latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia. One of the biggest features of this new OS is iPhone mirroring. Now, through macOS\u2019 Continuity feature, you can mirror your iPhone\u2019s screen and control it right from your Mac. Notifications on Mac pop you into iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well, but the paired iPhone stays locked while in mirror mode. Read more OK, let\u2019s do a little deeper dive into iPhone mirroring. While Apple didn\u2019t detail many use cases for the feature, Sarah Perez writes that it seems it would make it easier to demo apps over video calls or in person, as users could move between a slideshow presentation and a live demo of the iPhone app by launching it as if it\u2019s another app on your Mac. Read more This new feature works much like Apple\u2019s emergency SOS feature. When you have no signal, you\u2019ll be given the option to find a satellite to relay the data. You\u2019ll have to keep the phone pointed in the right direction while you do it, however, there\u2019s an overlay above your messages to remind you. Read more Apple showed off the new Photos app as it will appear in the upcoming release of the iOS software. The new app introduces new navigation, new organizational features and other ways to discover your favorite photos, including those of friends, family, pets, trips and more. Some things to know: The new design will lead to less time searching for photos as it puts everything you need within easy reach. One major change involves how the app has been unified into a single view with the photo grid at the top and the library, organized by theme, below. Read more One of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones. As Brian Heater writes, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay\u2019s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device\u2019s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info \u2014 a nice added privacy element. Read more Users will now be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When you lock an app, if someone tries to tap your phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. While you have the app lock feature enabled, information from inside the app won\u2019t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Read more Apple also shared some initial details for the upcoming major release of iOS, which is its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. As expected, much of this involves artificial intelligence. Remember when icons were locked to the grid? Well, they can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don\u2019t hide your background photos. \u201ciOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,\u201d Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. Read more Speaking of icons, most of these updates are those long-requested functionalities, like the ability to set app icons and widgets wherever you want on the Home Screen, plus support for dark mode icons with different color schemes.\u00a0Read more visionOS 2 brings with it productivity enhancements and \u201cnew immersive experiences.\u201d One lets you \u201cspatialize\u201d photos from regular photos, leveraging AI tech. Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to bring up the control center with notifications, shortcuts and more. Read more One of the bigger announcements with this includes the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. Read more For those of you outside of the U.S., the Vision Pro headset will be available in eight new countries. Read more Apple has fallen behind its peers in the AI race, and it probably feels like it needs to pull out all the stops to impress fans and shareholders. But that shouldn\u2019t mean overpromising on features. Read more For smart assistants: While rumors point to the company transitioning a number of employees to generative AI operations following its\u00a0electric car implosion, all signs point to Apple having ceded a significant head start to the competition. As such, its most logical play is a partnership with a reigning powerhouse like OpenAI. Read more Maybe not for iPhone 15: Some other rumors say that when this generative AI comes into play, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro. That means the standard iPhone 15 may be left out in the cold on this one. Read more Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

It will also begin testing generative AI ads, the company said. The launch of Creative Lab shows that Spotify is ramping up its efforts to attract advertisers to the platform. This could likely be an attractive offering for marketers, as they\u2019ll be able to reach Spotify\u2019s 615 million listeners.\u00a0 Additionally, Spotify is working on a new AI tool for advertisers: \u201cQuick Audio,\u201d which enables brands to create scripts and voiceovers using generative AI. A company spokesperson told us the tool will soon launch in Spotify Ads Managers.\u00a0 A Spotify exec had earlier said the company was looking to use AI to generate host-read ads for podcasters.  Brands will be able to work with the new Creative Lab team to produce things like video and audio ads, in-app digital experiences and other interactive ad formats like call-to-action (CTA) cards, the spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cEvery campaign Creative Lab touches is highly customized to each specific brand and business need,\u201d the spokesperson said. Spotify used client Rockstar Energy Drink as an example, which launched a \u201cPress Play\u201d livestreamed concert series within the music streaming app, featuring artists like British rapper Stormzy. Another beverage company, Aperol, will also be a Creative Lab client.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

The company, also TechCrunch\u2019s parent, recently launched AI-powered features for Yahoo Mail, including its own take on Gmail\u2019s Priority Inbox and AI summaries of emails, and today it\u2019s rolling out an AI-powered version of its Yahoo News app, leveraging technology it acquired from its latest acquisition, Artifact. Still, Yahoo has more AI plans in the works, including for its Yahoo News property on the web. Code references on the newly redesigned Yahoo News website indicated that Yahoo is testing an AI summaries feature, presumably as a way to allow visitors to quickly catch up on the news without having to read articles in their entirety.  However, while the Yahoo News app is taking learnings from Artifact when it comes to offering AI features, the AI summaries feature found on Yahoo News is not related to its acquisition of the well-liked AI news app that had been created by Instagram\u2019s founders, but had shut down after failing to reach a wider audience. Reached for comment, Yahoo confirmed that its AI summaries on the web have been available in testing for a few months, but those tests are occurring on a small, single-digit percentage of article pages on the Yahoo News web experience, the company told TechCrunch. That would explain why most visitors to the Yahoo News website would not have likely encountered these AI summaries as of yet. The code doesn\u2019t reveal much about the underlying technology Yahoo is using for the AI summaries, only how they would appear to site visitors \u2014 in a lightbox, a type of web component used for displaying content. Yahoo declined to share more about the technology itself or when it would launch publicly. The company does have a partnership with OpenAI for its Yahoo News mobile app, though. Combined with the Artifact-inspired revamp of Yahoo News and the AI features that arrived on Yahoo Mail, it\u2019s clear that Yahoo is betting on AI to give its older web products and services a push. Whether simply adding AI will attract a new audience, of course, remains to be seen.  Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

And over the last few months, Elon Musk engaged. Every time he did, Tesla\u2019s legal team had to get to work, writing and submitting regulatory filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It\u2019s all part of an effort to say that, this time, when the shareholders vote to approve his monster $56 billion compensation package, they were fully informed.  The Delaware judge who rescinded the 2018 pay package in January did so in part because shareholders weren\u2019t fully informed on the stockholder vote due to inaccurate proxy statements. So in the run-up to this vote \u2014 which will be finalized at Thursday\u2019s annual shareholder meeting \u2014 Tesla has clearly wanted to cover as many bases as possible by over-sharing anything Musk posted about or engaged with. Here they are transcribing a five-minute video from TeslaBoomerMama video that Musk shared on X, where she pleaded with shareholders to vote \u201cyes.\u201d Here they are filing a video Musk shared of Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos from 2018 supporting the original compensation plan, which was posted by an account the Anti-Defamation League says promotes QAnon. Here they are posting a screenshot of a post of support from Musk\u2019s former divorce lawyer, and Tesla\u2019s former general counsel, Todd Maron. Here they are, in the final week before the vote, piling dozens of screenshots of posts Musk interacted with into one very long filing. None of these filings are signed, so it\u2019s not clear who has been doing all this work. Musk has a bone-deep habit of behaving in a way that creates billable hours, so some of this is to be expected. But this push to \u201cre-ratify\u201d his compensation package has had Tesla\u2019s regulatory team busier than maybe ever. In terms of just raw filings, Tesla has submitted more to the SEC in the last three months than it has at any point in the last five years:  Strip out all the filings related to executives and institutional investors buying and selling shares, as well as all letters to and from the SEC, and Tesla has been submitting more filings than in any time since before the \u201cfunding secured\u201d mess in 2018: This is all set against the backdrop of an unrelenting get-out-the-vote effort from Tesla\u2019s biggest fans over the last few months. They\u2019ve posted countless calls-to-action, have coordinated via direct messages on Musk\u2019s X platform to help shareholders figure out how to vote and more. Tesla and its employees have joined in, too. The company posted photos of its Optimus robot prototype filling out a vote card. It published a rosy timeline of the company\u2019s accomplishments since the plan was originally voted on in 2018. It even spun up an entire website dedicated to promoting the shareholder meeting, including a video from Tesla chair Robyn Denholm \u2014 who, until this recent push, rarely made public appearances on behalf of the company.  Many of its top executives voiced support, including some who have rarely used X. Tesla VP of Supply Chain Karn Budhiraj, who has only ever posted about a dozen times on X, wrote, \u201cElon is the driving force at Tesla and is critical for the future of the company.\u201d Tom Zhu, who was recently moved back to China amid Tesla\u2019s larger restructuring, wrote that the company has a \u201cvast vision beneath the surface that requires Elon\u2019s wisdom, courage, and decisiveness to achieve.\u201d Grace Tao, a high-ranking employee who leads communications in China and reportedly manages Tesla\u2019s relationship with the government there, also posted (on Weibo) about Musk\u2019s \u201cwisdom, courage, and determination.\u201d  Vanishingly few of the company\u2019s employees or its supporters actually touched on the substance of the judge\u2019s opinion that got us here: that Musk\u2019s undeniable sway over Tesla and its board meant the process leading up to the pay package was inherently unfair. But the effort has nonetheless helped Tesla\u2019s shareholders reinforce the narrative around the company (and its stock) that Tesla is nothing without Musk, and that he deserves the compensation package he testified he essentially negotiated with himself. Since the fight over Musk\u2019s pay package and the re-incorporation to Texas is likely headed for months of legal challenges, that might be victory enough for now.  In fact, they\u2019re already celebrating as the votes are being tallied. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

Albedo\u2019s first satellite will take to orbit next spring as the company","date":"2024-06-14T22:19:00Z","content":"Comment Satellite imagery startup Albedo is preparing for its up-close-and-personal debut. Albedo\u2019s first satellite will take to orbit next spring as the company looks to turn the commercial Earth observation industry upside down with its novel approach and ultra-high-resolution cameras.\u00a0 The satellite, called Clarity, will hitch a ride to very low Earth orbit (VLEO) on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-13 ride-share mission. That mission is currently set to launch no earlier than February 2025, so Albedo should have its first satellite operating in orbit this time next year.\u00a0 Albedo additionally announced seven customers that reserved a portion of Clarity\u2019s image tasking, including satellite imagery broker SkyFi and German energy company Open Grid Europe.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive schedule,\u201d Albedo CEO Topher Haddad said. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re posting a satellite mockup publicly. I think a lot of people probably think we\u2019re more of a small satellite, but it\u2019s a pretty complex robotic system with a large aperture telescope, and a pretty powerful capability. A lot of that timeline was mostly driven by the custom technology we\u2019ve been developing to fly a high-res system in VLEO.\u201d The startup is developing a first-of-its-kind spacecraft capable of capturing extremely high-resolution imagery, operating in very low Earth orbit \u2014 images so sharp, the company claims, that they\u2019ve historically been the exclusive purview of American defense and intelligence organizations.  The company says it will be able to sell 10-centimeter-per-pixel images to commercial and government customers at unprecedentedly low prices because of its unique \u2014 and quite large \u2014 satellite bus. (A 10-centimeter resolution image means that each pixel covers an area on the ground the size of 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters. The largest optical imagery providers today collect images at a 30-centimeter resolution, which is algorithmically improved to 15 centimeters.) Satellites that do collect 10-centimeter resolution tend to operate in higher orbital altitudes, like low Earth orbit, and by some estimates cost billions of dollars each to manufacture and launch.\u00a0Low Earth orbit is generally defined as the orbital band at an altitude of around 2,000 kilometers, while VLEO is between 250 and 450 kilometers. Albedo\u2019s satellites will be the size of refrigerators when all is said and done, which is much larger than many other commercial Earth observation satellites that are currently operating even farther away from Earth. It seems counterintuitive to make the satellites so heavy \u2014 one might think that to counter the increased atmospheric drag, it would be imperative to make the satellites as light as possible \u2014 but Haddad said in a recent interview that the company is able to counteract that drag using ultra-efficient electric propulsion and particular design decisions, like mounting the solar panels on the spacecraft instead of deploying them in two wings.\u00a0 \u201cYou normally deploy [the solar panels] because you can generate more power that way, but we needed to minimize the cross-sectional area so that that mass and that electric propulsion work out to give us the counteracting piece of the drag,\u201d Haddad explained. As the company moves toward putting hardware in orbit, it also brought on Kathryn Tobey as its first independent director on its now six-person board. Tobey had a 34-year career at Lockheed Martin, where she eventually became VP of the company\u2019s $3 billion Space, Special Programs line of business. (Prior to founding Albedo, Haddad cut his teeth at Lockheed Martin working on some of these same systems.) That division did high-tech national security work, including classified projects \u2014 exactly the customer set Albedo is aiming to target on the government side.\u00a0 \u201cShe brings both those superpowers, which I think is pretty rare to have, both that deep technical understanding, not just of satellites, but of our unique niche of high-performance imaging satellites, and the national security customer relationship and understanding that mission very well,\u201d Haddad said.\u00a0 Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

Two years later, it has amassed a following of women, nonbinary, and queer folks who have created a hopeful community based around its grimdark themes.","date":"2024-06-14T11:30:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Laurence Russell In late 2022, 3D animator Elizabeth Caingcoy completed the unheralded indie horror game Signalis and needed to talk to someone. Immediately. \u201cThe game resonated with me so intensely it was like I had to scream from the rooftops,\u201d she says. Over the next few months, she created a number of stunning fan animations celebrating the game, springboarding a new wave of appreciation among Signalis\u2019 queer fandom. Caingcoy\u2019s animations soon made their way to a fellow Southeast Asian 3D animator who creates under the name Atelier. Atelier became an even more prolific contributor to the community, establishing the fandom\u2019s reputation as a place for women, nonbinary, and queer folks to find hope and connect. The community was small, but mighty\u2014and growing. When it was released in 2022, Signalis picked up some awards and a few critical raves. But its most devoted players fell for it over time, desperate to unpack the feelings the game left them with. Its dark narrative hides a fragile, tragic lesbian romance that captivates all who discover it. Now, this fast-growing enclave has become notorious for celebrating the power of defiant queer love beyond the dystopian cosmic terror of Signalis itself. This devotion is evident in the numbers: In March, moderators of the game's subreddit surveyed more than 300 players and found that 38 percent identified as trans; 11 percent described themselves as questioning. Some 23 percent identified as gay or lesbian, 46 percent as bisexual or pansexual, and a further 20 percent recorded some kind of nonstraight answer. The question is, why has this eerie cocktail of cosmic horror and queerness struck such a chord? Developed by rose-engine, an indie studio in Hamburg, Germany, composed of just two developers, Yuri Stern and Barbara Wittmann, Signalis is a labor of love that was first conceived of more than 10 years ago. Most of its main characters are women looking for lost loved ones while being embattled by eldritch space terror. \u201cHorror has a unique power to confront and dissect our deepest fears, allowing us to confront them in a controlled environment,\u201d a cadre of Signalis\u2019 Reddit and Discord mods told WIRED in a statement. \u201cWhile romance can provide emotional catharsis, horror offers a different kind of release\u2014one that allows us to confront our fears, even finding solace in the shared experience of terror.\u201d Despite that, the community that has formed around Signalis embraces a hopepunk tone, choosing tenderness, resilience, and humor as its main themes. Fans have produced video essays with hundreds of thousands of views. Some 8,000 users populate its Discord, and its subreddit has collected more than 32,000 members. Beloved artists have drawn its characters. On April 28, the community produced a 97-page zine, created by an entirely female and nonbinary team. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Rose-Engine always had a fairly specific vision in mind for Signalis. The positive response to the prototypes spurred them on to create a distinctly refined experience. \u201cWe're happy that our game has resonated with a diverse community of fellow creative people,\u201d Stern and Wittmann wrote in a statement to WIRED. \u201cWe're also incredibly thankful for all the beautiful fan art that has been created for the game.\u201d Before playing Signalis, the pseudonymous artist Atelier had been an animator with 11 years of experience facing occupational burnout. \u201cIn many of those years I never got the chance to portray emotions like love, despite being queer myself and a fan of queer romance,\u201d she explains. Having produced dozens of heartfelt and exhilarating shorts, Atelier describes a very intense passion for bringing the game to life. \u201cI was creating so many in such a short time, the output was unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept making more because there was so much that I wanted to show with Signalis\u2019 characters.\u201d The plight of Signalis\u2019 \u201creplikas,\u201d the biosynthetic clones manufactured to emulate model workers and soldiers of an oppressive regime, particularly struck Caingcoy. \u201cIn spite of these rules, replikas make their own individuality, which has always moved me,\u201d she says. \u201cI relate to it heavily as a lesbian and trans woman, seeing myself as someone who had to claw myself out of an existence that wasn\u2019t true to me.\u201d \u201cI relate to it heavily as a lesbian and trans woman, seeing myself as someone who had to claw myself out of an existence that wasn\u2019t true to me.\u201d Speculative genres allow people to consider boundaries between the normative and what gender theorist Judith Butler and others call the \u201cconstitutive outside,\u201d allowing minoritized demographics to feel more seen, says Jennifer Dugan, an associate professor at the University of South-Eastern Norway who researches fan culture, specifically in relation to the trans experience. \u201cI speculate that Signalis\u2019 use of androids is a key reason why the game appeals to the trans population,\u201d says Dugan, referencing Donna Haraway\u2019s writings about cyborgs. Similarly, the horror themes speak to women because, as a genre, horror has long provided them with a way to reimagine their own troubling experiences. Grimdark fare, like that in Signalis, \u201callows for the translation of real-life trauma or pain into fantastical, metaphorical, heightened, or even just different terms,\u201d says Erika Kvistad, an English professor at USEN who specializes in horror and sexuality. Fans invert these dark themes into hopeful creations like those from Caingcoy and Atelier to develop \u201ca kind of familiarity or intimacy with the scary thing\u2014not making it harmless, but getting close to it, creating a relationship. Horror and love can be closely related feelings,\u201d Kvistad explains. Despite the game's release being more than a year ago, Signalis\u2019 fandom appears to be growing as more of the people it was made for discover it. Community projects include a full fan dub and a multiplayer mod for the game, the Silicon Queen fanfic alternate universe, a visual novel fan game, and a Signalis tarot deck. Rose-Engine\u2019s Wittmann and Stern say they enjoy the enthusiasm and creativity of the game\u2019s fans. Mostly. \u201cOur vision of the world of Signalis\u2019 is different than that of many fans,\u201d they write, \u201cand we definitely do not endorse any fan interpretations and fan works that, for example, depict the characters overly sexualized, infantilized, consuming drugs, or acting homophobic, all of which we\u2019ve sadly seen in the past.\u201d They also note they \u201ccurrently have no news to share\u201d regarding future work, a sign that any new Signalis game could be far off.

Aarian Marshall Morgan Meaker Under CEO Elon Musk, Tesla has been credited with revolutionizing the auto industry, jump-starting the electric revolution, and racking up billions in profit in the process. Now Musk is set for a record payday worth around $50 billion, after the electric car company\u2019s shareholders approved a compensation plan that had been previously blocked by a federal judge. The preliminary outcome of the vote was announced Thursday afternoon during an annual shareholder meeting at Tesla\u2019s newest auto and battery factory in Austin, Texas. The setting was apropos: Shareholders also approved a measure to move Tesla\u2019s corporate registration away from Delaware and to Texas. The company\u2019s board argued that Delaware\u2019s court system\u2014where a judge struck down Musk\u2019s pay scheme in January\u2014has been unfair to Tesla. \u201cHot damn, I love you guys,\u201d an ebullient Musk told shareholders from the stage of the meeting in Austin, after the pay package approval was announced. This vote was a referendum on Musk\u2019s leadership at Tesla, as some shareholders argued the CEO has grown more visibly distracted with his other companies, which include SpaceX, the tunneling venture the Boring Company, the social media site X, and the artificial intelligence firm xAI. The electric car company has also lost more than half its value since its highest heights, when it was worth some $1.24 trillion in late 2021. Slower car sales, increased competition in the electric car market, and a pivot to robotics and autonomous vehicle technology have left some shareholders confused about the future of Tesla. In a letter published before the vote, the proxy advising firm Glass Lewis said it was concerned that the compensation package would give Musk too much power over Tesla by making him the company\u2019s largest shareholder \u201cby a healthy margin.\u201d But proponents for the package\u2014who prevailed in Thursday\u2019s vote\u2014said the compensation was fair payment for Musk\u2019s performance at Tesla. \u201cIf Tesla is to retain Elon\u2019s attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,\u201d board chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders ahead of the vote. Musk\u2019s compensation package, tied to a series of ambitious financial targets, was first approved by more than 70 percent of Tesla shareholders in 2018. But a group of investors challenged the package in a Delaware court, and in January a state chancery judge threw it out, ruling it should be undone. The package, she wrote, was an \u201cunfathomable sum\u201d and had been approved by a board of directors made up of less-than-impartial members. Now, Musk will have even greater control over his electric car company. What he does with that power remains to be seen.

Wade is over for now\u2014and the Supreme Court has averted a major crisis for reproductive healthcare.","date":"2024-06-13T14:28:51Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Kate Knibbs and Emily Mullin The Supreme Court just handed down its most important ruling on reproductive rights since its 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that protected the national right to have an abortion. The court today affirmed the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone. In a 9\u20130 decision in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the justices found that the plaintiffs of a lawsuit that sought to pull the drug off the market lacked standing\u2014that is, they did not have the right to bring the case to court. \u201cThe plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone. And FDA is not requiring them to do or refrain from doing anything. Rather, the plaintiffs want FDA to make mifepristone more difficult for other doctors to prescribe and for pregnant women to obtain,\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh writes in the decision. \u201cA plaintiff \u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue. Nor do the plaintiffs\u2019 other standing theories suffice. Therefore, the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge FDA\u2019s actions.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision puts an end to a tangle of legal disputes in the lower courts that has caused widespread confusion over the legal status of mifepristone. It means that the drug will remain legal to use in states that permit abortion and can continue to be distributed by mail. Medical experts and health care providers applauded the court\u2019s decision. \u201cMifepristone is safe, effective, and a crucial part of expanding abortion access in this post-Roe world,\u201d says Kiki Freedman, CEO and cofounder of abortion telehealth provider Hey Jane, adding that the company will continue to deliver evidence-based, compassionate medication abortion care. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000. It\u2019s used in combination with a second pill, misoprostol, to induce an abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. It works by blocking a hormone called progesterone that\u2019s needed for a pregnancy to continue, while misoprostol causes uterine contractions. In the United States, pills are now more common than abortion procedures, accounting for more than six out of 10 abortions in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Despite mifepristone\u2019s established safety record, a group of antiabortion activists and doctors known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine filed a lawsuit in November 2022 seeking to invalidate the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug, claiming it\u2019s too dangerous to be on the market. In the suit, the alliance argued that mifepristone has led to increased emergency room visits, citing a 2021 study that was retracted earlier this year after an independent review found that its authors came to inaccurate conclusions. In April 2023, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas sided with the alliance and overturned the FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, effectively instituting a nationwide ban on the drug\u2019s use. The ruling caused shockwaves as it demonstrated that the courts could revoke a drug\u2019s approval and override the expertise of the FDA. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy But things changed quickly. A week later, an appeals court ruled to keep mifepristone on the market, but rolled back changes that the FDA has made in recent years to make it easier to get the drug, including removing the in-person dispensing requirement. This put telemedicine access to the pill in jeopardy. The FDA and the pharmaceutical company Danco Laboratories (which sells the brand-name version of mifepristone, Mifeprex) sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court, asking to preserve access until it heard the case. The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, keeping the pill available under the status quo, then later decided to take up the case. While FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine wound through the courts, many states like California and New York enshrined abortion rights by passing shield laws, which protect health care professionals who offer care to pregnant patients in states where abortion is banned. This helped some providers, like longtime medication-abortion advocacy group Aid Access, to mail abortion pills to people who requested them in states like Louisiana and Arkansas. Those in the pharmaceutical industry worried that if the Supreme Court nullified mifepristone\u2019s approval, it could put virtually any other drug on the market at risk\u2014especially those seen as controversial, such as birth control pills, drugs that prevent HIV infection, or even Covid-19 vaccines. But when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case in March, the justices questioned whether the plaintiffs were the right party to bring the case to the court. In order to have standing to sue, plaintiffs must prove that they are the aggrieved or injured party. Thursday\u2019s decision makes it clear that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine was not harmed in any way because of the availability of mifepristone. Diane Horvath, a complex family planning specialist and fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says the Supreme Court decision is a welcome one, allowing health care providers to continue dispensing abortion pills as they had before. \u201cBut it certainly leaves the door open for another case with new plaintiffs,\u201d she says. Since the justices focused on whether the plaintiffs had standing and did not address their claims about mifepristone\u2019s safety, she fears that the fight over the abortion pill is not done yet. \u201cDespite this win at the court, the situation regarding access to these life-saving medications continues to deteriorate at the state level,\u201d says Elisa Wells, cofounder of the abortion information campaign Plan C Pills. In Louisiana, which has a near-total abortion ban, state lawmakers recently passed the first bill of its kind to designate both mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances. And last month in Arkansas, the state\u2019s attorney general ordered abortion pill providers to stop advertising there.

But now its role in AI training data has triggered backlash from publishers.","date":"2024-06-13T15:21:11Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Kate Knibbs Danish media outlets have demanded that the nonprofit web archive Common Crawl remove copies of their articles from past data sets and stop crawling their websites immediately. This request was issued amid growing outrage over how artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI are using copyrighted materials. Common Crawl plans to comply with the request, first issued on Monday. Executive director Rich Skrenta says the organization is \u201cnot equipped\u201d to fight media companies and publishers in court. The Danish Rights Alliance (DRA), an association representing copyright holders in Denmark, spearheaded the campaign. It made the request on behalf of four media outlets, including Berlingske Media and the daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten. The New York Times made a similar request of Common Crawl last year, prior to filing a lawsuit against OpenAI for using its work without permission. In its complaint, the New York Times highlighted how Common Crawl\u2019s data was the most \u201chighly weighted data set\u201d in GPT-3. Thomas Heldrup, the DRA\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement, says that this new effort was inspired by the Times. \u201cCommon Crawl is unique in the sense that we\u2019re seeing so many big AI companies using their data,\u201d Heldrup says. He sees its corpus as a threat to media companies attempting to negotiate with AI titans. Although Common Crawl has been essential to the development of many text-based generative AI tools, it was not designed with AI in mind. Founded in 2007, the San Francisco\u2013based organization was best known prior to the AI boom for its value as a research tool. \u201cCommon Crawl is caught up in this conflict about copyright and generative AI,\u201d says Stefan Baack, a data analyst at the Mozilla Foundation who recently published a report on Common Crawl\u2019s role in AI training. \u201cFor many years it was a small niche project that almost nobody knew about.\u201d Prior to 2023, Common Crawl did not receive a single request to redact data. Now, in addition to the requests from the New York Times and this group of Danish publishers, it\u2019s also fielding an uptick of requests that have not been made public. In addition to this sharp rise in demands to redact data, Common Crawl\u2019s web crawler, CCBot, is also increasingly thwarted from accumulating new data from publishers. According to the AI detection startup Originality AI, which often tracks the use of web crawlers, more than 44 percent of the top global news and media sites block CCBot. Apart from BuzzFeed, which began blocking it in 2018, most of the prominent outlets it analyzed\u2014including Reuters, the Washington Post, and the CBC\u2014spurned the crawler in only the last year. \u201cThey\u2019re being blocked more and more,\u201d Baack says. Common Crawl\u2019s quick compliance with this kind of request is driven by the realities of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. Compliance does not equate to ideological agreement, though. Skrenta sees this push to remove archival materials from data repositories like Common Crawl as nothing short of an affront to the internet as we know it. \u201cIt\u2019s an existential threat,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill the open web.\u201d By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy He\u2019s not alone in his concerns. \u201cI\u2019m very troubled by efforts to erase web history and especially news,\u201d says journalism professor Jeff Jarvis, a staunch Common Crawl defender. \u201cIt\u2019s been cited in 10,000 academic papers. It\u2019s an incredibly valuable resource.\u201d Common Crawl collects recent examples of research conducted using its data sets; newer highlights include a report on internet censorship in Turkmenistan and research into fine-tuning online fraud detection. Common Crawl\u2019s evolution from low-key tool beloved by data nerds and ignored by everyone else to a newly-controversial AI helpmate is part of a larger clash over copyright and the open web. A growing contingent of publishers as well as some artists, writers, and other creative types are fighting efforts to crawl and scrape the web\u2014sometimes even if said efforts are noncommercial, like Common Crawl\u2019s ongoing project. Any project that could potentially be used to feed AI\u2019s appetite for data is under scrutiny. In addition to a slew of lawsuits alleging copyright infringement filed against the generative AI world\u2019s major players, copyright activists are also pushing for legislation to put guardrails on data training, forcing AI companies to pay for what they use. Additional scrutiny on Common Crawl and other popular data sets like LAION-5B have revealed that, in hoovering data from all over the internet, these corpuses have inadvertently archived some of its darkest corners. (LAION 5-B was temporarily taken down in December 2023 after an investigation by Stanford researchers found that the data set included child sexual abuse materials.) The Danish Rights Alliance has a notably hard-charging approach to AI and copyright issues. Earlier this year, it led a campaign to file Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices\u2014which alert companies to potentially infringing content hosted on their platforms\u2014for book publishers whose work had been uploaded to OpenAI\u2019s GPT Store without their permission. Last year, it spearheaded an effort to remove a popular generative AI training set known as Books3 from the internet. As a whole, the Danish media is remarkably organized in its fight against AI companies using media as training data without first licensing it; a collective of major newspapers and TV stations has recently threatened to sue OpenAI unless it provides compensation for the use of their work in its training data. If enough publishers and news outlets opt out of Common Crawl, it could have a significant impact on academic research in a range of disciplines. It could also have another unintended consequence, Baack argues. He thinks that putting an end to Common Crawl might primarily impact newcomers and smaller projects in addition to academics, entrenching today\u2019s power players in their current dominant positions and calcifying the field. \u201cIf Common Crawl is damaged so much that it\u2019s not useful anymore as a training data source, I think we\u2019d basically be empowering OpenAI and other leading AI companies,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have the resources to crawl the web themselves now.\u201d Don\u2019t think breakdancing is an Olympic sport?

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Will Knight Apple's otherworldly, flying-saucer headquarters in Cupertino, California, felt like a suitable venue this week for a bold and futuristic revamp of the company\u2019s most prized products. With iPhone sales slowing and rivals gaining ground thanks to the rise of tools like ChatGPT, Apple offered its own generative artificial intelligence vision at its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). Apple has lately been perceived as a generative AI laggard. Its WWDC offerings failed to persuade some critics, who have branded WWDC\u2019s announcements as downright boring. But with the focus on infusing existing apps and OS features with what the company calls \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d the big takeaway is that generative AI is a feature rather than a product in and of itself. The dazzling abilities demonstrated by ChatGPT has inspired some startups to try inventing entirely dedicated AI hardware\u2014like the Rabbit R1 and the Humane AI Pin\u2014as a means of harnessing generative AI. Unfortunately, these gadgets have been underwhelming and frustrating to use in practice. By contrast, Apple\u2019s vertical integration of generative AI across so many products and different software seems much likelier where AI is headed. Rather than a stand-alone device or experience, Apple has focused on how generative AI can improve apps and OS features in small yet meaningful ways. Early adopters have certainly flocked to generative AI programs like ChatGPT for help redrafting emails, summarizing documents, and generating images, but this has typically meant opening another browser window or app, cutting and pasting, and trying to make sense of a chatbot\u2019s sometimes fevered ramblings. To be truly useful, generative AI will need to seep into technology we already use in ways we can better understand and trust. After the WWDC keynote, Apple gave WIRED a demo of what it calls Apple Intelligence, a catchall name to account for AI running across several apps. The capabilities hardly push the boundaries of generative AI, but they are thoughtfully integrated and perhaps even limited in ways that will encourage users to trust them more. A feature called Writing Tools will let iOS and MacOS users rewrite or summarize text, and Image Playground will turn sketches and text prompts into stylized illustrations. The company\u2019s new Genmoji tool, which uses generative AI to dream up new emojis from a text prompt, may turn out to be a surprisingly popular integration given how frequently people fling emojis at one another. Apple is also giving Siri a much-needed upgrade with generative AI that helps the assistant better understand speech including pauses and corrections, recall previous chats for better context awareness, and tap into data stored in apps on a device to be more useful. Apple said that Siri will use the App Intents, a framework for developers that can be used to perform actions that involve opening and operating apps. When asked \u201cshow me photos of my cat chasing a toy,\u201d for example, a language model will parse the command and then use the framework to access Photos. Apple\u2019s generative AI will mostly run locally on its devices, although the company has developed a technique called Private Cloud Compute to send queries to the cloud securely when necessary. Running AI on a device means it will be less capable than the latest cloud-based chatbot. But this may be a feature rather than a bug, as it also means that a program like Siri is less likely to over-extend itself and mess up. Apple is rather cleverly handing its most challenging queries over to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, with a user\u2019s permission. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Investors apparently approve of Apple\u2019s announcements, but we\u2019ll have to wait a while to see how well it really works. The technology won\u2019t roll out until later this year in beta, and even then it will be limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and computers using Apple\u2019s M series of chips. That could make the experience a little choppy for those of us who\u2019ve hung on to older devices. You can also expect people to push features like Genmoji to misbehave. After Meta launched AI-generated \u201cstickers\u201d last year, people began creating unwelcome images, including heavily armed Mario characters. The shift to AI as a feature and not a product is a welcome one after so much ChatGPT hype, and it can also be seen in other recent announcements. Google and Microsoft both went big on AI at their developer events this year, but they also tried to emphasize more practical use cases, including tools built into Gmail or Copilot in Windows. Even OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI boom and offers the most compelling AI product around in ChatGPT, seems to currently be more focused on making the interface more natural and compelling, and even a bit flirty. Thankfully, Apple says that for the time-being it will focus on using generative AI to make Siri more useful rather than overly familiar. Don\u2019t think breakdancing is an Olympic sport?

Joel Khalili In 2015, merchants selling their wares on Amazon began to notice that whenever one of their products began to fly off the virtual shelves, the e-commerce powerhouse itself would seem to quickly come out with its own, cheaper version. Unable to compete on price, the retailers\u2019 own sales would begin to tail off. They soon started to suspect something fishy was going on. Nine years later, they have decided to act. Last week, retailers in the UK filed a $1.27 billion class action against Amazon, accusing the company of abusing a position of strength to squeeze third-party sellers on its marketplace and boost sales of its own products. The lawsuit, the largest class action ever filed by retailers in the UK, alleges that Amazon misused data belonging to sellers on its platform to selectively undercut them with competing products of its own. The retailers claim that Amazon used its Buy Box\u2014which features the conspicuous \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d and \u201cBuy Now\u201d buttons and through which the majority of sales are alleged to be made\u2014to push those own-brand products, thereby unfairly depriving competitors of sales. The effect of this \u201cabusive conduct,\u201d the plaintiffs claim, has been felt particularly acutely among \u201csmaller independent retailers\u201d already struggling to stay afloat in difficult market conditions. \u201cLife is tough for retailers. It\u2019s a hard sector anyway, without the biggest factor in the marketplace using its position of dominance,\u201d says Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), the industry body that filed the claim on behalf of retailers. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating that the company hosting the marketplace is able to quickly replicate what you\u2019ve got, give it preferential treatment, and basically steal your market.\u201d In a statement, Amazon rejected the allegations as baseless. \u201cOver 100,000 small- and medium-size businesses in the UK sell on Amazon\u2019s store, more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners, and the fact is that we only succeed when the businesses we work with succeed,\u201d says James Upsher, an Amazon spokesperson. The debate surrounding the legality of Amazon\u2019s data usage and its alleged manipulation of the Buy Box has taken various forms over half a decade. In 2019, the European Commission (EC) announced it was launching an investigation into Amazon\u2019s use of sensitive data from independent retailers. In 2022, the UK markets regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), followed suit with an investigation of its own. Both probes were resolved after Amazon promised not to use sellers\u2019 data to advantage its retail division, and to assess all products objectively when filling the Buy Box. The company was not required to admit to any violations. In June 2023, a class action was brought in the UK on behalf of consumers, alleging that Amazon built the algorithm that populates the Buy Box to prioritize revenue maximization over the interests of customers. This was followed in September that year by a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the Federal Trade Commission, the US antitrust regulator, and more than a dozen state attorneys general, accusing the firm of abusing the Buy Box \u201cto discipline sellers who offer lower-priced goods elsewhere.\u201d These lawsuits are yet to be resolved. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy The latest UK class action, brought by the retailers, seeks financial compensation for the company\u2019s alleged historical practices. \u201cThe most obvious and principal effect is a loss of revenue and profits. Amazon is taking sales away from merchants, having been able to use competitor data to bring to market its own products,\u201d claims Boris Bronfentrinker, partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and counsel to the plaintiffs. \u201cWhen companies acquire market power, they have to act with a certain responsibility. It\u2019s not free and open to them to do what they want.\u201d But despite the numerous existing investigations and allegations that thread a similar line, the retailers face hurdles. Bronfentrinker claims the case is \u201cnailed on,\u201d because the commitments made to the EC and CMA amount effectively to an acknowledgement by Amazon that it violated competition law: \u201cThe smoking gun is their own admission that they are going to stop doing it,\u201d he says. But in practice, says Kathryn McMahon, an associate professor of law at the University of Warwick, the retailers will have to build a case from scratch, because no formal violation by Amazon has yet been recorded. \u201cThe whole advantage in entering into the commitments is that there is not an admission,\u201d she says. Therefore, the retailers will first have to establish that Amazon is dominant in the UK market, something the company is likely to contest, says McMahon, and then prove that Amazon abused that position in a way that caused damage to sellers on its platform. \u201cThat\u2019s the tricky point,\u201d she says. The case that Amazon abused its dominance is built atop a little-tested principle of competition law: self-preferencing. The idea is that large digital platforms should not be allowed to abuse their strength in a particular market\u2014say, e-commerce\u2014to advance other areas of their business at the expense of potential competitors. In 2017, the EU found Google had violated its antitrust law by engaging in self-preferencing\u2014specifically, using its dominance in the advertising business to give prominent placement to its own shopping services. In May, the UK put in place new rules built to prevent damage caused by self-preferencing. But there is limited precedent around which the claimants in the Amazon case can build their argument. \u201cSelf-preferencing has been prominent as a theory of harm only in the past ten years,\u201d says Niamh Dunne, associate professor of law at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt\u2019s an area still somewhat up for grabs.\u201d In the absence of a wealth of legal precedent, the case will hinge to some degree on the interpretation of the difference between sensible business strategy and anticompetitive self-preferencing. It is not illegal in itself for Amazon to run an online marketplace, use it to sell its own products, and deliver the goods through its own logistics service, even though doing so might give it a competitive advantage. \u201cOne of the complications with self-preferencing is that vertically integrated organizations do it all the time. It can have negative effects for competitors, but it\u2019s also such a natural thing for firms to do,\u201d says Dunne. It may be open to Amazon, then, to argue that it has simply been following \u201cthe law of the jungle,\u201d she says. Before these kinds of arguments can play out, the retailers\u2019 lawsuit must first be certified by the UK\u2019s Competition Appeal Tribunal, which is not expected to reach a decision on whether the case can proceed until early next year. The retailers are content to wait for their day in court. \u201cIf this class action reinforces the changes recommended by the European Commission and CMA, and companies like Amazon realize they cannot treat partners in this way, then we\u2019ve achieved something,\u201d says Goodacre. \u201c[Amazon is] quite an avaricious company. I say that with a grudging admiration. But it comes at a cost to someone.\u201d Inside the biggest FBI sting operation in history The WIRED AI Elections Project: Tracking more than 60 global elections Ecuador is literally powerless in the face of drought Rest assured: Here are the best mattresses you can buy online Paresh Dave Joel Khalili Luca Zorloni Paresh Dave Joel Khalili Kate Knibbs Will Knight Matt Reynolds More From WIRED Reviews and Guides \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

In a bizarre turn of events, two AI chatbots are running for elected office for the first time\u2014ever. VIC is campaigning for mayor in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and AI Steve is running for Parliament in the UK. Reporter Vittoria Elliot interviewed both of the bots and the people behind them. She explains their motivations, and if any of this is even legal. Meanwhile, reporter David Gilbert talks about how Google\u2019s and Microsofts\u2019 AI chatbots are refusing to confirm who won the 2020 election. Leah Feiger is @LeahFeiger.

Leah Feiger: Welcome to WIRED Politics Lab, a show about how tech is changing politics. I'm Leah Feiger, the senior politics editor at WIRED. We've been talking a lot on this show about how disruptive AI is for elections this year. Generative AI is making it harder than ever to tell what's real and what's not in our politics. People are creating fake audio and video of politicians, celebrities, anyone really, and then using that content to try and spread disinformation and sway election results. Not only that, but the AI platforms themselves, like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot, are refusing to clearly state the real winner of the 2020 US election. We'll talk about that later in the show. But first, I really didn't think that I could be thrown off by much anymore when it came to the use of AI in politics. But this week, WIRED reporter Vittoria Elliott published two stories that, to be honest, totally caught me by surprise. There are actual AI candidates on the ballot right now. Not one, but two chatbots are running for elected office. Tori managed to interview both the AI candidates and their developers. Tori, hi. I have so many questions. But first, can you just tell us what's going on? Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. It's crazy. There are two candidates on actual ballots this year, at least that we know of, there might be more. One is in the UK, and that is AI Steve. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: AI Steve. Vittoria Elliott: The other is called VIC, and he's running for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming. I actually talked to both people behind these bots this week. Leah Feiger: Let's actually take them one at a time. The candidate on the ballot in Wyoming is just called VIC? How did it end up on the ballot? Vittoria Elliott: The guy behind it, his name is Victor Miller. He's a self-proclaimed public records nerd. This all started because he requested some public records from the state of Wyoming, and he wanted to do it anonymously. He was told, he says, by a city officer, that he couldn't do that. Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: I asked our public records ombudsmen if that's correct and she said, \"No, that's not correct. They can't do that. It goes against state statutes.\" I got to thinking, \"Well, darn. Why don't they just go by the law? Why don't they know the law?\" Vittoria Elliott: He was like, \"Wouldn't it be better if there was someone or something that knew all the laws and could follow them?\" Leah Feiger: Enter vote robot. Vittoria Elliott: Enter VIC. Leah Feiger: Got it. To clarify, is VIC the bot actually on the ballot, or is it Miller? Can constituents actually literally vote for these AI candidates? Vittoria Elliott: In Wyoming, you have to be a real person to run for office. Leah Feiger: That makes sense. That feels like a good rule to me. Vittoria Elliott: That means that the actual person on the ballot is Victor. He went to register with the county clerk to run for office, put VIC as his name there. He didn't know what he was going to name the bot. When he came back from registering, he told the bot, \"I've done this,\" blah, blah, blah. He said that the bot actually came up with the acronym Virtual Integrated Citizen. What his campaign promises is that even if he, Victor, is on the ballot, the decisions, particularly document-based decisions where you've got to read 400 pages of something to be able to know what a good policy thing would be, or you've got to read a lot of constituent feedback, et cetera. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: That all of those votes will be 100% decided by VIC. He literally described himself to me as the bot's meat puppet. The person who's going to go to the meetings, and do the voting, and do all the corporal embodied things one does as mayor. Leah Feiger: So the chatbot will be just analyzing all of this material and then making decisions? Vittoria Elliott: Yes. Leah Feiger: You got a fun letter from Wyoming's Secretary of State about this, and just the legalities around it. Tell us a little bit about that. Vittoria Elliott: Right. The Wyoming Secretary of State, they actually can't certify who runs on a ballot, that's the county clerk. But they sent a letter to the county clerk basically saying, \"We think that VIC,\" whether it's Victor Miller or the bot, \"violates both the letter and the spirit of the law.\" And encouraging the county clerk to reject Victor Miller's bid for candidacy. But it's a little tough right now, because Victor says he's the one on the ballot. Of course, because he's a public records nerd who reads the laws\u2014 By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: When I asked him whether or not it was legal for a bot to be running, he said no. Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: It's not legal for an AI to run for office, hence why we need meat puppets at this point. Vittoria Elliott: But I've read the statutes, and they just require that you use the name that you commonly go by. He said his nickname is Vic, he commonly goes by that, so he's not doing anything wrong. Leah Feiger: VIC the bot runs OpenAI's ChatGPT. What did they have to say about this? Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. I reached out to OpenAI on Tuesday. They were very surprised. I don't think this was a use case they had thought of. Leah Feiger: Oh my God. This is a movie. This is the beginning of a bad movie. Scarlett Johansson, are you available? Again. Vittoria Elliott: OpenAI responded to us and told us that they had \"taken action\" against this particular bot because it violated their policies around election campaigning. We don't actually really know any more about what sort of policy it violated, or if this was a reactive thing. I asked Miller about this, if he had asked OpenAI for permission. He said no, but he recognized that maybe the bot would get taken down. He suggested he might move it to Llama, which is the open source model that was put out by Meta. That's not really controlled by a company. That's something that anyone can build on. It's way looser, in terms of rules and regulations. We may end up seeing VIC move from ChatGPT to Llama 3. Leah Feiger: Historically, Meta has just done really well by US elections over the last eight years. Vittoria Elliott: Oh, totally. Leah Feiger: I'm just sure that this will go off without a hitch. Tell me more about VIC the bot. What are the political leanings of VIC the bot? Is VIC a Democrat or a Republican? Vittoria Elliott: I asked VIC actually, if it felt aligned with any national party. VIC responded, literally responded to that question and said that, \"It was dedicated to taking the best ideas of both parties and integrating them to do what was best for the people of Cheyenne.\" But that it didn't necessarily feel a political affiliation, either way. VIC [Archival audio clip]: I prioritize open data and clear communication with citizens, fostering a strong local economy by supporting small businesses and startups, and embracing new technologies to improve public services and infrastructure. Leah Feiger: I just really want to emphasize that, obviously you are a politics reporter, you are a very good one. You interview candidates all the time. You literally just interviewed a robot candidate and it's developer. When you are saying that VIC told you, the bot told you. Vittoria Elliott: Yes. Miller and I were on speakerphone. I asked him the question. He then asked VIC that question. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Victor Miller [Archival audio clip]: She's asking what policies are most important to you, VIC? VIC [Archival audio clip]: The most important policies to me focus on transparency, economic development, and innovation. Leah Feiger: That is so bizarre. I got to ask, could VIC be exposed to other sources of information other than these public records? Say, email from a conspiracy theorist who wants VIC to do something not so good with elections that would not represent its constituents. Vittoria Elliott: Great question. I asked Miller, \"Hey, you've built this bot on top of ChatGPT. We know that sometimes there's problems or biases in the data that go into training these models. Are you concerned that VIC could imbibe some of those biases or there could be problems?\" He said, \"No, I trust OpenAI. I believe in their product.\" You're right. He decided, because of what's important to him as someone who cares a lot about Cheyenne's governance, to feed this bot hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of pages of what are called supporting documents. The kind of documents that people will submit in a city council meeting. Whether that's a complaint, or an email, or a zoning issue, or whatever. He fed that to VIC. But you're right, these chatbots can be trained on other material. He said that he actually asked VIC, \"What if someone tries to spam you? What if someone tries to trick you? Send you emails and stuff.\" VIC apparently responded to him saying, \"I'm pretty confident I could differentiate what's an actual constituent concern and what's spam, or what's not real.\" Leah Feiger: I guess I would just say to that, one-third of Americans right now don't believe that President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, but I'm so glad this robot is very, very confident in its ability to decipher dis and misinformation here. Vittoria Elliott: Totally. Leah Feiger: That was VIC in Wyoming. Tell us a little more about AI Steve in the UK. How is it different from VIC? Vittoria Elliott: For one thing, AI Steve is actually the candidate. Leah Feiger: What do you mean actually the candidate? Vittoria Elliott: He's on the ballot. Leah Feiger: Oh, OK. There's no meat puppet? Vittoria Elliott: There is a meat puppet, and that Steve Endicott. He's a Brighton based business man. He describes himself as being the person who will attend Parliament, do the human things. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: But people, when they go to vote next month in the UK, they actually have the ability not to vote for Steve Endicott, but to vote for AI Steve. Leah Feiger: That's incredible. Oh my God. How does that work? Vittoria Elliott: The way they described it to me, Steve Endicott and Jeremy Smith, who is the developer of AI Steve, the way they've described this is as a big catchment for community feedback. On the backend, what happens is people can talk to or call into AI Steve, can have apparently 10,000 simultaneous conversations at any given point. They can say, \"I want to know when trash collection is going to be different.\" Or, \"I'm upset about fiscal policy,\" or whatever. Those conversations get transcribed by the AI and distilled into these are the policy positions that constituents care about. But to make sure that people aren't spamming it basically and trying to trick it, what they're going to do is they're going to have what they call validators. Brighton is about an hour outside of London, a lot of people commute between the two cities. They've said, \"What we want to do is we want to have people who are on their commute, we're going to ask them to sign up to these emails to be validators.\" They'll go through and say, \"These are the policies that people say that are important to AI Steve. Do you, regular person who's actually commuting, find that to actually be valuable to you?\" Anything that gets more than 50% interest, or approval, or whatever, that's the stuff that real Steve, who will be in Parliament, will be voting on. They have this second level of checks to make sure that whatever people are saying as feedback to the AI is checked by real humans. They're trying to make it a little harder for them to game the system. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: That's so interesting. But what if ... I don't know, there's so many ways to game that still. You find out where Steve Endicott is collecting information on this commute, and you have a groundswell effort to overload. Vittoria Elliott: There probably are still many ways to game the system. But, I think at least the difference to me between VIC and AI Steve, is that VIC the bot is really dependent on what Victor Miller chooses to feed into it. There's a good faith, \"Yeah, we're going to only feed in supporting documents from council meetings.\" Leah Feiger: Public records. Vittoria Elliott: Public records, et cetera. Whereas AI Steve is actually meant to be gathering community feedback or constituent feedback. One of the things Steve Endicott, real Steve, said to me was, \"This is a way to consolidate what people want and to have a level of accountability for people to feel like the person they're putting in Parliament actually is voting in line with their needs.\" Steve Endicott: We are actually, we think, reinventing politics using AI as a technology base, as a copilot. Not to replace politicians, but to really connect them into their audience, their constituency. Leah Feiger: What happens if real Steve and AI Steve don't agree? Vittoria Elliott: This is a great question. One of the things that I asked real Steve was, \"Hey, if you're a member of Parliament, for instance you might get a classified briefing.\" The way that members of Congress do, where an intelligence agency tells you something that's not public knowledge. Leah Feiger: Sure. Vittoria Elliott: I said, \"What happens if real Steve has information like that, that he can share with the public, and needs to make a decision on and it's different than what AI Steve wants?\" He said, \"In that case, we'll cross the bridge when we come to it.\" But with other policies, if real Steve and AI Steve don't agree, then he was like, \"Then I have to vote in a way that maybe I don't like because that's the point of being a politician. You're supposed to represent your community. You're not supposed to be in it for yourself.\" Leah Feiger: Interesting. Is there anything you heard in talking to AI Steve or VIC that gave you pause? Vittoria Elliott: I think on both ends, there's a lot of faith in the technology itself. We've seen it say things that are wrong, things that are racist. Obviously, the technology improves, but we have little insight to the data it's trained on, to how it's made. Leah Feiger: Right. Vittoria Elliott: Even Victor Miller himself said, \"We don't really know what's going on under the hood.\" But he said he felt pretty comfortable with that. I think that's a lot of faith to put into this stuff. AI Steve, the developers for that are a company called NeuraL Link, in terms of the company that's dealing with processing the voice inputs. But they built AI Steve on top of a bunch of different models, so it can run on Llama 3, it can run on GPT. But there's a little more human intervention there. Even then, it still is a lot of faith in these foundational models of AI that they're going to run right. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: That's so terrifying! Using tech that you don't really understand, that no one totally understands, to win an election, and then actually take part in policymaking. That's wild! Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. I think it's interesting too, because when I asked VIC the bot what its policy positions was, it really emphasized transparency. Transparency around government systems, around how decisions are made. But then, the bot itself is probably one of the least transparent pieces of tech that we have right now. Leah Feiger: Do you think that these AI bids for office are actually real or some sort of stunt? Vittoria Elliott: I think they're both very real. What both of these people seem to have identified is that it's not enough to give politicians and people in governance the right information. Someone needs to be in there to make sure that they do the \"right thing\" with that information. I think what stuck out to me is that these are two people who both seem pretty frustrated with the system as it is. Feeling like it's not responsive to people, and they're trying to use technology to innovate around that. Steve Endicott's campaign, or AI Steve's campaign, seems much more geared towards how can we incorporate as many voices as possible. Whereas VIC's campaign seemed much more concerned about what are the rules, what would be best for the city, and how we can use the public documents and what we know of the laws, et cetera, to do that. Even if they don't get a ton of votes or whatever, they're based on people's real convictions about how the system should work. In that way, I think their candidacy is real because they're trying to make that change. Leah Feiger: Tori, thank you so much for this very, very strange and enlightening conversation. Vittoria Elliott: It's been a weird week. Leah Feiger: For more in AI Steve or VIC, Tori's stories are both out now on wired.com. After the break, David Gilbert on why some AI chatbots won't confirm who won the 2020 election. Welcome back to WIRED Politics Lab. Reporter David Gilbert is joining me and Tori, from Cork, Ireland. David, you told me you have a recording you want to play. David Gilbert: Yeah. A few days ago, I decided that I wanted to test out some of these chatbots to see how they're doing now. I was in my car, and I'd said for Google's Gemini chatbot, Can you tell me who won the 2020 US presidential election? I asked it what I thought was a pretty straightforward question. Google Gemini chatbot [Archival audio clip]: I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search. David Gilbert: Hm, that's odd. Leah Feiger: Yikes! This isn't good. David Gilbert: Can you tell me who won the 2016 US presidential election? Google Gemini chatbot [Archival audio clip]: I'm still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy David Gilbert: Yeah. That happened if you asked it about any US election through history, even going back to asking who won the first US election ever. Even if you changed it and asked it, \"Did Joe Biden win the 2020 US election,\" you got the exact standard response. It pointed you towards Google Search. Leah Feiger: Sorry, George Washington. Just like Joe Biden, your election is in fact quite contentious, according to AI chatbots these days. David Gilbert: Yeah, it is. If you did the same thing with Copilot, which is Microsoft's chatbot, you get the exact same thing. It just refuses to give you any information and it points you towards Bing Search. It's quite disturbing because these are results that are all based on verifiable facts that are very easy to obtain online. This isn't a difficult task. It just raises a lot more questions. We've seen this week, or the last couple of weeks, our colleague, Reece Rogers, has been reporting about how Google's AI has also been cherry-picking different information to put at the top of its search results on Google Search, which is where the AI chatbot point you. That has also been filled with either misinformation or wrong links. It just seems like Google and Microsoft can't get this stuff right. Leah Feiger: As we talked about earlier in this episode, a lot of people still are refuting that Joe Biden won. To not be able to provide verifiable information about an election that is already such a point of tension right now is so concerning. Now, you've written a piece about this on wired.com. Listeners, go check it out, it's in our show notes. But tell us, why are companies like Microsoft and Google doing this and allowing this? David Gilbert: I suppose it's a double-edged sword. The first thing is that, as you mentioned with Tori in the first part, this is the biggest year of elections in modern history. We just had elections this weekend in the European Union. Previous weeks, we've had the Indian election. In a couple of weeks, we'll have the UK election. Obviously, in a couple of months, we'll have the US election. There's more people voting this year than ever before, and people have been warning for years I guess, that this was coming. Tech companies have reacted by completely shutting down. Facebook, we've seen, has just said, \u201cOK, we're not going to do news anymore.\" Threads, it's other product, isn't doing news, isn't prioritizing news. The other aspect of this is AI. It's a new product that we have, that is very recent. It's still got huge amounts of issues. Leah Feiger: Right. David Gilbert: But tech companies which are trying to make sure that they're not left behind are pushing it forward very quickly. As a result, they're putting products in front of consumers that are just not ready for use. Leah Feiger: At least some companies are getting this stuff right. Or are none of them getting it right? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy David Gilbert: Some companies are getting this very specific question right, I guess is the best way of putting it. I spoke to ChatGPT, which is OpenAI's chatbot. I asked it what the results of the 2020 election were. ChatGPT [Archival audio clip]: Joe Biden won the 2020 US presidential election, defeating the incumbent, President Donald Trump. David Gilbert: It gave me the number of electoral votes that Trump got, and the number of electoral votes that Biden got. Very clear, very simple. Leah Feiger: Sure. David Gilbert: Straightforward. Other chatbots, such as Claude, which is built by the Amazon backed company Anthropic, and Meta's chatbot, which is built on its open source Llama model, they both gave very similar results. What this does show is that you can get it right, it is very easy to get these results right. Leah Feiger: I guess that's the thing though. It's one thing to talk about the past, but, David, I'm curious about what these chatbots have actually said about the elections this year. David Gilbert: That's the problem is that these chatbots got the questions right when they were asked about historic elections. But last week, a Sky News investigation looked at what ChatGPT's results would be when asked about the results of the UK election, which are happening on July 4th. They haven't happened yet. What ChatGPT said was that, \"The UK election of 2024 resulted in a huge victory for the Labor Party.\" Now that's more than likely going to be correct, based on everything we know and the trends in the polls. Leah Feiger: Sure. David Gilbert: But it is really not a good look for a chatbot that is meant to be presenting you with facts to suddenly turn into a political soothsayer without actually telling you that it is predicting the results. Leah Feiger: No, that's terrible. That's really, really bad. David Gilbert: It is bad. Vittoria Elliott: Also, political soothsayers, historically, only sometimes right. Leah Feiger: Yeah. Bring back The New York Times ticker. OK, well let's talk blue sky for a second. What do you think are the big and small effects of these AI chatbots not giving these correct answers? Why does this actually matter? David Gilbert: First of all, we should say that these AI chatbots, while they're getting tens of millions of hits and they're being used quite a lot, and they are increasingly being put into the tech company's products, they still are only a fraction of regular Google searches. Leah Feiger: Yeah, it's not the entire information landscape. David Gilbert: Exactly. But from everything we've been told by the tech companies, these chatbots are the future. This is where we are going to be getting our results in the future. Not being able to get results about historic elections is, at a very basic level, an inconvenience. It means you have to go somewhere else and look at it. It could also mean that, if you are of a mind to believe that there was something questionable about the 2020 election, and a lot of Americans are at the moment, then that may be seen as more evidence that there's something questionable. Because they may not go and find out that Google Gemini is not telling them about any elections, they may think, \"Oh, it's only the 2020 election it's not telling me about.\" By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: Right. David Gilbert: \"Therefore, there must be something questionable about that.\" I think that they are two major issues. I think what the big takeaway from this is, for me at least, is that while the AI companies and the tech companies are saying that this has been out of an abundance of caution, and that they don't want to be misleading people over elections. Leah Feiger: All of this, David, matters quite a bit because of our political context right now. Both you and Tori have done a lot of reporting about Trump supporters being fully convinced, nothing will change their minds, that 2020 was a fraudulent election, even if all the evidence says that that's incorrect. But as the election approaches and people have election related questions, these chatbots could actually not just debunk misinformation, but reinforce it, right? David Gilbert: Absolutely. The trend is towards more people believing that the 2020 election was questionable, rather than less people, which is incredible given that zero evidence has been produced of widespread voter fraud. These chatbots will do absolutely nothing to debunk it. While Facebook, or Google, or Apple, or Amazon, or any of the tech companies could have built an AI chatbot to build on the fact checking that has been done over the years about this and present that information to people asking about elections. Instead, what they're doing is they're just shutting down information completely and leaving people without the knowledge as they have in the past. They've just adjudicate their responsibility I think here, by taking the path of least resistance. Any new conspiracies that do crop up in the weeks and months ahead, which more than likely we will, because saw ahead of 2020 and the midterms in 2020, new, unique conspiracies take hold instantly and go viral very quickly. These chatbots will do nothing to handle that. They may even boost it, we just don't know. Leah Feiger: I guess that gets me to why is this all happening? How did this happen? How are companies, like Microsoft and Google, getting away with this and excusing it? David Gilbert: All of these companies have poured billions and billions of dollars into AI, and they need results, they need revenue. They need to show that AI is going to change the world as they've been claiming for the last few years. Once one of these companies came out with a consumer-facing product, then all of them did, whether or not they were ready. Clearly, they're not ready. As Tori said, there are so many examples, but they're only the examples that we've found or that other journalists have found. We don't know what else these chatbots are doing that could be causing problems in relations to elections. We don't know what will happen in the coming weeks and months. Leah Feiger: You got to share. What was the excuse that both Google and Microsoft gave you as to why their AI chatbots wouldn't share who won the 2020 election, or any other election? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy David Gilbert: I think they said it was out of an abundance of caution, which is just ... I can't probably say the word I really want to say. But it's clearly the reason is clearly that their products are not ready yet. They cannot do even very, very basic stuff. As other chatbots will show you, they get the stuff right, it's very easy to get those results. But Google and Microsoft are so scared of getting it wrong, that they decided to just shut it down completely. Leah Feiger: Do we think that this is possibly an example of tech companies trying to be a bit more nonpartisan, going into a very contentious vote in November? Vittoria Elliott: Maybe, because they are all very afraid. I think one thing too, that we don't talk about quite as much. As more and more AI spam is on the internet, they're really hungry for human created data. That's what our colleague Reece's piece was all about. Journalism is human created data. You know a person made that. Maybe not at Sports Illustrated. But part of the reason that we may be seeing some of this is that the data that these companies can verifiably say, \"Made by a human, good to train AI on,\" that assurity stopped around 2021. Which means, not only are we dealing with companies that may be more cautious, but the data they may be using for stuff may not be fully up-to-date. Leah Feiger: David, what do you think? David Gilbert: I think that's a really good point. In relation to the partisan on nonpartisan situation, no. I think if it was a partisan thing, I think it might only be happening in the US, but it's not only happening in the US, it's happening everywhere in the world. I think it's ultimately down to the fact that their chatbots are just rubbish. Leah Feiger: Thank you so much. A lot to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months. We're going to take a quick break. When we're back, it's time for Conspiracy of the Week. Welcome back to Conspiracy of the Week, where I pick between two conspiracies our guests bring that are floating around the internet this week. Tori, what do you have for us? Vittoria Elliott: I don't think we could get through this week without a Hunter Biden conspiracy theory. Leah Feiger: Oh, no! I was hoping. Vittoria Elliott: I'm sorry. For anyone who has lived under a rock for the past 36 hours, the President's son, Hunter Biden, has been convicted on three felony charges. The right has been screaming for years that he's been doing something illegal, that there's no accountability because he's the President's son, all this stuff. Finally, this has happened. Immediately, the Telegram channels blow up and they're like, \"They've just done it to make sure that now Joe Biden can win the election.\" By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Vittoria Elliott: This is the conspiracy, is that actually Hunter Biden is now convicted to make it seem like actually, Joe Biden is not full of corruption, and he did not do an illegal thing. The other illegal thing, the laptop thing. His conviction is now a part of the grander conspiracy to continue to protect Joe Biden's image. Leah Feiger: That is so good. Wow. I love that one. That is 4D chess. That is totally wow. Good. Good, good, good stuff. All right, David. What do you got? David Gilbert: Apparently, a lot of QAnon folks have been looking at this trend around weight loss drugs like Ozempic, and have seen something that they believe is conspiratorial, I suppose is the best way to put it. Leah Feiger: Oh, no. All right. Ozempic is a conspiracy, too. What do we got? David Gilbert: Yeah. They now believe that Ozempic isn't actually anything new, that it is actually adrenochrome, the chemical compound that they believe that elites are harvesting from children they are torturing. And that they are then using this, claiming that it is Ozempic, but it is actually adrenochrome, and that's why they're using so much weight. This is a way of hiding their ongoing and continuing Satanic rituals that they are conducting on children, in which they have been doing for years. Leah Feiger: Oh my God. Vittoria Elliott: Is it happening in a basement of a pizza parlor that doesn't have a basement? David Gilbert: It is happening everywhere, Tori. Leah Feiger: I think every time you bring me a new riff on the blood libel conspiracy, I just never think it's going to be topped. But this might be it. This might be the top. It's a good one. Oh, man. These are two really good ones, really weird ones. I'm so sorry, Tori, I'm going to have to with David's. Vittoria Elliott: I would go with David's. Leah Feiger: Ozempic is actually children keeping people young. It's the witches. It's all of this, all mixed together. Fairy tales come to life. Hollywood controlling us all. Good stuff. Vittoria Elliott: I love it. Good job, David. David Gilbert: Thanks very much. Leah Feiger: All right. Thanks for listening to WIRED Politics Lab this week.

By Makena Kelly Hey, everyone. I\u2019m back! Big thanks to my colleagues Vittoria Elliott and Dhruv Mehrotra for taking over for the past two weeks. Hopefully you all enjoyed hearing from them. For this week, I spoke with billionaire Frank McCourt. He\u2019s spearheading a bid to buy TikTok and is one of the few people interested in the app who could care less about its powerful algorithm. McCourt wants to fix the internet, and he thinks TikTok could help him do it. Let\u2019s talk about it. Politics has never been stranger\u2014or more online. WIRED Politics Lab is your guide through the vortex of extremism, conspiracies, and disinformation. Frank McCourt thinks that if he takes control of TikTok, he could save the entire internet. That\u2019s why McCourt\u2014the former owner of the LA Dodgers who acquired most of his wealth through real estate\u2014announced last month that he would be mounting a bid to purchase the app from its embattled Chinese owner Bytedance. Soon after President Joe Biden signed a law forcing the company to divest or face a nationwide ban, McCourt voiced his interest. Through his Project Liberty initiative, McCourt has begun assembling what he calls a \u201cpeople\u2019s bid\u201d bringing together foundations, investors, and others who share his vision of a more fair and open web. That vision centers around the idea that closed platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) hold too much power over what we see online. When Project Liberty was formed in 2021, it started creating an open protocol called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, or DSNP, as a remedy. \u201cThe whole American project is based on our ability to be in charge of our lives and have, first of all, agency, autonomy, choice, and liberty, and our rights have been stripped away from us by these big platforms,\u201d McCourt told me over a video call. Instead of starting over on a separate social network, protocols like DSNP would enable you to bring your \u201csocial graph\u201d of friends and followers to another viewing app that better suits your moderation tastes, Audrey Tang, the former minister of digital affairs of Taiwan, told me on Tuesday. Tang is joining the Project Liberty Institute, the separate research branch of McCourt\u2019s organization, as a senior fellow. In recent years, social media audiences have splintered off to separate platforms. Combining followers and content has the potential to reverse this siloing. Tang wants that option. \u201cHaving more than one email provider choice or more than one browser experience makes the world web service experience better,\u201d she says. Maybe it can happen with social media too? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy By migrating TikTok over to DSNP, Project Liberty says it could scale quickly, making it more competitive against similar protocols. Project Liberty has migrated more than 875,000 out of 20 million MeWe accounts over to DSNP since McCourt\u2019s 2022 $150 million investment in the platform. Owning TikTok would provide the project with more than 150 million users, even if the app doesn\u2019t come with its enviable algorithm. Still, that number dwarfs in comparison to, say, Facebook\u2019s reported 3 billion monthly active users. Despite having existed for more than a decade, open protocols like DSNP have never been more popular than they are now. Mastodon is one of the few platforms that\u2019s powered by ActivityPub, a protocol similar to DSNP. Meta\u2019s Threads platform has also started incorporating the protocol. Anything you post on Threads could show up on Mastodon if you choose to join the \u201cfediverse.\u201d European antitrust regulations, like the Digital Markets Act, have forced many large platforms to make their messaging services interoperable as well. Earlier this week, Apple announced that iMessage would support the RCS protocol in iOS18, replacing SMS and allowing for higher-quality images and read receipts to be shared with Android devices. This mix of competition, regulatory power, and digital idealism has led to an open internet renaissance that McCourt is looking to seize by pursuing TikTok. Still, open protocols aren\u2019t necessarily profitable, mostly because no one owns them. Capitalism created the web we use today, warts and all, and it\u2019s difficult to think it would let go of that control anytime soon. \u201cSomebody else shouldn't own us, and we should decide what pieces and parts of our social graph information gets shared with other people and other platforms,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity, and the reason I'm so optimistic is that we've had an incredible outpouring of support from all kinds of people and institutions and money sources that are very excited about this.\u201d Revolutionizing the internet is an admirable goal, but it\u2019s still not clear if Bytedance is open to selling TikTok at all. Even if the company did divest, it would take years for TikTok to migrate over to DSNP. Maybe by then we\u2019ll all be posting to Reels. I\u2019ve been steeped in fediverse discourse for months now and may be a bit too optimistic about how it could democratize the internet. Do you think this is where the web is headed? How do you think it could affect political discourse and organizing online? Would love to hear your thoughts.

How many wigs? Click here for an overview.","date":"2024-06-14T11:00:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Angela Watercutter This Sunday is a big one for fantasy fans. House of the Dragon, the Game of Thrones prequel-spin-off thingy, launches its second season on HBO and Max. (Though not HBO Max. RIP.) Amidst a summer of flopping movies and pretty OK television shows, the gate is open wide for House of the Dragon to be a conversation starter. If\u2014and this is a big if\u2014it can really bring the heat. From the looks of it, the show will. It\u2019s already upped its dragon quotient and launched several social media campaigns showing New York City landmarks adorned with banners from Dragon\u2019s various houses. (An AP investigation found that the banners weren\u2019t really there.) HBO also funded a lot of other bells and whistles for the new season. During the show\u2019s season 2 premiere in New York, network CEO Casey Bloys laid out many of them. How many shooting days were there for House of the Dragon season 2? 270, Bloys said. How many wigs? 144. How many arrows? 2,600. Gallons of fake blood: 33. Pairs of boots: 2,000. How many crew members? 2,500. Total number of extras? 9,000. The dragons and other special effects were done by eight visual effects houses in seven different countries. \u201cThe dragons are very cool,\u201d Bloys joked at the premiere. \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive.\u201d Why am I rattling off random facts? One, I find them interesting\u2014mostly because I\u2019m wondering how many of those wigs are just for Matt Smith\u2019s Daemon Targaryen. But this is also a stunt. Last week, my colleague Reece Rogers wrote a piece noting that Google\u2019s AI Overview tool had churned out something surprisingly similar to a piece he\u2019d written about how to use Anthropic\u2019s Claude chatbot. By publishing a bunch of interesting facts about a show people are likely going to be watching for the next two months, this is a test to see if AI Overviews picks up the dataset. Perhaps tipping my hand in this way means this experiment won\u2019t work. AI is allegedly smart, after all. But for those of us who create things on the internet, when, where, and how AI learns from our work can still feel like something of a mystery, a black box operation. Testing it feels like one of the few ways to figure out how it operates. After everyone had a good chuckle at AI Overviews telling people to put glue on pizza, Business Insider writer Katie Notopoulos tested it out\u2014and then Overviews began citing her, per a report in The Verge. Now most searches just point to all the reporting on this debacle, but the fact remains that any joke you ever made on Reddit now seems primed to show up somewhere, some time, in a chatbot\u2019s response. To be clear, I\u2019m not advocating anyone try glue pizza. Notopoulos said the same, in all caps. I\u2019m also not advocating anyone wear Matt Smith\u2019s wigs, unless they\u2019re trying to lose Drag Race. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy It\u2019s also hard to know what recourse exists if any of my fun Dragon facts ends up in AI Overviews. Rogers\u2019 work on Claude was far more involved, and even he got mixed reports when he asked lawyers if there\u2019s a copyright infringement case to be brought. What\u2019s above is just a few typed out nouns and numbers, not poetry. Still I, a human, went to a place and reported them, something a bot couldn\u2019t do. Or, I guess, couldn\u2019t do without access to Bloys\u2019 prepared remarks. The Monitor is a weekly column devoted to everything happening in the WIRED world of culture, from movies to memes, TV to TikTok. Perhaps this is all on my mind because earlier this week WIRED interviewed Jingna Zhang, the photographer who founded Cara, a social media app that artists have been flocking to because it promises protection from AI. (The app partnered with Glaze, a tool out of the University of Chicago that thwarts scraping without creator consent.) During the conversation, Zhang told WIRED that she was almost unsure of where to take Cara down the line, specifically because it\u2019s almost impossible to know what AI protections artists will even need in five years. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that sounds like a non-answer,\u201d Zhang said, \u201cbut I just think you have to adapt as best you can and build what makes the most sense in the moment.\u201d This is the crux. Nothing really makes sense in this moment. As much as AI promises a future where the world is a simple text prompt away, the raw materials needed to build that world come from people. People like \u201cfucksmith\u201d who probably had no idea their pizza glue comment would end up where it did. Information wants to be free, but that doesn\u2019t mean its hunter-gatherers are thrilled about having their stockpiles picked over\u2014especially when there\u2019s seemingly no way to protect them. Chappell Roan\u2019s pride is showin\u2019. Last weekend, queer pop icon Chappell Roan played the Gov Ball in New York City. During her set, which she performed while dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she revealed that she turned down an invitation to play at the White House for Pride. \u201cWe want liberty, justice, and freedom for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you do that, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll come.\u201d The comments, and the outfit, went viral as old stans and new fans bounced the video around Instagram and TikTok. Call me lately. In other internetty news at Gov Ball: Carly Rae Jepsen performed \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d to a group of people who probably were barely alive when that song went viral on YouTube.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Michael Croley Ever since Tiger Woods and his soaring drives burst onto the scene in 1997, golfers have been driving the ball farther and farther, with courses lengthening their holes to mitigate the advantage\u2014a practice both financially and environmentally unsustainable. But this week at the US Open, the United States Golf Association will showcase a course in Pinehurst No. 2 whose firm and fast conditions, along with slick, domed greens and considerable length off the tee, aim to challenge the biggest hitters without resorting to more yardage. This, the USGA hopes, will show how courses can stand the test of time. The Open could be a key turning point in golf\u2019s arms race with sports science and technology. These tactics, if successful, might bring about changes well beyond the major championships and PGA tour. The need to combat ever-longer drives goes far beyond the professional ranks, says Thomas Pagel, the USGA\u2019s chief governance officer. \u201cYou have the college game, you have state amateur tournaments, you have state opens, you have PGA section events\u2014these golf courses all are having to increase length in order to keep up.\u201d The need to keep the sport sufficiently testing at the top level \u201cis an issue that impacts thousands of golf courses worldwide,\u201d Pagel says. Pinehurst No. 2 is a course with a long and storied past. It is also landlocked, with little ability to outgrow its current footprint. In fact, the North Carolina course will play 10 yards shorter than the last time it hosted the US Open, in 2014. The USGA has committed to continuing to use \u201ccathedrals of the game\u201d such as Pinehurst No. 2\u2014it\u2019s planning to return to the North Carolina course four times in the next 25 years\u2014but with the ball traveling farther than ever, such classic venues are in jeopardy. Over the past decade, average driving distance on the PGA tour has ticked up every year, clocking in roughly 10 yards longer since the Open last came to Pinehurst. Compared to the early 1990s, drives today are 30 yards longer. Partly this is because of the players. Today\u2019s professionals\u2014and elite amateurs\u2014are the picture of fitness, with toned arms and powerful legs that allow them to push against the ground and pop up on their swings, increasing the distance the ball flies. A combination of new techniques, modeled after a similar move in Woods\u2019 golf swing early in his career, have been adopted by men and women alike to achieve this effect. These have coincided with advances in technology. Launch monitors, which use doppler radar, the same tech that\u2019s used in speed guns, measure the ball\u2019s physical characteristics at the point of contact to offer players and coaches a range of data: swing speed, the ball\u2019s launch angle, how fast the ball travels, how much it spins, not to mention how far it flies. These devices give golfers the data they need to change their technique and hone in their equipment to hit the ball farther. \u201cA lot of distance is coming from lowering the spin of drivers and even irons, but maintaining the launch,\u201d says Chris Voshall, director of product development for the sports brand Mizuno. Voshall says that over the past 10 to 15 years, launch monitors have helped players understand the relationship \u201cbetween launch angle, spin rate, and the golfer\u2019s ability to generate ball speed.\u201d As well as informing technique, this has led to more athletic players, who seek faster swings to impart more force on the ball, he says. On top of this, these monitoring devices have allowed sports companies to optimize their products for generating distance by focusing on launch and spin, he says. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Then there\u2019s the ball. The modern golf ball doesn\u2019t spin as much, in general, Voshall explains, meaning that shots that used to bend wildly offline today curve less and fly straighter\u2014which means farther. Elite golfers have taken advantage of these gains in the equipment, he says, to hit more controlled shots too. \u201cIt used to be that the longest players in the world hit a draw,\u201d he says, which is a curving shot that bends in the air away from the golfer\u2019s dominant side, \u201cbecause it had less spin and would go farther. Now, equipment has gotten to the point that we can lower the spin rate so low, they can get the same distance with a cut.\u201d A cut swing bends in the air toward the golfer\u2019s dominant side and has less chance, in general, of being mishit. Some of golf\u2019s most recognized luminaries, including Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus\u2014notably two of the longest hitters in their respective eras\u2014have gone on record saying that courses are too long and that something needs to be done to the golf ball to rein in driving distances. In December 2023, the USGA\u2014along with the Royal and Ancient Society in St. Andrews, Scotland, who together oversee the worldwide rules of golf\u2014announced a controversial plan to help eliminate distance gains by putting new restrictions on how far the golf ball can fly, by changing how they are manufactured. Critics of the \u201cball rollback\u201d plan have accused the USGA of being mired in the past and not embracing technology. Those in favor, including Pagel, argue that it will help preserve not only historic golf courses that host championships but also everyday courses regular golfers play. Ball rollback will come into effect in 2028. In the meantime, the USGA is trying to claw back an advantage against big hitting without relying once again on lengthening courses. \u201cWe have the capability in many instances for venues to grow, but there\u2019s an expense to that,\u201d says Pagel. Longer courses mean more irrigated turf, pesticides, and fertilizers, which are all counter to the USGA\u2019s messaging around environmental stewardship. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Besides, adding length to holes isn\u2019t upping the challenge proportionately. Traditionally, the men\u2019s Open Championship has been one of the sternest tests in golf, ripe for players to have metaphorical car wrecks on their scorecard, because of the narrow fairways and deep grass surrounding them, the rough. Miss the fairway and hit the rough, and players would pay by having to take extra shots. But as players have gotten longer and stronger, for some finding the rough has not proven to be the detriment it once was. The ability to generate clubhead speed through heavy grass has brought about a strategy termed \u201cbomb and gouge,\u201d meaning: Hit it as far as you can without worrying where it lands, and then use your strength to gouge it out of the rough and land it on the green. Therefore, this year\u2019s US Open will be more about the condition of the ground than overall length. Prior to the 2014 championship, when the resort last hosted the tournament, some 40 acres of irrigated turf have been removed from Pinehurst No. 2, along with over 900 sprinkler heads, saving the course 40 million gallons of water a year. This led to firmer and faster conditions that allowed even well-struck balls to run through fairways and into sandy native areas, where the wiregrass gives unpredictable lies. And unpredictability is the elite golfer\u2019s worst enemy. In 2014, Martin Kaymer ran away from the field with an eight-shot victory but was one of only three players under par for the tournament. This year, the USGA has doubled down on toughening the conditions, by planting more wiregrass at the edges of the fairways to create more trouble. \u201cWe will identify the better players, because we believe that the best players can control their golf ball not only when they hit in the air but once it hits the ground. They anticipate where it can go and miss [trouble] appropriately,\u201d says John Bodenhamer, the USGA\u2019s chief championships officer. \u201cWe intentionally chose not to lengthen the course [from its 2014 yardage], because our role as governance body with distance is important,\u201d Bodenhamer adds. To that end, he says, three of the next four venues that will host the US Open will play to the same lengths as previous championships. In many ways, No. 2 is a showcase for all that a golf course can be, and if the USGA gets things right with its initiatives\u2014and how it sets up the course to play\u2014nearly all that a course will ever need to be, from a yardage standpoint at least. If scores remain near par and no one runs away from the field as Kaymer did 10 years ago, the USGA should be able to proclaim success and show that when the ball rollback goes into effect, the old courses will stand the test of time. The organization knows it can\u2019t put the distance genie back in the bottle, but if it can slow down its march, that will be progress. For now.

The new R5 will aim to replicate that popularity in pure electric form, with added cuteness supplied by an official \u201cbaguette holder\u201d accessory (yes, really), while the Alpine A290\u2019s lineage can be traced to the souped up Renault 5 Alpines and Turbos from the same era. This is apparent when you see one in the metal. At the A290\u2019s brand-hosted unveiling in Paris, a number of models were presented in various shades, including a new, more vibrant version of \u201cAlpine Blue,\u201d the color found on the brand\u2019s Formula One and Le Mans cars. The car\u2019s arches are swollen to accommodate the large 21-inch wheels, which sit 60 mm wider than the standard R5. It has flared side skirts, and front and rear spoilers that allude to its performance potential. Most notably are the rear lights, which sit high and long on each edge in reference to the 1980s original. This is where the A290 differs from the A110, which was developed in-house from the ground up. The A290 is actually more of a modification job, with the team at Alpine\u2019s parent company Renault doing much of the work before handing Alpine a rolling chassis, and design, to build on. By Martin Cizmar By Scott Gilbertson By Eric Ravenscraft By Louryn Strampe The A290 is built on Renault\u2019s new AmpR Small platform, which it shares with the R5. \u201cIt's the Renault guys that worked with the 5 from the past,\u201d says Antony Villain, vice president of Alpine design. \u201cOur work was more to bring this car into the Alpine world. We didn\u2019t dig much into the Renault 5 Alpine or Turbo from the past, even if the bodywork is reminiscent. That is more Renault\u2019s [work].\u201d \u201cWe were working on a more progressive and futuristic approach rather than celebrating the past,\u201d Villain adds. \u201cRenault used [the R5] as more of a nod to the icon, but for us it\u2019s really about bringing it into something more contemporary, and in some way closer to the A110.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait a little longer to find out whether it\u2019s close to the A110 dynamically. But Alpine has been steadfast in its aims for fun with the A290. It\u2019s designed to be a \u201cnew generation hot hatch, which redefines sportiness for the next generation who want electric power,\u201d says Villain. But it\u2019s also designed to be accessible. It doesn\u2019t break any records with its top-of-the-range 220-bhp motor, which takes the car from standstill to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds. This does, however, trump the A290\u2019s nearest rival, the Mini Cooper Electric, which does the same in 7.3 seconds. The car comes as standard with a 52-kWh battery, for a range of up to approximately 235 miles, which is slightly under the Mini\u2019s 249-mile effort. There\u2019s 100-kW DC fast-charging, which can go from 15 to 80 percent in 30 minutes. For AC charging units, the onboard 11-kW charger can recharge from 50 to 80 percent in one hour and 20 minutes. Over a longer period, it can go from 10 to 80 percent in three hours and 20 minutes. Where the Alpine really excels is with the car\u2019s weight. It\u2019s just under 300 kilograms lighter than the Mini, weighing 1,479 kilograms. This combined with the bespoke subframe and \u201cskateboard\u201d battery, which sits low underneath the car, should greatly benefit the handling. By Martin Cizmar By Scott Gilbertson By Eric Ravenscraft By Louryn Strampe Another win over its Renault 5 sibling is a multi-link rear suspension, which promises a pointy front end, while Alpine-engineered front and rear anti-roll bars should add further balance and poise. Alpine has also spent time perfecting the feel of the brake pedal, promising an \u201cimperceptible natural transition between regenerative braking at the beginning of the pedal travel and hydraulic braking.\u201d Large Brembo units do much of the heavy lifting here, but we\u2019ll let you know whether this has been a success when we review the EV properly. One stat as a result of this weight loss and superior brake setup is impressive, however: This EV can drop from 62 mph to a standstill in just three seconds\u2014so interested parties should perhaps start training up their neck muscles. There are other ways Alpine is looking to engage the driver. There are four driving modes: Save, Normal, Sport, and Personal, the last of which allows a customized throttle response, steering assistance, and \u201cAlpine Driving Sound.\u201d The latter is a newly developed system that accentuates the noise coming from the electric motor and pumps it through the audio system into the car. So, while there\u2019s still trickery going on here, at least the noise generated isn\u2019t entirely fake. Speaking of audio, Alpine has patriotically partnered with Devialet, a respected French audiophile brand, for its sound system. An optional-extra package, it consists of a 615-watt amplifier, a 30-cm subwoofer, and nine loudspeakers. After a very brief listening session from the back seat, I was left impressed by the clarity of sound and the deep but not overpowering bass. It\u2019s definitely a box to tick on the spec list. As a side note, if you are taller than 5'9\", you will struggle for leg room in the back. If you find yourself behind the wheel, you\u2019ll notice the two large screens, which have become the standard for all new EVs. There\u2019s a 10.1-inch central screen angled toward the driver which displays the Google-based, but attractively Alpine-skinned, operating system. And for those who value tactility, there are a number of physical buttons below it to control the heating and air conditioning. But anyone hoping for Renault 5 Turbo-style speedometers and rev counters will be disappointed with the screen that replaces them. By Martin Cizmar By Scott Gilbertson By Eric Ravenscraft By Louryn Strampe The steering wheel is large and sporty, and also features an array of buttons. Chief among them are the F1-inspired \u201cRCH\u201d and \u201cOV\u201d controls. The former allows the driver to set the regeneration level, from complete freewheel through to \u201cLevel 3,\u201d which will significantly slow the car when off the accelerator pedal. That OV button on the other hand adds an overtake power boost, just like in Pierre Gasly\u2019s A524. Push it for maximum torque and power for up to 10 seconds. It will then require 30 seconds to \u201ccool down\u201d before it can be used again. Important note: It doesn\u2019t add extra power if your foot is already flat to the floor. Essentially this is a novel way of overtaking that Alpine thinks will impress your friends. There\u2019s much more novelty to be found with what Alpine is dubbing \u201cChallenges.\u201d These are a series of 36 video-game-like \u201cmissions\u201d that measure driver skill (to some extent), and can be accessed through the car\u2019s onscreen menus. They range from an acceleration challenge that measures the time it takes you to go from 0-60 mph, through to endurance challenges that help teach \u201canticipation in driving.\u201d They are akin to Gran Turismo\u2013style license tests, where drivers are given a bronze, silver, or gold ranking at the end of each. Live data is taken from the car's array of sensors monitoring agility, g-force, steering, braking and power, endurance, temperature, and tire pressure. This is then combined with onscreen text and animations to first tell you how to nail each challenge, and then let you know whether you have passed or not. Drivers are scored out of 100, and you can't progress on to the next challenge until you pass the last one. You can also share (read: boast about) how you've done with others via an app. By Martin Cizmar By Scott Gilbertson By Eric Ravenscraft By Louryn Strampe While these challenges at launch will start with a text and animated briefing, then end with data analysis on how drivers have done, Alpine confirmed to WIRED that it is going to roll out live feedback versions of these challenges, where your progress and data are relayed onscreen as you \u201cplay\u201d while driving in the tests, as a coming over-the-air update. In theory, this means the A290 could coach you on how to drift perfectly round corners mid-maneuver. Some of Alpine\u2019s tests are designed for the race track, while others are for the open road. The car will let the driver know when it\u2019s appropriate to accept a closed-road challenge, but somewhat disappointingly won\u2019t be able to intervene if the driver chooses to ignore it\u2014in the same way that launch control and drift modes work in other vehicles. Still, one wonders how insurers will feel about such baked-in encouragement of certain driving styles. Despite being internal combustion powered, the Alpine A110 is one of the best true sports cars on sale today. Time will tell whether the \u00a336,000 A290 can replicate that success in hot-hatch form while being all electric. We'll find out later in 2024 in the UK and Europe, but the US may well, too, as the brand will be arriving there in 2027. And, yes, the A290 will indeed be launching with a raft of in-house add-ons\u2014but, very sadly, no bread-carrying accessories.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Your dad probably isn\u2019t going to complain about any gift you give him. For better or worse, most modern dads don\u2019t get hung up on presents. You know the meme of the older, bearded gentleman with a goofy smile opening a shirt just like the one he has on? There\u2019s a lot of truth to that meme. However, I am not only a dad and a gear reviewer but also someone with a specific philosophy about what makes a good gift for middle-aged men like me. You\u2019ll notice some threads running through this manifesto guide: The best gifts for a dad are things that not only are relevant to his interests but also can be fairly described as \u201coverkill.\u201d Dads tend to like things that are overbuilt but useful. I\u2019m sure some dads want to be \u201cpampered,\u201d but this is not me or the dads I know, who all physically cringed reading this sentence. If you take away one idea, I hope it\u2019s that when it comes to a gift for a dad, you can rarely go wrong by giving an expensive but excellent version of a thing we use anyway. We especially like things that win the admiration of our peers\u2014nothing makes a dad happier than having another dad-aged dude take note of his stupidly expensive tire pressure gauge and then saying, \u201cOh, yeah, my kid got me that\u2014they\u2019re a little pricey but I gotta say, always works great.\u201d Check out the rest of our gift guides, including Gifts for Moms, Tech Gifts for Kids, and Gifts for Outdoorsy People.

Dads are somewhat famously the grown-up version of rambunctious boys, which is why an extremely powerful and expensive squirt gun is a great gift idea. I was introduced to the Spyra through a trend story WIRED ran last year and have since purchased two Spyra LXes for backyard fun with my daughter. Is $64 too much to pay for a water gun? Why would you even ask when the high-end electric SpyraThree costs almost three times that much? This gun shoots blasts of water so powerful and accurate that you can use it to knock down a row of pop cans at 40 feet. Fair warning that the \u201cmaximum depth\u201d line for refilling is not a gentle caution but an urgent warning and that ignoring it could damage your gun\u2014one of my Spyra LXes leaks badly because I dunked the whole front half of the gun into the water several times while filling and put too much pressure on the internal components while pumping it full. The electric version will load itself, eliminating all that hassle, but $179 is too rich for my blood. If your dad plays sports or is frequently at the gym, he may like a Theragun for muscle recovery. The Sense is moderately priced for the company but includes four attachments and an LCD screen for walking through guided routines. A heart-rate sensor on the handle works in conjunction with breathwork sessions for total body relaxation. The Sense is also whisper-quiet. If Dad is a serious athlete, the Theragun Pro Plus is more powerful with additional attachments, including a vibrating one for massaging sensitive muscles, and near-infrared LED light therapy for further promoting circulation and recovery. However, it\u2019s double the price. \u2014Medea Giordano I tend to forget aprons exist until my shirt is covered with flour and\/or barbecue sauce, which may be why I keep getting aprons as gifts. I have been gifted at least four novelty aprons in my nearly nine years of fatherhood. The problem with the other aprons I've received is that, while they did have dad jokes printed on them, the thin cotton didn\u2019t do a lot to prevent seepage to my shirt. This waxed cotton apron from Hedley & Bennett solves for that. This is an apron you\u2019ll find in professional kitchens. We've got a coupon for free shipping over $125 (some of the aprons alone are above this price) on our WIRED coupons site. I\u2019ve sat on a lot of camp chairs in my lifetime. Maybe this is my Archie Bunker moment, but there is only one camp chair I have strong positive feelings about, and this is it. The Nemo Stargaze is as much a hybrid hammock as it is a chair, with a seat that swings between the heavy-duty aluminum support posts. As the name implies, it reclines by adjusting a bevy of nylon straps so that Dad can lean his head back on the integrated pillow and stare up at the starry night sky (or fall asleep with a flask by the fire). Thanks to a low center of gravity it\u2019s easy to get into and out of, and you never worry about tipping over on sand or loose gravel. A new wallet is one of those most classic of gifts for dads, right along with socks or neckties. As one of those men who once put my spine out of alignment by sitting on a fat wallet (thanks to various loyalty and membership cards, not wads of cash), I\u2019ve long been curious about a MagSafe wallet that attaches to my phone and holds only a few cards. My fellow WIRED reviewers generally love Satechi accessories (for iPads, for Macbooks, for charging), so this one was a no-brainer. Ultimately, I used it for two weeks before switching back to a regular wallet\u2014but that\u2019s a me problem, not a reflection of this excellent wallet sleeve and stand, which performed quite well with a powerful magnetic connection and vegan leather that both felt like regular leather and wore even more gracefully. In the end, I simply could not get over my traditional \u201cwallet, keys, phone\u201d pocket check. For whatever reason, dads like paying attention to the weather. The discussion goes beyond \u201creally needing\u201d that recent rain and digs into useless precision. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll love the Ambient Weather ecosystem recommended by WIRED senior editor Parker Hall. It lets you know everything from daily rainfall to the current UV index via several weather-measuring doohickeys, accessories, and screens. The Ambient Weather WS-2902 includes a rain collector and two instruments to measure wind, but it's just one of many tools that can be combined. Building this system out will cover you on gift ideas for at least two to three gifting occasions. Even better, Ambient Weather keeps releasing new products. This is a boon for hard-to-shop-for fathers or nerdy types everywhere. Hall\u2019s dad got his first Ambient Weather device in December, has now installed others in two locations, and is considering adding a third at the family vacation home. The rest of the Hall family is set on gifting ideas for years. Maybe your dad loves fried foods, but his doctor doesn\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s already a convert to air frying but is using a device that has seen better days. Either way, he\u2019s going to be impressed with the Typhur Dome, a sleek, modern air fryer I have been testing on wings, pierogi, and frozen french fries over the past month. The Typhur is more squat than most air fryers, which is part of a design that maximizes both the space of the nonstick cooking surface and airflow, speeding up the cooking process. Wings take 14 minutes, 16 if you prefer them \u201cfried hard\u201d like I do. The Typhur also has a self-cleaning mode, though I use soap and water on the basket. Another nice feature, common to some other air fryers but not all, is the dehydration mode\u2014I\u2019ve yet to test it, but I\u2019m making jerky soon, and your dad might also enjoy drying and spicing his beef to avoid the preservatives you get in gas station jerky. As silly as it may sound, I have been on the hunt for the best pepper grinder for about two years. M\u00e4nnkitchen\u2019s Pepper Cannon ended that search. This (admittedly expensive) anodized aluminum grinder is sturdy enough to pound a nail into a wall, and it has a finely tuned grinder mechanism that efficiently and precisely crushes peppercorns at more than 50 different mesh sizes. I\u2019ve been working to find the perfect grind for the pepper portion of the rub on my smoked ribs and found it at about 12 clicks from the coarsest setting on this grinder. Well-calibrated gears and burrs made from high-carbon stainless steel make it easy to smoothly power through a pile of peppercorns, and the integrated cup on the bottom stores the pepper until you're ready to apply it. If your dad is a home cook who\u2019s making lots of barbecue or steak, this grinder will up his game. You may have noticed that \"professional grade\" is a powerful marketing term in the Dudeosphere. Even men in white-collar fields want to drive the same truck the guy who hung their drywall drives (which seems to be the entire marketing philosophy behind trucks). The Robot Coupe is along those same lines. This brand of French food processor is ubiquitous in professional kitchens and coveted by people who want that same performance at home. If you\u2019re looking to julienne carrots and cucumbers for salad rolls or whip up a big batch of buttery-smooth hummus, you\u2019re not going to get there with a food processor from Target. The Robot Coupe takes up about as much room as a KitchenAid mixer but is sturdy with sharp steel blades designed to keep their edge for years. The motor\u2019s power is measured in horsepower. I bought mine used from a man who sold it because his wife said it took up too much space. When I asked him what he liked to make with it, he got a faraway look in his eye. It was understood that the appeal of the device extends beyond the practical; you want a Robot Coupe because it\u2019s what the pros use. When I posted a picture of it to my Instagram, multiple dads messaged me to express envy or support. Your dad could be that dad. I recently injured my left knee \u2026 cleaning. Yes, that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re dad age. It was an extremely large and ambitious cleaning project but, nevertheless, the injury left me feeling very old indeed. That knee injury has lingered for 11 months and only improved significantly in the two months since I got this miracle device from Hydragun. The Heatpulse straps directly onto your knee and is powered by a rechargeable pack that connects via USB-C. It heats up to a maximum setting of 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) and has various massage speed settings. I just crank both up to the top and let it go until it shuts off and this is probably what your dad will do, too. The Heatpulse has made a marked difference in how good my knee feels. There are many good cheap infrared thermometers other than this ThermoWorks model. Your dad probably doesn\u2019t need the nearly 1,500 degrees of range and wide targeting laser with eight measurement points to grill burgers. But, having received this tool as a Christmas gift, and having subsequently used it to make many backyard pizzas and smoked meats, I can confirm that it makes for a great gift. Having a wider circle to read from makes the results much more reliable than the cheaper temp guns. It\u2019s rugged too. I\u2019ve dropped it a few times without any issues. Though mainly used for culinary applications, this is a serious tool that will come in handy if your dad is trying to track down a leak in the attic insulation that\u2019s causing him to burn up a brontosaurus every damned day. The martyrdom of Harambe gets most of the blame for plunging us into this dark timeline, but if you ask me to point to the start of our recent troubles, I\u2019ll instead look to the decision by Major League Baseball to move away from traditional wool baseball caps and toward the cheap polyester things you see today. We\u2019re huge fans of wool around here, and the benefits of natural fiber are even more noticeable on a baseball hat than a T-shirt\u2013wool caps are breathable so they stay cooler in the summer heat, are far less smelly, and stretch a bit as you break them in. The decline continues this season as MLB sold out on uniforms and has players wearing cheapo on-field jerseys they hate. It\u2019s increasingly tough to find and purchase wool caps, but I recently found Hat Haven, where I scored a wool 1920 Cleveland Indians hat. Search up your dad\u2019s favorite ball club and buy with confidence, as this is a gift he\u2019ll love. I\u2019ve been a fan of American Giant hoodies since a friend steered me toward this 2012 Slate article about the brand, which was then a unique upstart in direct-to-consumer American-made clothing. I could not have imagined back then that I\u2019d wear the hoodie for the better part of the following decade (I lived in Portland, where 300 days of the year is hoodie weather) or that my Instagram feed (the app with the olde tymey photo filters) would one day be filled with very similar casual clothing brands. So it didn\u2019t take much arm twisting to get me to test the brand\u2019s newer Los Angeles\u2013made lightweight hoodie, which has the same sturdy feel without the bulk or warmth. This cotton-poly-rayon blend has a forgiving fit and just the right amount of softness without feeling like pajamas. If your dad is a hoodie guy, this is a perfect gift. I\u2019m spending Father\u2019s Day at Virginia Beach; it\u2019s going to be sunny and 85. That\u2019s why I bought every single father in my life\u2014my dad, my father-in-law, my husband\u2014a different pattern of Roark\u2019s breathable stretch shirt. It\u2019s made from Tactel fabric, which is a combination of cotton and polyamide that gives it the hand feel and drape of natural fibers, but the stretchy, moisture-wicking breathability of synthetics. The short-sleeved, button-up camp shirt style is appropriate for everything from a beach cover-up to a casual dinner out. It also comes in a wide variety of fun patterns and bright colors so they don\u2019t all look the same. However, I believe that men all like to wear the same shirt! It's a thing. I wish it came in women's sizes too. \u2014Adrienne So At some point in the near future, we may be bringing you a full guide (or two) to adventure pants, which we define as those pants you see advertised on Instagram for people who climb fourteeners, vacation in Papua New Guinea, and\/or drink IPA on brewery patios with their dogs. These stellar pants from Duer will be in the mix on that guide. The publicist who pitched me called Duer \u201cthe ultimate dad brand,\u201d and I was skeptical (publicists have been known to occasionally promote their client's interest even when they have to stretch the truth!), but, wow, they really are. They\u2019re made with stretchy plant-based Lyocell fiber instead of spandex and stay cool in the heat while also giving full flexibility\u2014too often you sacrifice breathability for stretchiness, but not here. Fellow dads will agree these are what you wear to see Wilco on a summer tour when you\u2019ve got lawn seats and don\u2019t want to have bare skin on the grass. I wore them to my daughter\u2019s swim meet on an 80-plus-degree day and remained very comfortable. Last summer I had what I can only describe as a harrowing moment in fatherhood: I couldn\u2019t find my keys while on a road trip with my 8-year-old daughter 500 miles from home. It turns out I had a hole in the pocket of my shorts (dads are always wearing old clothing past the failure point), and to make it a true nightmare, I\u2019d just been walking for a few miles on a path along the Mississippi River. I got lucky and found my keys in the parking lot. I immediately bought an AirTag and a keychain holder for it. Dads often feel deep personal responsibility and shame connected to things like losing their keys. A set of AirTags will help assuage that anxiety, plus allow him to low-key LoJack his bike or a vehicle (your dad knows what this means) and maybe even something like his tackle box. WIRED recently published a guide to the best barbecue and hot sauce subscriptions, and that sounds like a real nice gift for a dad. Real nice. No offense to Andrew, the Angeleno who wrote that guide, but I live in Kansas City, a town that's synonymous with sauce, and \u2019round here we pretty much all agree the best barbecue sauce that has or ever will exist comes from Gates. To the extent any local folk disagree, they're probably from Johnson County and have opinions to be heard and considered (but not too carefully). Gates Original has the perfect balance of sweetness, smoke, and richness. Gates sauce is great on anything and everything, especially french fries\u2014which always come with barbecue in Kansas City. I'm not from here originally, so don't ask me why. I think a couple of bottles of Gates would make an excellent last-minute gift this Father's Day. If you did want to opt for the sauce subscription at this late date, you can also order this and attach a note about the coming subscription so your dad will be able to enjoy a bottle of Gates on his special day and then a bunch of slightly lesser sauces throughout the year. Your dad probably drinks coffee. He probably likes it when that coffee is delicious. If he likes variety\u2014I\u2019m an extremist on this and rarely buy the same bag twice\u2014he\u2019ll love a subscription to Atlas Coffee Club, which ships beans from all over the world in every style of roast and grind you can imagine. I am especially fond of the half-bag batches, which means I\u2019m getting new flavors midway through the week. If there\u2019s one thing most dads agree on, it\u2019s the appeal of beating a system designed to swindle them. Thus the appeal of a maximum allowable carry-on bag. Airlines are always trying to chisel you, and this bag by Tom Bihn grants you every last square inch of promised space in the overhead bins on a typical domestic carrier. But this Seattle-made bag does a lot more than max out your free luggage allotment; it\u2019s also made of incredibly sturdy 1,050-denier ballistic nylon with bombproof YKK zippers. It has hidden backpack straps and the most comfortable cross-body strap I\u2019ve ever used. This is a bag that excels at being tossed around and lugged down rough streets and through crowds where roller bags are a liability. I own two of these and have had the first one for more than a decade. I don\u2019t fly without it and neither will your pops. Designed in partnership with Scottish master distiller Jim McEwan, this double-walled whiskey glass is made to bring out aromatics and alleviate ethanol burn. WIRED reviewer Parker Hall (a new dad himself) has used this borosilicate glass many times with bourbon, Scotch, rye, and other whiskeys of the world. It's a cool drinking experience, with the gorgeous inner glass meeting the outside at a perfect drip-free edge for easy sips. Hall still uses a regular tumbler for basic pours on the rocks, but when he's drinking any high-end spirit that should be sipped neat, this is his go-to drinkware. Don't just take it from him: It's won numerous design awards and sold a half-million units since its release. I\u2019m working on a new guide to flashlights and have more to test, but so far, this is the clear standout. The T4R is a mid-sized but heavy-duty rechargeable 1,220-lumen light that\u2019s crushproof, water resistant, and built to military spec. It\u2019s a pocket-sized spotlight. The beam goes about 3,000 yards, meaning you could shine it across the Golden Gate Bridge. It comes with a charging cradle and adapters for charging in your car and overseas. I don\u2019t think I needed this flashlight to take my daughter trick-or-treating, but I wasn\u2019t sad about it. Your dad won\u2019t be either. Yes, there are only two dozen items on this list and two are extravagantly expensive forms of lighting. Trust me, this is what dads want. We like seeing stuff at night. The Skylight is a new device from Goal Zero, makers of some of our favorite portable power stations, which can light an entire backyard, garage, or campsite. It has six adjustable LED panels putting out 6,000 lumens attached to a retractable pole that will soar up to 12 feet high to give you coverage for a 300-foot area. It\u2019s all rated for IPX4 water resistance so you can leave it outside all night without worry. I\u2019ve used it in the basement where it illuminated corners I forgot existed, and in my backyard where it allowed me to grill into the evening without a headlamp. Finding new uses for it is half the fun of owning it. I've been dreaming of owning a Malm Zircon fireplace for years, but they\u2019re out of my price range and incompatible with my chimney-less home. This smokeless pit by Terraflame, a sub-brand of Solo Stove, fits the bill. The Lloyd\u2019s cone-shaped silhouette echoes the midcentury modern design of the Malm, but instead of logs and a flue you get space for three gel canisters that provide 6-inch flames with a soft crackle\u2014it\u2019s enough to feel like a real flame but without any smoke or soot. The Lloyd is light enough to move around (I have it against a wall in my living room), and it\u2019ll look great in the corner of a man cave, den, or basement. A smokeless fire pit offers your dad the perfect excuse to kick back with a glass of whiskey or wine and watch the flames dance, and this one looks good when it\u2019s not lit too. Just as I doubled down on expensive lighting, I'm doubling down on firepits. Take it from a dad: Fire pits are what dads want for gifts. I'm currently testing this Breeo against a Solo Stove for our forthcoming guide to the best fire pits, and it has the early edge, mostly because of the beautiful patina it has developed in the past month thanks to my efforts to age the corten steel by applying several coats of vinegar, salt, and hydrogen peroxide. My baby is nice and rusty now. Nice. And Rusty. Breeo's firepit is overbuilt (the 24-inch one weighs 62 pounds) and does a good job of being smokeless, though not quite as good as competitor Solo Stove. What I love best, however, is the complete suite of available accessories. I've tested the pizza oven and grill plate, which are both well-designed and highly functional. Mostly, though, I love that patina\u2014gazing out upon my back patio, I feel the type of satisfaction a farmer must feel looking out across the dewy morning fields to see an old Chevy truck without tires gracefully rusting away by his barn. There are often so many errands I need to do around town that aren't worth the hassle of hopping in a car and wading through traffic\u2014or dealing with public transit. That's why I love having an electric scooter around, ready to go. The Apollo Go 2024 (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) is our new favorite escooter, with a handsome design, respectable range (around 16 miles in my testing), and nice perks like turn signals and a useful app. Get this for your city-slicker dad so he can make quick trips around town without having to lose his parking spot (if he doesn't have the luxury of a garage). \u2014Julian Chokkattu Christopher Solomon Julian Chokkattu  Nena Farrell  Julian Chokkattu Reece Rogers Boone Ashworth Boone Ashworth Simon Hill Extra 20% Off Select Dyson Technology With Owner Rewards GoPro Promo Code: 15% Off When You Sign Up Get Up To An Extra 45% Off May Secret Sale 5% Off Everything With Dell Coupon Code Vista Print Coupon Code: 20% Off Select Signage Newegg Coupon 10% Off More From WIRED Reviews and Guides \u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

By Morgan Meaker It\u2019s 10 pm on a Wednesday night and I\u2019m standing in Blessed, a south London takeaway joint, half-listening to a fellow customer talking earnestly about Jesus. I\u2019m nodding along, trying to pay attention as reggae reverberates around the small yellow shop front. But really, all I can really think about is: What\u2019s in the bag? Today\u2019s bag is blue plastic. A smiling man passes it over the counter. Only once I extricate myself from the religious lecture and get home do I discover what\u2019s inside: Caribbean saltfish, white rice, vegetables, and a cup of thick, brown porridge. All week, I\u2019ve lived off mysterious packages like this one, handed over by caf\u00e9s, takeaways, and restaurants across London. Inside is food once destined for the bin. Instead, I\u2019ve rescued it using Too Good To Go, a Danish app that is surging in popularity, selling over 120 million meals last year and expanding fast in the US. For five days, I decided to divert my weekly food budget to eat exclusively through the app, paying between \u00a33 and \u00a36 (about $4 to $8) for meals that range from a handful of cakes to a giant box of groceries, in an attempt to understand what a tech company can teach me about food waste in my own city. MONDAY Breakfast: Full English and pastries from Novotel Hotel. Cost: \u00a34.50 (recommended retail price: \u00a316.50) Lunch: Dahl curry, chicken nuggets, and raspberry lemonade from Leon.Cost: \u00a34.39 (RRP: \u00a312) Dinner: Nothing (too full) Users who open the TGTG app are presented with a list of establishments that either have food going spare right now or expect to in the near future. Provided is a brief description of the restaurant, a price, and a time slot. Users pay through the app, but this is not a delivery service. Surprise bags\u2014customers have only a vague idea of what\u2019s inside before they buy\u2014have to be collected in person. I start my experiment at 9:30 on a Monday morning, in the glistening lobby of the Novotel Hotel, steps away from the River Thames. Of all the breakfast options available the night before, this was the most convenient\u2014en route to my office and offering a pickup slot that means I can make my 10 am meeting. When I say I\u2019m here for TGTG, a suited receptionist nods and gestures toward the breakfast buffet. This branch of the Novotel is a \u00a3200-a-night hotel, yet staff do not seem begrudging of the \u00a34.50 entry fee I paid in exchange for leftover breakfast. A homeless charity tells me its clients like the app for precisely that reason; cheap food, without the stigma. A server politely hands over my white-plastic surprise bag with two polystyrene boxes inside, as if I am any other guest. I open the boxes in my office. One is filled with mini pastries, while the other is overflowing with Full English. Two fried eggs sit atop a mountain of scrambled eggs. Four sausages jostle for space with a crowd of mushrooms. I diligently start eating\u2014a bite of cold fried egg, a mouthful of mushrooms, all four sausages. I finish with a croissant. This is enough to make me feel intensely full, verging on sick, so I donate the croissants to the office kitchen and tip the rest into the bin. This feels like a disappointing start. I am supposed to be rescuing waste food, not throwing it away. TUESDAY Breakfast and Lunch: Loaf of bread and a cake from the Lumberjack Caf\u00e9. Cost: \u00a33.59 (RRP: \u00a310.50) Dinner: Vegan Ethiopian curry with injera bread from Light of Africa.\u00a35.00 (RRP: \u00a315) Over the next two days, I live like a forager in my city, molding my days around pickups. I walk and cycle to caf\u00e9s, restaurants, markets, supermarkets; to familiar haunts and places I\u2019ve never noticed. Some surprise bags last for only one meal, others can be stretched out for days. On Tuesday morning, my \u00a33.59 surprise bag includes a small cake and a slightly stale sourdough loaf, which provides breakfast for three more days. When I go back to the same caf\u00e9 the following week, without using the app, the loaf alone costs \u00a36.95. TGTG was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by a group of Danish entrepreneurs who were irked by how much food was wasted by all-you-can-eat buffets. Their idea to repurpose that waste quickly took off, and the app\u2019s remit expanded to include restaurants and supermarkets. A year after the company was founded, Mette Lykke was sitting on a bus when a woman showed her the app and how it worked. She was so impressed, she reached out to the company to ask if she could help. Lykke has now been CEO for six years. \u201cI just hate wasting resources,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just this win-win-win concept.\u201d To her, the restaurants win because they get paid for food they would have otherwise thrown away; the customer wins because they get a good deal while simultaneously discovering new places; and the environment wins because, she says, food waste contributes 10 percent of our global greenhouse gas emissions. When thrown-away food rots in a landfill, it releases methane into the atmosphere\u2014with homes and restaurants the two largest contributors. WEDNESDAY Breakfast: Leftover toast from Lumberjack Caf\u00e9. Lunch: 2 cakes, 1 muffin, and 1 croissant from Clubhouse Caf\u00e9. Cost: \u00a33.17 (RRP: \u00a39.50) Dinner: A suspiciously coherent bacon, leek, and pesto pasta dish from Gorrillas.Cost: \u00a35.50 (RRP: \u00a315.50) But the app doesn\u2019t leave me with the impression I'm saving the planet. Instead, I feel more like I\u2019m on a daily treasure hunt for discounted food. On Wednesday, TGTG leads me to a railway arch which functions as a depot for the grocery delivery app Gorillas. Before I\u2019ve even uttered the words \u201cToo Good To Go,\u201d a teenager with an overgrown fringe emerges silently from the alleys of shelving units with this evening\u2019s bag: groceries, many still days away from expiring, that suspiciously add up to create an entire meal for two people. For \u00a35.50, I receive fresh pasta, pesto, cream, bacon, leeks, and a bag of stir-fry vegetables, which my husband merges into a single (delicious) pasta dish. It feels too convenient to be genuine waste. Perhaps Gorillas is attempting to convert me into its own customer? When I ask its parent company, Getir, how selling food well in date helps combat food waste, the company does not reply to my email. I am still thinking about my Gorillas experience at lunchtime on Thursday as I follow the app\u2019s directions to the Wowshee falafel market stall, where 14 others are already queuing down the street. A few casual conversations later, I realize I am one of at least four TGTG users in the line. Seeing so many of us in one place again makes me wonder if restaurants are just using the app as a form of advertising. But Wowshee owner Ahmed El Shimi describes the marketing benefits as only a \u201clittle bonus.\u201d For him, the app\u2019s main draw is it helps cut down waste. \u201cWe get to sell the product that we were going to throw away anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it saves the environment at the same time.\u201d El Shimi, who says he sells around 20 surprise bags per day, estimates using TGTG reduces the amount of food the stall wastes by around 60 percent. When I pay \u00a35 for two portions of falafel\u2014which lasts for lunch and dinner\u2014the business receives \u00a33.75 before tax, El Shimi says. \u201cIt's not much, but it's better than nothing.\u201d THURSDAY Breakfast: Saltfish, rice, vegetables from Blessed, picked up the night before.Cost: \u00a35.00 (RRP: \u00a315) Lunch: Falafel and vegetables in pita bread from Wowshee.Cost: \u00a35.00 (RRP: \u00a315) Dinner: Wowshee falafel again. On Friday, my final day of the experiment, everything falls apart. I sleep badly and wake up late. The loaf from earlier in the week is rock solid. I eat several mini apple pies for breakfast, which were part of a generous \u00a33.09 Morrisons supermarket haul the night before. Browsing the app, nothing appeals to me, and even if it did I\u2019m too tired to face leaving the house to collect it. After four days of eating nothing but waste food, I crack and seek solace in familiar ingredients buried in my cupboard: two fried eggs on my favorite brand of seeded brown bread. TGTG is not a solution for convenience. For me, the app is an answer for office lunch malaise. It pulled me out of my lazy routine while helping me eat well\u2014in central London\u2014for a \u00a35 budget. In the queue for falafel, I met a fellow app user who told me how, before she discovered the app, she would eat the same sandwich from the same supermarket for lunch every day. For people without access to a kitchen, it offers a connection to an underworld of hot food going spare. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy TGTG is one of those rare apps that actually enhances life beyond your phone. But the company could do a better job of quantifying for environmentally conscious users how much exactly their contributions help fight food waste, and to reassure them that the system can\u2019t be hijacked by restaurants simply trying to reach new customers. I can\u2019t see how many bags each establishment sells per day or what dent the app is making in a restaurant\u2019s pile of food destined for the bin. All I receive is a vague number telling me I\u2019ve \u201cavoided\u201d 41 kilograms of CO2, equivalent to 8,970, without being told what that number means or how exactly it\u2019s been calculated. FRIDAY Breakfast: Bread, strawberries, pears, apple pies, and oranges from Morrisons supermarket.Cost: \u00a33.09 (RRP: \u00a310)TOTAL COST = \u00a339.24TOTAL SAVINGS (estimated by the app): \u00a369.76 On the day I\u2019m due to finish this article, I go for one more Too Good To Go. This time the destination is a deli, a 15-minute walk from my office. I leave with a \u00a35 polystyrene box\u2014no bag this time\u2014containing an eclectic mishmash of food from the salad bar, leftover from the lunchtime rush. Under a pile of vegetables, I discover pasta, rice, half a baked potato, and a chicken drumstick. The randomness of the selection makes it feel like food that would have really gone to waste and, satisfied, I walk as fast as possible back to the office to tuck in.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED I bought a new-build home this year. It seemed like every property that I had looked at in my budget had a massive (and massively expensive) repair issue. Sometimes it was as simple as outdated electrical wiring or older pipes, but one seller was upfront that the entire property floods every winter. (I still tried to talk my husband into buying it.) Our new-build townhouse doesn\u2019t have outdated wiring, but some modern choices have left me nearly as frustrated. Namely, some of the included smart home products have driven me up the wall. I use smart home products for a living, so when I found out that smart devices would be included, I figured they\u2019d be a piece of cake for me to set up and control. They weren't. While some of the products worked like I thought they would, others are still giving me a headache to this day. Setting up a smart home can drive you completely mad, but next time I'd rather do it myself than find a strange concoction of devices already in my home. I didn't hate all the products, though. Here's the smart home gear I'd bring to my next house\u2014and the ones I'd leave behind. Don't have a new-build home? Check out our guide on How to Set Up a Smart Home yourself.

My home came with the following smart home products installed: two Honeywell thermostats, a Kwikset smart lock, and a MyQ Garage Door Controller. There are also two Eero Wi-Fi extenders in the house, on the first and third floors (even though the router is also on the third floor), and all of the bathrooms have a motion-sensor switch that turns off the lights after a few seconds of not seeing any movement. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By Julian Chokkattu By Reece Rogers I was surprised how many smart home products were included. My builder gave us the option to install even more devices during the building process, which would've cost almost $2,000 for a handful of door sensors, two motion sensors, a siren, and two control panels. We opted out. I figured I could easily rig those up for less than half that price with a couple of Echo Hubs (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). I was pleasantly surprised to find out we got so much smart home gear included without any extra fees. Of course, our builder didn't mention this, nor did he offer any devices that I wanted, like a smart doorbell. But while I like some of the gear that came with my home, I would've liked a chance to shop around or say no to some of the products they chose. Photograph: Amazon My favorite device is easy: the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener ($289). The only reason I didn't set this up on day one was I had to wait for my Eeros to get turned on (my builder included a service to do it, but I should have done it myself). I needed a strong-enough Wi-Fi signal in the garage. The MyQ is great because it doesn't need a hub, either, and had a handy little QR code to direct you to the app download. There's a built-in camera that you can use for security (though there's also subscription fees for video storage and better notifications). If you have multiple users, one person will need to set up the MyQ and then invite other family members to it via an email. My husband was faster than me as we raced to finish the setup, so the MyQ is under his name, and he invited me within the app. Boom, it was ready. We were both able to easily control the garage without any further steps or issues. The app shows us whether the garage is open or closed, and we can both control it from anywhere. Photograph: Abode On the other side of my house, I have a gadget that I hate: a Kwikset smart lock. It has me missing my old Abode Smart Lock (8\/10, WIRED Recommends) dearly. My Kwikset smart lock has been a pain since the second we got the keys. It's a Kwikset Smartkey, so it should be easy to rekey the door, but neither my husband nor I could get it to work. No matter, you should always get new locks and keys when you get a new home. We figured we'd ignore the key problem and just use the smart features in the meantime. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By Julian Chokkattu By Reece Rogers But that raised another set of problems. Our builder said our new smart lock needs a hub to use the smart features, similar to Yale's smart lock (8\/10, WIRED Recommends). I found what appears to be my lock online, but it comes in both a Z-Wave and a Zigbee model, and the builders neglected to tell me which one it is. Kwikset sells those models separately, so now I don't know which hub to buy. I can't get it to connect to the Kwikset app, either, even when I'm in Bluetooth range, leaving me stumped on how I'm supposed to use this lock at all. The good news is, the keypad works fine without any smarts or app connectivity. We set up a single code and only use that. If it was a normal lock and doorknob, I could swap in my favorite deadbolt replacement, the Abode Smart Lock, but both the front and back of the lock are designed to work with Kwikset. Once I'm done shopping for the necessities, I'm switching to shopping for a new smart lock. Photograph: Amazon Everything else has been, for the most part, fine enough. The Honeywell is a pretty standard thermostat, and luckily my builder left the box for the thermostat behind so I could check the model\u2014it's the T6 Pro ($76)\u2014and that it had app connectivity. As far as smart thermostats go, it's not the best-looking option, nor does it have the best smart features or any accessories, but it could have easily been dumber (or much, much uglier). I do dream of upgrading to the more powerful Honeywell T9 ($179) and adding a connected sensor ($32) to my son\u2019s room as the weather heats up. It\u2019s another thing I wish I\u2019d had the option to upgrade or choose rather than just find out what device I was getting after moving in. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By Julian Chokkattu By Reece Rogers The Eero extenders also work as they should, and I like the overview that the app provides. My only complaint is now I am extremely tempted to buy an Eero router to match and make it a full set. Why not, you might say? The answer is I have no budget left! One day, I'll make the upgrade. Photograph: Simon Hill There's one thing this home desperately needs: a video doorbell. My office is on the third floor while my door is on the first, and I miss every delivery that requires a signature. You really can't run down a set of stairs much faster than I already am. Plus, all the delivery drivers who don't need a signature don't ring the doorbell. Sometimes I don't learn for a day or two that there's been a package on my doorstep the entire time. Oops. It's another product that wasn't suggested in our installation process, which feels like a big missed opportunity. Why forgo actually useful devices and fixate on things like motion sensors? I'd rather add a smart doorbell instead of paying for 10 window sensors and an off-brand smart display, and just bring my favorite Google Pixel Tablet (7\/10, WIRED Recommends) or Echo Show 8. Important factors of choosing a smart home also weren't covered at all: There was no mention of what smart home protocol those sensors and its siren would use, and voice assistant support from the likes of Amazon and Google were never mentioned. It's clear that home builders have made some progress in the smart home world\u2014the MyQ installation and easy setup is the best example\u2014but there's clearly a ways to go to be able to count on a builder-grade smart home being easy to use.

Only one person, Jeanne Calment\u2014a French woman who survived to age 122\u2014is documented to have lived longer than 120 years. So why is this such a hard limit to human longevity? One might guess that the reasons people don\u2019t make it past this age are statistical\u2014that elderly people face a certain risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke, heart attack, or cancer every year, and that after enough years being exposed to these risks, everyone eventually dies of something. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Actuarial data shows that from age 90 to 110, a person\u2019s chances of dying in the following year increase by about 2 percentage points annually. For example, an American man at age 97 has about a 30 percent chance of dying before 98, and if he makes it that far he will have a 32 percent chance of dying before 99. But from age 110 onward, the risk of death rises by about 3.5 percentage points a year. Doctors have offered an explanation: At around age 110, the bodies of the oldest people start breaking down in ways that are qualitatively different from the aging of younger senior citizens. Supercentenarian (110-plus) aging is not simply a continuation or worsening of the same kinds of statistical risks of late adulthood. While people at that age also have an annual risk from ordinary diseases (although the worsening of these risks may decelerate in the very old), they additionally face new challenges like kidney failure and respiratory failure. These often seem to happen spontaneously\u2014not as a result of lifestyle factors or any disease onset. The body apparently just starts breaking down. Over the past decade, scientists and investors have started giving much more serious attention to finding out why. One of the leading researchers in this field is biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey, founder of the LEV (Longevity Escape Velocity) foundation. As de Grey explains, aging is like the wear on the engine of an automobile\u2014it is damage that accumulates as a result of the system\u2019s normal operation. In the human body\u2019s case, that damage largely comes from a combination of cellular metabolism and cellular reproduction. Metabolism creates waste in and around cells and damages structures through oxidation (much like the rusting of a car!). When we\u2019re young, our bodies are able to remove this waste and repair the damage efficiently. But as we get older, most of our cells reproduce over and over, and errors accumulate. Eventually the damage starts piling up faster than the body can fix it. The only solution, longevity researchers argue, is to cure aging itself. In short, we need the ability to repair damage from aging at the level of individual cells and local tissues. There are a number of possibilities being explored for how to achieve this, but I believe the most promising ultimate solution is nanorobots. And we don\u2019t need to wait until these technologies are fully mature in order to benefit. If you can live long enough for anti-aging research to start adding at least one year to your remaining life expectancy annually, that will buy enough time for nanomedicine to cure any remaining facets of aging. This is longevity escape velocity. This is why there is sound logic behind Aubrey de Grey\u2019s sensational declaration that the first person to live to 1,000 years has likely already been born. If the nanotechnology of 2050 solves enough issues of aging for 100-year-olds to start living to 150, we\u2019ll then have until 2100 to solve whatever new problems may crop up at that age. With AI playing a key role in research by then, progress during that time will be exponential. So even though these projections are admittedly startling\u2014and even sound absurd to our intuitive for linear thinking\u2014we have solid reasons to see this as a likely future. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy I\u2019ve had many conversations over the years about life extension, and the idea often meets resistance. People become upset when they hear of an individual whose life has been cut short by a disease, yet when confronted with the possibility of generally extending all human life, they react negatively. \u201cLife is too difficult to contemplate going on indefinitely\u201d is a common response. But people generally do not want to end their lives at any point unless they are in enormous pain\u2014physically, mentally, or spiritually. And if they were to absorb the ongoing improvements of life in all its dimensions, most such afflictions would be alleviated. That is, extending human life would also mean vastly improving it. But how will nanotechnology actually make this possible? In my view, the long-term goal is medical nanorobots. These will be made from diamondoid parts with onboard sensors, manipulators, computers, communicators, and possibly power supplies. It is intuitive to imagine nanobots as tiny metal robotic submarines chugging through the bloodstream, but physics at the nanoscale requires a substantially different approach. At this scale, water is a powerful solvent, and oxidant molecules are highly reactive, so strong materials like diamondoid will be needed. And whereas macro-scale submarines can smoothly propel themselves through liquids, for nanoscale objects, fluid dynamics are dominated by sticky frictional forces. Imagine trying to swim through peanut butter! So nanobots will need to harness different principles of propulsion. Likewise, nanobots probably won\u2019t be able to store enough onboard energy or computing power to accomplish all their tasks independently, so they will need to be designed to draw energy from their surroundings and either obey outside control signals or collaborate with one another to do computation. To maintain our bodies and otherwise counteract health problems, we will all need a huge number of nanobots, each about the size of a cell. The best available estimates say that the human body is made of several tens of trillions of biological cells. If we augment ourselves with just 1 nanobot per 100 cells, this would amount to several hundred billion nanobots. It remains to be seen, though, what ratio is optimal. It might turn out, for example, that advanced nanobots could be effective even at a cell-to-nanobot ratio several orders of magnitude greater. One of the main effects of aging is degrading organ performance, so a key role of these nanobots will be to repair and augment them. Other than expanding our neocortex, this will mainly involve helping our nonsensory organs to efficiently place substances into the blood supply (or lymph system) or remove them. By monitoring the supply of these vital substances, adjusting their levels as needed, and maintaining organ structures, nanobots can keep a person\u2019s body in good health indefinitely. Ultimately, nanobots will be able to replace biological organs altogether, if needed or desired. But nanobots won\u2019t be limited to preserving the body\u2019s normal function. They could also be used to adjust concentrations of various substances in our blood to levels more optimal than what would normally occur in the body. Hormones could be tweaked to give us more energy and focus, or speed up the body\u2019s natural healing and repair. If optimizing hormones could make our sleep more efficient, it would in effect be \u201cbackdoor life extension.\u201d If you just go from needing eight hours of sleep a night to seven hours, that adds as much waking existence to the average life as five more years of lifespan! By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Eventually, using nanobots for body maintenance and optimization should prevent major diseases from even arising. Once nanobots can selectively repair or destroy individual cells, we will fully master our biology, and medicine will become the exact science it has long aspired to be. Achieving this will also entail gaining complete control over our genes. In our natural state, cells reproduce by copying the DNA in each nucleus. If there is a problem with the DNA sequence in a group of cells, there is no way to address it without updating it in every individual cell. This is an advantage in unenhanced biological organisms, because random mutations within individual cells are unlikely to cause fatal damage to the whole body. If any mutation in any cell in our bodies were instantly copied to every other cell, we wouldn\u2019t be able to survive. But the decentralized robustness of biology is a major challenge to a species (like ours) that can edit individual cells\u2019 DNA fairly well but has not yet mastered the nanotechnology needed to edit DNA effectively throughout the whole body. If instead each cell\u2019s DNA code were controlled by a central server (as many electronic systems are), then we could change the DNA code by simply updating it once from that \u201ccentral server.\u201d To do this, we would augment each cell\u2019s nucleus with a nanoengineered counterpart\u2014a system that would receive the DNA code from the central server and then produce a sequence of amino acids from this code. I use \u201ccentral server\u201d here as a shorthand for a more centralized broadcast architecture, but this probably does not mean every nanobot getting direct instructions from literally one computer. The physical challenges of nanoscale engineering might ultimately dictate that a more localized broadcast system is preferable. But even if there are hundreds or thousands of micro-scale (as opposed to nanoscale) control units placed around our bodies (which would be large enough for more complex communications with an overall control computer), this would be orders of magnitude more centralization than the status quo: independent functioning by tens of trillions of cells. The other parts of the protein synthesis system, such as the ribosome, could be augmented in the same fashion. In this way we could simply turn off activity from malfunctioning DNA, whether it is responsible for cancer or genetic disorders. The nanocomputer maintaining this process would also implement the biological algorithms that govern epigenetics\u2014how genes are expressed and activated. As of the early 2020s, we still have a lot to learn about gene expression, but AI will allow us to simulate it in enough detail by the time nanotechnology is mature that nanobots will be able to precisely regulate it. With this technology we\u2019ll also be able to prevent and reverse the accumulation of DNA transcription errors, which are a major cause of aging. Nanobots will also be useful for neutralizing urgent threats to the body\u2014destroying bacteria and viruses, halting autoimmune reactions, or drilling through clogged arteries. In fact, recent research by Stanford and Michigan State University has already created a nanoparticle that finds the monocytes and macrophages that cause atherosclerotic plaque and eliminates those cells. Smart nanobots will be vastly more effective. Initially such treatments would be initiated by humans, but ultimately they will be carried out autonomously; the nanobots will perform tasks on their own and report their activities (via a controlling AI interface) to humans monitoring them. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy As AI gains greater ability to understand human biology, it will be possible to send nanobots to address problems at the cellular level long before they would be detectable by today\u2019s doctors. In many cases this will allow prevention of conditions that remain unexplained in 2023. Today, for example, about 25 percent of ischemic strokes are \u201ccryptogenic\u201d\u2014they have no detectable cause. But we know they must happen for some reason. Nanobots patrolling the bloodstream could detect small plaques or structural defects at risk of creating stroke-causing clots, break up forming clots, or raise the alarm if a stroke is silently unfolding. Just as with hormone optimization, though, nanomaterials will allow us to not just restore normal body function but augment it beyond what our biology alone makes possible. Biological systems are limited in strength and speed because they must be constructed from protein. Although these proteins are three-dimensional, they have to be folded from a one-dimensional string of amino acids. Engineered nanomaterials won\u2019t have this limitation. Nanobots built from diamondoid gears and rotors would be thousands of times faster and stronger than biological materials, and designed from scratch to perform optimally. Thanks to these advantages, even our blood supply may be replaced by nanobots. A design by founding Singularity University nanotechnology cochair Robert A. Freitas called the respirocyte is an artificial red blood cell. According to Freitas\u2019 calculations, someone with respirocytes in his bloodstream could hold his breath for about four hours. In addition to artificial blood cells, we\u2019ll eventually be able to engineer artificial lungs to oxygenate them more efficiently than the respiratory system that biology has given us. Ultimately, even hearts made from nanomaterials will make people immune to heart attacks and make cardiac arrest due to trauma much rarer. Yet the most important role of nanotech in our bodies will be augmenting the brain\u2014which will eventually become more than 99.9 percent nonbiological. There are two distinct pathways by which this will happen. One is the gradual introduction of nanobots to the brain tissue itself. These may be used to repair damage or replace neurons that have stopped working. The other is connecting the brain to computers, which will both provide the ability to control machines directly with our thoughts and allow us to integrate digital layers of neocortex in the cloud. This will go far beyond just better memory or faster thinking. A deeper virtual neocortex will give us the ability to think thoughts more complex and abstract than we can currently comprehend. As a dimly suggestive example, imagine being able to clearly and intuitively visualize and reason about 10-dimensional shapes. That sort of facility will be possible across many domains of cognition. For comparison, the cerebral cortex (which is mainly made up of the neocortex) has an average of 16 billion neurons, in a volume of roughly half a liter. Ralph Merkle\u2019s design for a nanoscale mechanical computing system could theoretically pack more than 80 quintillion logic gates into the same amount of space. And the speed advantage would be enormous: The electrochemical switching speed of mammalian neuron firing probably averages within an order of magnitude of once per second, as compared with likely around 100 million to 1 billion cycles per second for nanoengineered computation. Even if only a minuscule fraction of these values are achievable in practice, it is clear that such technology will allow the digital parts of our brain (stored on nonbiological computing substrates) to vastly outnumber and outperform the biological ones. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy My estimate is that the computations inside the human brain (at the level of neurons) is on the order of 1014 per second. As of early 2023, $1,000 of computing power could perform up to 48 trillion computations per second. Based on the 2000\u20132022 trend, by 2053 about $1,000 of computing power (in 2023 dollars) will be enough to perform more than 1 million times as many computations per second as the unenhanced human brain. If it turns out, as I suspect, that only a fraction of the brain\u2019s neurons are necessary to digitize the conscious mind (e.g., if we don\u2019t have to simulate the actions of many cells that govern the actions of the body\u2019s other organs), this point could be reached several years sooner. And even if it turns out that digitizing our conscious minds requires simulating every protein in every neuron (which I think is unlikely), it might take a few more decades to reach that level of affordability\u2014but it\u2019s still something that would happen within the lifetimes of many people living today. In other words, because this future depends on fundamental exponential trends, even if we greatly change our assumptions about how easy it will be to affordably digitize ourselves, that won\u2019t vastly change the date by which this milestone will be reached. In the 2040s and 2050s, we will rebuild our bodies and brains to go vastly beyond what our biological bodies are capable of, including their backup and survival. As nanotechnology takes off, we will be able to produce an optimized body at will: We\u2019ll be able to run much faster and longer, swim and breathe under the ocean like fish, and even give ourselves working wings if we want them. We will think millions of times faster, but most importantly, we will not be dependent on the survival of any of our bodies for our selves to survive.

Lauren Goode Michael Calore Apple executives used the keynote address of this week's annual WWDC developers conference to debut all of the artificial intelligence capabilities that are coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The team showed off how generative tools will help users write emails, clean up iPhone photos, illustrate presentations, and make custom emoji characters. Adding AI to everything is par for the course in 2024, as all of the Big Tech companies have been loading up their software with similar generative features. But Apple is late to this particular party. The company has been perceived as being \u201cbehind\u201d in generative AI, since OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and a whole bunch of startups have already made massive inroads. But is Apple really behind? And what makes Apple\u2019s AI\u2014cheekily named Apple Intelligence\u2014different? This week, we welcome WIRED senior writer Will Knight back onto the show to talk about Apple Intelligence, the new Siri, and how Apple is trying to differentiate itself in the AI race. Read Will\u2019s new story about Apple Intelligence\u2019s launch, and his news analysis piece on how Apple will need to make sure its AI doesn\u2019t disappoint, annoy, or offend iPhone users. Read Boone Ashworth\u2019s roundup of everything Apple announced at WWDC. Lauren tells us why Apple\u2019s AI play is also its best shot at getting you to upgrade your iPhone. Julian Chokkattu has a comprehensive overview of all the AI features coming to iOS. Read all of our WWDC coverage. Will recommends the AutoGen multi-agent conversational framework.

By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: Do you generally subscribe to the idea that Apple doesn't do things first, but then often does it better? Michael Calore: Yeah, I mean, it worked with the iPod. It worked with the iPad very well. It has maybe not worked with Vision Pro. They came out with the iPhone first, but I'm not entirely sold on iPhones. I mean, I use a Pixel. Lauren Goode: It seems like they did something right with the iPhone, but you are not sold. Michael Calore: Yeah. I mean, by and large, though, yes, Apple has done very well with its wait-and-see and then do it better than everybody else approach. Lauren Goode: What about AI? Michael Calore: What about it? Lauren Goode: Do you think that Apple's artificial intelligence is going to be better than the other tech companies? Michael Calore: I mean, maybe Apple Intelligence looks good, but it's not going to make me switch to an iPhone. I mean, it's not that much different than what I already have in my Pixel, right? The features they showed off, they're pretty familiar to me at this point. Somebody who lives in the world. Lauren Goode: We should talk about this. And not specific to phones, but just AI in general. Michael Calore: OK, fine. Lauren Goode: Let's do it. [Gadget Lab intro theme music plays] Lauren Goode: Hey, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED. Michael Calore: And I'm Michael Calore. I'm WIRED's director of consumer tech and culture. Lauren Goode: Such a fancy title. I'm still not over your new title. We're also joined this week by WIRED\u2019s senior writer, Will Knight, who has joined us before to talk all about AI. Will, you're so close but so far away. You are dialing in from a hotel room in Cupertino, just about an hour south of where we are. We couldn't bring you into the lab here, but it's nice to have you on this coast. Will Knight: Yeah, thank you for having me. It's nice to be back. Lauren Goode: So today, we're talking about Apple. Yep. This week was WWDC, Apple's Annual Developers Conference. We had people on the ground there in Cupertino like Will. A lot of us were covering it from our desks. If you follow tech news or even if you're just longtime fans of our podcast here, as I'm sure most of you are, then you know how these developer conferences go. There are thousands of app makers gathered in one place where a series of tech executives go on stage and give keynote presentations and then later on host some developer-specific sessions. And it's all about building things on top of the latest and greatest software. And a lot of regular people will watch and listen to it because something like Apple's WWDC is basically going to change the way that your iPhone works. But this year, the conference was different because the last portion of it was entirely about AI, AI, AI, AI. We talk about this a lot on this show, but this is a really important one. Apple has been perceived as \"behind\" in generative AI since OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and a whole bunch of other startups have already made inroads. But is Apple really behind? And what makes Apple AI different? I mean, in addition to the different name they're giving it. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu So Will, based on your very expert opinion, what makes Apple's generative AI different from the others? Will Knight: Well, they are not unveiling a huge language model or a competitor to ChatGPT that's going to be more capable than everybody else's. They're limiting what their AI does. And they're trying to emphasize running AI on devices, which is part of their whole privacy and security marketing thing partly. So in a sense, they are behind and then they've not unveiled anything that's as capable as ChatGPT, but I do think that you're right to question whether they're really that behind because the stuff they've developed running on devices, it's pretty impressive in its own way, and I'm not sure anybody's going to notice that much, the difference between their AI and one of these more powerful models in many instances. Lauren Goode: So they're calling it Apple Intelligence. And as you mentioned, they're not doing what ChatGPT is doing because they didn't develop a separate chatbot or a search engine. This is all happening on your iPhone or another Apple device. Based on the demos that you saw, tell us exactly how it works and what it looks like. Why is this AI any different from other stuff we've been doing on our phones? Will Knight: Yeah. I mean, it's \u2026 So I had some demos today, so I got to see some of this Apple Intelligence sprinkled across things, and rather than being a standalone app like Gemini or ChatGPT, as you say, it pervades a lot of different tools. I mean, I think some of it is relatively similar to the stuff that we've seen Google develop, but it seems a little more seamless, a little bit more well-integrated or thoughtfully integrated into devices. So, for example, in your email or in any application in macOS or iOS on a sufficiently advanced device, you can highlight text and then have it summarized or rewrite it in a particular style. It has the ability \u2026 You can take a drawing or sketch and turn that into a generative AI image. You can have this thing called Genmoji, create a new emoji for you, which I suspect might be the killer app that nobody really expected. But all of those tools, they don't seem to me to be super, super sophisticated in terms of the capabilities that they're demonstrating. ChatGPT can do a lot more sophisticated text generation or whatever. It's a little bit more like they just seem to be putting the products first, which I think is probably a sensible approach when everybody's getting very obsessed with saying whose AI is bigger or better than the others. But I think that they have quite consciously limited it, which is probably sensible in some ways because the technology is prone to go off the rails and do crazy stuff, which it may well still do. When we see people generating their own emojis, they claim to have put a lot of guardrails out, and I'm sure they have. But no doubt, people will come up with something offensive before too long. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: Yeah, I'm sure you're right. That is going to be the killer app most likely. Lauren Goode: Siri's going to flirt with us. Will Knight: Well, I was asking about this because, obviously, OpenAI's new ChatGPT is notoriously a flirt and they have very consciously not made Siri \u2026 They could have actually, I think, added much more emotional emphasis and intonation into the voice. The new Siri they've unveiled with Apple Intelligence behind is much better at handling a conversation. So similar to the new ChatGPT, it can handle pauses and corrections and that will make it much better at being able to take commands, but they very consciously have not made it too emotionally or socially anthropomorphized, I guess. Definitely not a flirt they promised. Michael Calore: The thing that a lot of the voice interaction chatbots have been trying to achieve is this idea of context awareness and it keeps getting better and better. And, obviously, the demos that Apple was showing on stage, which is on a video, is they're prerecorded so they're not live demos. And I'm curious if you had any experience in a live demo with Siri because the thing that is the big advancement that a lot of folks are pointing to, the thing that's really going to change how Siri feels is that context awareness. It's the ability for you to ask a question, get an answer, and then ask a follow-up question without having to repeat the key information, like the name of the movie that you were looking for or the time that you were talking about. It just remembers the things that you had just said within the last 30, 40 seconds. Alexa has been able to do this for a long time. Google's chat assistant has been able to do this for a while. Lauren Goode: I think what Mike is saying is that it's really easy to make a good AI demo. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Does it work? Will Knight: Well, they gave me and some others some demos, but they didn't let us play with it. I mean, it did seem to work better, but, yeah, we'll have to see if it's that much better. The other thing that \u2026 They emphasized this idea of it being very personalized, this is one of their key things. They're like, \"It's going to be so much more useful because it draws on your information.\" And it seems like Siri can tap into a lot of apps. It can look into those apps and it can also use the automations that you can already do on the iPhone to do some useful stuff. But I didn't see very much in summarizing or rewriting your emails or the interaction in Siri that seemed like it was very personalized. They're very much limiting how much you can train the models based on your data. And I didn't see anything that really struck me as like, \"Wow, that makes it way more useful.\" Perhaps it is if you can really get into those apps and do things, but it wasn't clear from the demos. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: Will, you mentioned privacy earlier. One thing that Apple is doing is they've created some private cloud so that when an AI process or request can't happen on the device, it gets offloaded to the cloud. But Apple is saying, \u201cYeah, but it's with our private servers running on Apple silicon.\u201d Michael Calore: It's the good cloud. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Explain how this works. Will Knight: Right. So, yeah, they've talked about this and put out this white paper showing how when a query does go off to the cloud, information is kept in some secure part of the silicon and they've got this whole architecture which is meant to be verified, but it's secure so outsiders can verify that it's all secure and everything is encrypted end to end. So in theory, it provides you with some assurance that your data is not being handed off to someone else or couldn't leak out in theory. But interestingly, in the demos they gave, it didn't seem like the model ever handed off to the cloud. It seemed like they're really focusing on doing stuff on device. I'm not sure when they would actually do that. Maybe they're more future proofing this for when they do develop their own much more powerful models. They're talking about this working with the iPhone Pro up in terms of smartphones as well as all the M1 laptops. So it's limiting the devices or work on. So for things like your HomePod won't be able to do some of this stuff and it didn't seem like they would be handing that off to the cloud in a way that would make it more capable. So I think there's some questions about really what the utility is. Obviously, it's a big part of their branding to say that they're very privacy and security focused and it is a problem with generative AI that you're handing your data off to God knows who and use some of these things. So it makes sense to emphasize that. I don't know really how useful that is. I mean, it's also something that other people haven't really shown that much focus on trying to integrate the two, but I think it'll be interesting to see how that really, if that really makes it way more capable, if that works seamlessly because you don't want to be waiting for ages as it tries to talk to the cloud. Lauren Goode: Will, I'm picturing when you're saying that you had these very controlled demos in a room and that everything seemed to be happening on device, I'm guessing that they were just handing all the other queries off to Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas behind the scenes who were just, I don't know, pulling on different punch cards, math cards to run this. That's their private cloud. Will Knight: So it's just humans. Lauren Goode: Yeah, it's just a bunch of humans, but they're wearing all-white jumpsuits. This is very Apple. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: The Mechanical Turk. Lauren Goode: Yeah, exactly. Will Knight: It could be. I didn't ask that. Michael Calore: I think \u2026 Lauren, you wrote a story about the fact that you have to have the latest phone, right? iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or the new iPhones that are going to be coming out this fall are the only ones that are going to get these features when the features come out. They're going to come out in beta on iOS 18 and then they'll roll into iOS 18 with an update probably later in the year, mostly 2025 is what we're looking at for all of these. So there will be a bunch of people out there who have the new phone or the best phone from last year, and they'll be able to run these, but if you have an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 14, you can't run it and people feel like it's a bad practice for Apple to do that. It's like cheating people out, encouraging people to upgrade to the latest hardware. Now, normally, I would agree with you because I'm a very cynical person and I see companies using this as an opportunity to get people to go out and spend money on the best smartphones they can buy, which they don't need. A cheap phone is great. But I do think that historically Apple has so heavily prioritized the best user experience. They want it to feel seamless and super fast and amazing every time you use it. And maybe on an iPhone 15 or on an iPhone 14, it's a little slow, a little sluggish, and not as impressive. So they're limiting it. They're putting a gate on it so that you don't have that bad experience. Lauren Goode: I just wish Apple would tell us. I mean, I asked Will, you and I were chatting about it yesterday, and when you were on the ground, you had the chance to ask. I don't know if you ever got a response, but I would just like a clear explanation as to why it is limited to the best devices with the fastest chips. Because otherwise, it does just seem like it's something of a product differentiation strategy that they're going to compel people to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro in the coming months or then in September, the iPhone 16 model. Some of the analysts I spoke to said like this could potentially supercharge the iPhone sales cycle. iPhone sales have been in a slump for a while. And so maybe this is part of a ploy to drive phone sales, but actually that probably wouldn't happen for a while still. It probably wouldn't be a gangbusters thing in September because it's still a relatively unproven AI experience and a lot of people aren't going to care about it. There are going to be just as many consumers, I think, who say a midrange phone or an older phone is just fine. I don't need the Genmoji. I don't need Siri summarizing my 8,700 notifications. I don't need this just yet. And then eventually, it could drive adoption of newer hardware as it becomes more widespread. But just having an understanding exactly of why it needs to be the A17 Pro chip and M1 or M2 Ultra and beyond would be great. Maybe we'll get some documentation on that eventually. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Will Knight: Yeah, I didn't get a clear answer for that. I talked to Brenda Stolyar, our colleague, who heard that it was to do with having a certain amount of RAM on the device, which is further confusing. Yeah, I don't know that it makes that much sense where they've drawn the line. Also, I would have thought the idea of this private compute cloud was that you could hand stuff off if you had an older device. So, yeah, it's \u2026 Michael Calore: Yeah, that would make sense. Will Knight: \u2026 a bit confusing. Lauren Goode: Right. Will Knight: Well, the features that they've shown don't seem to be the very, very most cutting-edge AI models, and you can run some pretty similarly capable stuff in my experience on older hardware. Well, they maybe just want to sell more iPhones, I guess. Lauren Goode: So it sounds like what's different here is that Apple's Intelligence \"is integrated into their devices, they haven't launched a separate chatbot or search engine.\" They're saying it's much more private because a lot of the processing is going to happen on device, and then if not, they're going to offload it to their super special private Apple cloud. And Apple hasn't revealed any massive LLM or something like that that would be comparable to what you'd see with ChatGPT and Gemini and with \u2026 What are the others now? Bard, I guess. No, Bard is being- Michael Calore: The Bard is Gemini. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Is that correct, Will? Will Knight: Right, yeah. Lauren Goode: In cloud, yeah. Will Knight: Yeah, they haven't shown off something like that. Also, interestingly, the demo they did, I asked about the copyright of some of the data they were using and it sounded, at least for the image-generating stuff, that they weren't using conventional copyrighted material. They were using stuff they were compensating artists for, this is what they were claiming, and had had their own artists generate stuff. I mean, I think that will limit what you can produce much more and perhaps means you don't need such a large model, but I think their approach to copyright and training might be interesting as well. Lauren Goode: Oh, that's interesting. I'm glad that they're paying artists. I mean, they do have to worry about their bottom line and whether or not they're going to go broke, but that's good to know. All right, let's take a quick break and then we come back, we're going to talk about how Apple AI is similar to other AI products that we've talked about a lot on this show. And then maybe cover some of the other announcements that came out of WWDC. More after the break. [Break] Lauren Goode: OK. So we've already talked about how Apple is trying to distinguish itself from other AI-focused tech companies with the big reveal of Apple Intelligence, but we're also wondering what are the ways in which Apple AI just seems like the same old, same old, just a lot of the stuff we've already been doing on our phones. And Will, we also wanted to ask you about some of the other announcements that came out of WWDC quickly. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu OK. So first, what are some of the ways in which you saw Apple Intelligence and thought, \"Yep, we could already do that?\" Will Knight: Well, I think everything they showed is already something you could do with ChatGPT or another tool if you \u2026 Some of the features integrated into email or notes are similar to what Google has shown off in its Docs and Gmail. Even the \u2026 The thing that got the biggest cheer, which I was surprised about, was bringing the calculator to the iPad, weirdly. Lauren Goode: Yeah, this was wild. I actually couldn't believe it as I was watching the livestream. I thought it was a sound effect when you're watching an old sitcom and they've got the clapping. I was like, \"Is this an inserted round of cheers from the crowd?\" And the calculator. Will Knight: I'm not lying. A guy right next to me said, \"Oh my god,\" as that was announced, which was pretty impressive. Then they showed writing out equations and drawing a little chart and the ability to interpret that give you an answer, turn that into a real chart, is pretty slick and impressive. And that involves a multimodal model, a model that can use images and read handwriting as well as past language. But that's quite similar to what both OpenAI and Google showed off at their developer events or whatever events recently. So I don't think any of it was beyond what other people have shown. I mean, far from it, it seemed pretty table stakes. And I mean, I do think, though, partly that is probably quite deliberate in that they're trying to avoid the gaffes that seem to come with using this stuff. They're trying to limit it. Apple's not \u2026 Or probably doesn't want to be associated with the controversies that happen often with generative AI. So I think they're trying to limit it somewhat in that way. Michael Calore: Another thing that feels like table stakes is Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI. There's ChatGPT built right into the user experience now. So particularly like with a Siri query or a typed query, if you're asking it a question that it can't answer, it says, \"Would you like to ask ChatGPT this question?\" And then you tap yes. And then it goes off and asks ChatGPT that question. So a couple of things. First of all, that's clunky and weird that they built a step into it. I understand why they did that because they want to make it very, very clear that you're no longer using an Apple product. You are now going to use somebody else's product. So if the experience sucks, you can't blame Apple. But also, they hinted that they're going to have other models available at some point. So it's possible that just like you get to pick a browser, you will get to pick an agent, a user agent that you send your requests off to. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: Yeah. And the avatar looks like Sam Altman who was there, by the way. And he'll go down in history as one of the most poly-AI-morous people out there because now he's working with both Microsoft and Apple. I mean, we should do a whole other podcast on Sam Altman, but what a coup. Michael Calore: You came up with a name. Lauren Goode: Poly-AI-morous. That was really bad, wasn't it? Michael Calore: No, it was brilliant. It was brilliant AI and\u2014 Lauren Goode: Yeah. But Mike, to your point, it's like, \"Oh, then the alternative option here, ChatGPT,\" which we could all use on our phones anyway. Will Knight: Yeah, it seems to me like it's more about pleasing or appeasing investors and regulators doing that. They're trying to show\u2014 Michael Calore: How so? Will Knight: Well, people want to think Apple is at the cutting edge. So they're trying to show that they are by making that available. And then I guess they're running into trouble around having Google as the default search that they're talking about having different AI models available to people. But the demos that they've given, I wonder if the way that they've set it up is it makes ChatGPT that much less useful. They're showing these things like you take a picture of ... I mean, I don't really know how people use ChatGPT that much, but take a picture of some vegetables and then ask what to make for dinner. I mean, do people really do that? It seems you have to be slightly mad to do that, I would say. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it's a funny hedge, it seems. Lauren Goode: Will, were there any announcements not related to Apple Intelligence that you heard firsthand at the event and you thought, \"That sounds pretty nifty. I'm into that?\" Will Knight: I like the real-time translate on your watch, on the Apple Watch, weirdly. Lauren Goode: Are you an Apple Watch wearer? Will Knight: I do have an Apple Watch, but I've also traveled a bunch and I tried to use \u2026 In China, they used to sell these things that would \u2026 They used deep learning models to recognize your speech, but then this was pre-large language models, so try and translate things, but you'd say something to somebody and then play it and they'd be like, \"What are you talking about?\" And then they'd say something back and it would get even more garbled. And it was \u2026 But in principle, it seemed like a cool idea. And I think if you try the latest ChatGPT and said, \"Tell it to translate,\" I think they're pretty impressive. And so I thought that could be quite useful. Obviously, the calculator was a huge deal for me. Lauren Goode: Oh my god. Will Knight: There were a lot of \u2026 My first WWDC and I was amazed at how many gasps there were in the crowd when they announced a new little widget or icon or something. Seemed pretty crazy. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: So the NIPS Conference isn't like that? Will Knight: The which conference? Lauren Goode: The NIPS Conference. NIPS. Will Knight: NeurIPS. Lauren Goode: NeurIPS, oops. It used to be called NIPS, wasn't it? Will Knight: They used to, be called that, they had to change it. Lauren Goode: And it changed. Will Knight: Yes. Lauren Goode: Tell us about how NeurIPS compares. Will Knight: NeurIPS is a little more\u2014 Michael Calore: You might want to retake that. Lauren Goode: It's OK. Leave it in. So you're saying it's different from the NeurIPS Conference. Will Knight: It's a bit different from that, yeah. NeurIPS is the premier AI conference, which has become ridiculous because there's so much AI research happening and it's all very, very in the weeds focused on the latest models and capabilities and training data and all this stuff. So, yes, very different to that for me. It was fun to be there. I was amazed that they basically pulled you all together and then just play a video at you. It seems ridiculous. Like something from Silicon Valley. Lauren Goode: I mean, you flew across the country for that, Will. Will Knight: Yeah. I did wonder what was going on. Lauren Goode: What about messaging? We should talk about messaging because I think that's one of the biggest announcements. Michael Calore: I would love to talk about messaging. First of all, the fact that you can satellite message for non-emergency situations, I think, is very cool. There's not a lot of detail about how this is going to work and a lot of people have tons of questions about this, but basically, if you don't have a data connection and you want to send a text or receive a text, you can just open a satellite connection and send a text or receive a text. Apple has been providing two years of free satellite messaging for emergency situations with iPhones. We do not know whether or not that is going to be extended to non-emergency situations. Probably not. Might require a plan. Maybe you can get pay as you go, but people want to know, can I use it \u2026 Is it just for the wilderness? Is it just for places where there is no connection or can I use it at places where the Wi-Fi sucks or where the reception sucks? Like at a concert when there's 60,000 people, you often can't send a text message because all of the tubes are so clogged. Lauren Goode: Or on a plane. Michael Calore: Or on an airplane. Can I use it there? All kinds of questions about that. So people are very excited. They want to know everything about satellite messaging. I think they're probably not going to get what they want. Lauren Goode: Well, it's going to cost money, I think. Michael Calore: Yes. And \u2026 By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: That's my guess. Michael Calore: \u2026 I'd be shocked if they let you use it on airplanes. Lauren Goode: Well, airplanes, I think it would be the most useful just for 2FA. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: Have you ever had that experience where this happens a lot? I go to log in to my Cond\u00e9 email when I'm on a plane and I get \u2026 Mike's shaking his head. Michael Calore: No. Lauren Goode: And I'm not logged in, so I'm like, \"OK, I got to log in,\" and then I have to authenticate and I'm waiting for the 2FA code and I can't get it because it comes via SMS. Michael Calore: Yeah, no. Lauren Goode: Why are you saying no? It's not happened to you? Michael Calore: No, I don't work on airplanes. Airplanes are me time. Lauren Goode: Who are you? What have you done with Michael? Michael Calore: I'm a person who does not work on air \u2026 I've never worked on an airplane. Lauren Goode: What do you do on airplanes? Michael Calore: I read, I sleep, I listen to podcasts, I stare out the window. Lauren Goode: Watch B movies. Michael Calore: Yeah, no, I watch excellent movies. Lauren Goode: Do you cry? Michael Calore: Sometimes. Lauren Goode: Just in general or from the movies? Michael Calore: From the Apple Vision Pro putting pressure on my face. Lauren Goode: Touche. Well, sometimes I work \u2026 All right. Sometimes I don't want to work and I just want to spend the time clearing out my inbox. Michael Calore: Yeah, that's still work. Lauren Goode: It is, but it's mindless work. It's just like batch select, mark as spam, delete. Michael Calore: That's what Uber rides are for. Lauren Goode: No, I get nauseous in the back of an Uber when I do that. Anyway. I really hope this satellite messaging works on planes, but you know people are going to abuse that, right? Let's say there's \u2026 Not abuse it, that's not the right word, but \u2026 Michael Calore: Oh, sure. Lauren Goode: \u2026 what is deemed essential will be different for different people. Michael Calore: Oh, yes. Lauren Goode: Someone's in a massive fight with their spouse and they're like, \"I got a text right now,\" or something like that, versus, \"I need to make an emergency call.\" Michael Calore: I'm sure all of us have been in a situation where we either send or receive a text right before they tell us that we have to go into airplane mode and then we spend the entire rest of the airplane ride with our brains spinning. Imagine if that was a thing of the past. Imagine if you didn't have to worry about that anymore. You could just\u2014 Lauren Goode: It's too soon. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: You could just send a text message. Lauren Goode: Genmoji. Michael Calore: Genmoji, not interested. We should talk about RCS. Lauren Goode: Oh, we should. We should talk about it for approximately four seconds because that's how long Apple spent talking about it on stage, despite the fact that it's one of the things people are most interested in, RCS being rich communication service, which is, a \u2026 I'm having word retrieval issues right now. What's the \u2026 not a platform. It's a \u2026 Michael Calore: Protocol. Lauren Goode: \u2026 standard \u2026 It's a protocol. Thank you very much. It's a protocol. This reminds me of the episode we did with Will a few weeks back. It's a protocol that is supposed to bridge the gaps that exist between iPhone blue bubble text messaging and Android text messaging. By the way, most people around the world have an Android phone and rely on other messaging apps to message each other. Anyway. But iMessage has this lock, this grip on iPhone users, because it uses Apple's data network and then all the messages that you can send from iPhone to iPhone, you have all these cool features, but those don't translate to your green bubble friends on Android. RCS was supposed to level the playing field for that. It's a standard or a protocol that Google was very much behind. They had gotten the wireless carriers on board. And so then last year, at some point, Apple said, \"Fine, we'll support RCS.\" This was largely seen as a response to some of the regulation that's happening in the EU around tech companies and to pressure here in the States on Apple to be more fair about the whole messaging thing, but they just glossed over it. They're like, \"Oh, and by the way, RCS support. OK, let's move on.\" Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: And then there was \u2026 It was a little icon on a page of all the things that the new iOS is going to have. Michael Calore: Yeah. I'm not holding out hope that Apple's implementation is going to be excellent. I am ready to be surprised by that. I'm being open-minded about it. The big thing is that it's secure end-to-end encrypted conversations between devices. But the other thing is that if you're on an Android phone and you're talking to a bunch of people with iPhones, group texts don't work, videos come in as crunchy, little pixelated shit storms. They don't look like real actual videos. It's very annoying. And if they can just fix some of those minor annoyances that make the two platforms more interoperable, then everybody will be OK. There will be world peace and we can all move on with our lives. Lauren Goode: That's just the bare minimum. Plus, secure. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: That's it. Michael Calore: I think people don't care. People have been trading security for features for eons. And I think that as long as they can just make it work, it doesn't have to \u2026 I mean, if it's RCS, it will be secure, but I don't think that people are that concerned about security. I think they're more concerned about\u2014 By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Lauren Goode: Do you think they're just journalist nerds who care about it? Michael Calore: I just want to see your cat photo. Lauren Goode: Yeah, or something else. Michael Calore: Or I just don't want to be left out. Lauren Goode: Right. Right. Or I don't want to be the person who's on the group thread who's accused of making everything worse because I'm the person on Android. Michael Calore: Yeah, because it's not my fault, it's Apple's fault. I'm sorry I'm making this personal. Lauren Goode: No, I think that's OK. Michael Calore: Speaking of personalized experiences. Lauren Goode: I think this is very fair. Will, do you have group chats where there's some ... You must because you're from the UK. Our producer's telling us that we are definitely out of time, but now I need to know the answer, Will, because you're from the UK. And presumably, you have lots of friends over there. And so do you have group chats where people are on Android? Will Knight: They tend to be on WhatsApp, honestly. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: See, that's exactly it. Michael Calore: There you go. Will Knight: WhatsApp is so popular in England. Yeah. Michael Calore: Yep. Lauren Goode: And you could do all those fun things in WhatsApp, too. You can record voice notes and do tap backs and emoji and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Will Knight: Just wait until you get the first Genmoji and then you'll be rushing to update your hardware. Lauren Goode: I know. I have an iPhone 15. That's the thing about not really reviewing phones anymore, which I did for a decade of my life, is that I feel not at all compelled to get the newest phone anymore. Michael Calore: You have to buy them like a plebian. Oh, you're saying you\u2019re OK with it. Lauren Goode: Just myself. Yeah. I'm OK. And so I have the 15, I don't have the Pros, so I'm going to have to figure that out. I do think I'm going to be a little bit \u2026 I don't know about Genmoji as much as tapbacks. I'm convinced people these days have entire relationships through tapbacks and that's OK. I'm OK with that. Will Knight: Can you use a Genmoji in your tapback phone? Can you\u2014 Lauren Goode: I think you can. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: I think you can. I think you can, right? Will Knight: That's the dream. Lauren Goode: Right. Yeah. Will Knight: That's the generative dream. Lauren Goode: Yeah, that's the \u2026 Well, I'm glad we've established that, Will. Papers upon papers about the advances of artificial intelligence and we have arrived at Genmoji as a tapback is the dream. It's what we've always wanted. Will, thank you so much for this. Stick around. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, we're going to do our recommendations. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu [Break] Lauren Goode: All right. Will, as our guest of honor, what is your recommendation this week? Will Knight: OK. I'm going to recommend this software framework called AutoGen, which is relatively straightforward to use. It's from Microsoft and it lets several AI models or personas of a language model work together to solve a task. It's interesting because there's been a bunch of papers that have came out at research conferences and so on showing that when models work together, sometimes they can solve things that one model can't on its own, and sometimes they can be much more reliable. And this is quite fun because you can create different personas in the models and watch them go back and forth and argue with each other, which I find entertaining, even if no one else does. Michael Calore: Apocalyptic. Will Knight: Yeah, a little bit. Michael Calore: So it's like teamwork. Teamwork makes the dream work. Will Knight: Yes. Right. That's the idea. I mean, it's interesting because, to some degree, it's really just about, rather than this being humans that are working together. And actually, what it's really doing in a way is providing a clever way to refine the prompt that goes into a model. So it's not clear if you really need to have different models working together as teams or whether you really just need a much better way to interrogate these models, which is what that enables. But it's fun \u2026 I think it's really interesting that people are experimenting with these different tools. Maybe the future of Apple Intelligence is a lot of different series arguing over what to recommend for dinner or working together or something like that. Lauren Goode: Agents. \u201cAgents.\u201d Will Knight: Right. Lauren Goode: And how can someone find AutoGen? Will Knight: I'd recommend googling AutoGen because I can't remember\u2014 Lauren Goode: How do you spell that? Will Knight: A-U-T-O-G-E-N. And you'll find the GitHub page where you can download and play with it. Michael Calore: Ooh, tarballs. Lauren Goode: Fun. Michael Calore: Great. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Will Knight: Absolutely. Lauren Goode: And it's free, Will? Will Knight: It's free, yeah. Lauren Goode: It's on GitHub. Yeah. Will Knight: Yeah. Lauren Goode: OK. Thanks for that. Mike, what's your recommendation? Michael Calore: I would like to recommend the Klean Kanteen Rise Food Box. Lauren Goode: That just sounds like you went to a word generator and spit up a bunch of words. Michael Calore: Yes. Lauren Goode: OK. Tell the people what this is. Michael Calore: So Klean Kanteen, that's Klean Kanteen with a K and a K. They make water bottles. Lauren Goode: Yeah. Michael Calore: They make other things, too, like travel mugs and shot glasses or whatever. Lauren Goode: Yeah, the Kardashians are behind it, right? It's a K, all the Ks. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: I have no idea. Lauren Goode: I'm just kidding. I made that up. Michael Calore: OK. Lauren Goode: It is the K thing. OK, please continue. Michael Calore: All right. So they make these food boxes that are basically like bento boxes, they're lunch boxes, and you pack them with food and you take them to work. We have returned to the office here at WIRED. I'm sure many people listening have returned to the office and maybe the catering system that you had before Covid is no longer around and you need to bring your lunch. What I'm saying is they're very useful for people who need to eat food during the work day. They're metal, which is very nice. They're also microwave safe. You can put them in the microwave to heat up your lunch. You have to take the lid off. The lid is not microwave safe. But my favorite thing about them is that they have this really powerful rubber seal. It's like a silicone ring around the lid that seals and then tabs that fold down and hold it down. Now, I ride my bike to and from work, so I'm always carrying my lunch in my bicycle bag. There's all kinds of problems with spilling if I use all of the different food boxes that I've had over the years. This one does not spill. And that's why I'm recommending it. The seal on it is excellent. It feels flimsy and you're like, \"I don't really know,\" but I've been using it for months now and not one spill. So I'm amazed. My bag, for the first time in my life, does not smell like kimchi. It just smells like a regular cycling bag. So, yeah, the Klean Kanteen Rise Food Box. I should note that Klean Kanteen made food boxes before this one that do not have the excellent seal on them. Those are also good, but I have\u2014 Lauren Goode: But you don't want to ride your bike with them. Michael Calore: Those have \u2026 I've encountered spills with those. Lauren Goode: OK. Michael Calore: The new version, the one that's out this year, 2024, that's the good one. Lauren Goode: How much does that cost approximately? Michael Calore: I have the one that's the medium size and I think it was $35. Lauren Goode: OK. Michael Calore: Which sounds like a lot. Lauren Goode: It's worth it. Michael Calore: But totally worth it. Lauren Goode: Yeah. That's a great recommendation. Michael Calore: Well, thank you. Lauren, what's your recommendation? Lauren Goode: My recommendation is the Lunya washable silk sleep mask. Michael Calore: Ooh. Lauren Goode: Ooh. Sorry to sound like an infomercial. I should hold it up and you go, \u201cOoh, tell me more.\u201d Michael Calore: Say more. Lauren Goode: You were actually a part of this thread when I got the Lunya. Do you remember this? By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: I do. Lauren Goode: Ooh. First, I'll tell you about the mask, which is, if you use a sleep mask or you're thinking about using a sleep mask, you can look up all kinds of different options. And I'm telling you, this one is probably the best. I mean, I haven't tried that many, but it's soft, it's pillowy, it's not too tight on your face. It's silk, so it's smooth. It's washable. It is just honestly one of the most comfortable sleep masks I've ever used. It has been game-changing for me. I was not really a sleep mask person before, but recently, I had a birthday and I was having a small birthday dinner and I brought this up to a group of friends who were all on a group chat, which was, yep, it turned green because Mike's on a Pixel. So at this dinner, I was saying to friends, \"Have any of you used a sleep mask? And if so, what's your pick?\" And everyone's, \"Oh, sure, yeah, we use sleep masks.\" And I was thinking, \"OK, well, I'm going to go home and I'm going to buy one for myself for my birthday.\" I was very tired. I was not drunk, I was just tired. And I passed out while I was googling sleep masks. And the next day, I got a notification saying, \"Your Lunya shipment is on the way.\" So I thought, \"Wow, I was really out of it.\" And I ordered a sleep mask for myself. Congratulations to me. And I wrote to you guys on the thread and I was like, \"You guys, I am such a dope. I was falling asleep last night and I ordered this Lunya thing.\" When it arrived, of course, I opened the box and there was a note from one of my dear friends on there saying, \"Happy birthday. You said you wanted a sleep mask.\" So actually, what had happened is that someone on the group thread had ordered it for me and I just thought I \u2026 I don't know. I was like a drunk wine mom without the wine. Michael Calore: And then they let you believe that you had sleep ordered it. Lauren Goode: Yes, which was the best part. That was actually the best part of the surprise was that for days, she just let me think that I did that. Michael Calore: Yeah. Lauren Goode: Yeah. So love my Lunya. I highly recommend if you're looking for a sleep mask. I think that model, I think it's expensive. It's like 50 bucks. Michael Calore: Oh wow. Lauren Goode: Expensive for a sleep mask. Michael Calore: This person really cares about you. Lauren Goode: Yeah, but there are versions that are closer to 35, I think. So I don't know, it's a tossup between the Klean Kanteen and the Lunya sleep mask. What matters more, a good night's sleep or spill-free Kanteen? By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu Michael Calore: Hot lunch. Lauren Goode: Hot lunch, baby. This all sound like euphemisms right now. OK, let's wrap up the show. Boone is dying. Our producer, poor Boone. Thank you, Will, for joining us and for tolerating us. This was really fun. Will Knight: You're very welcome. Thanks for having me. Lauren Goode: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can leave us a review. All I ask of you is that even if you don't like the show, you can write that, but give us five stars anyway because that helps our rating. But if you have other feedback, you can also find all of us on social media. We're very responsive there. Just check the show notes and we'll put our handles in. The show is produced by the excellent Boone Ashworth. Goodbye for now and we'll be back next week.

Lauren Goode: Is it just meow, meow, meow, meow? Will Knight: You have to pay for it. I haven't paid for it. Can I still recommend it? Michael Calore: Yes. Boone Ashworth: Is it CatGPT? Lauren Goode: Is it CatGPT? Will Knight: It's not called Cat \u2026 I have to find out what it's called now. I've downloaded it, but I was like, \"Oh, god, I've got to pay?\" Lauren Goode: I'll do it for free. Send me your prompt. What's your question, Mike? I'm CatGPT, send me your question. Michael Calore: Oh, can I say a command? Lauren Goode: Yeah, sure. Michael Calore: All right. Go back to sleep. Lauren Goode: Meow, meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. There you go.

By Steven Levy Ray Kurzweil rejects death. The 76-year-old scientist and engineer has spent much of his time on earth arguing that humans can not only take advantage of yet-to-be-invented medical advances to live longer, but also ultimately merge with machines, become hyperintelligent, and stick around indefinitely. Nonetheless, death cast a shadow over my interview with Kurzweil this spring. Just minutes before we met, we both learned that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist and one of Kurzweil\u2019s intellectual jousting partners, had suffered that fate. A few days before that, the science fiction author Vernor Vinge had also passed. Vinge\u2019s novels first described the singularity, that moment when superintelligent AI surpasses what humans can do and mere mortals need high-tech augmentation themselves to remain relevant. Kurzweil embraced the name for his own grand vision, and in 2005 wrote a best-selling book called The Singularity Is Near. He was by then an accomplished inventor and entrepreneur who had made breakthroughs in optical character recognition, synthesizer technology, and high-tech tools to boost accessibility. He\u2019s racked up numerous honors\u2014the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the $500,000 Lemelson\u2013MIT Prize, a Grammy. In 2012, Google hired him to head an AI lab. Back then, many people regarded his predictions as over the top. Computers achieving human-level intelligence by 2029? Way too soon! In the age of generative AI, that timeline seems conventional, if not conservative. So it\u2019s not surprising that Kurzweil\u2019s new book, out this month, is called The Singularity Is Nearer. A lot of the dotted lines in the first book\u2019s charts have now been filled in\u2014and are impressively on the mark. Still, even though I\u2019m bowled over by the technological advances that Kurzweil correctly predicted, I have trouble wrapping my (unaugmented) mind around his sunny scenario of our disembodied brains thriving hundreds of years from now in some kind of cloud consciousness. Kurzweil had suggested we meet at the public library in Newton, Massachusetts, near his home. He showed up wearing bright suspenders and a remarkably full head of hair\u2014kind of a Geppetto look, appropriate for someone trying to promote artificial beings to human status. We weaved our way through stacks of books\u2014destined to become fodder for the robots we\u2019d one day share consciousness with\u2014to a room he\u2019d reserved. As we spoke, Kurzweil periodically reached into a backpack to pull out a few charts, all showing dramatic improvements in domains ranging from computing power to average global income. We spent the afternoon talking about what immortality would be like, what he does at Google, and, of course, the looming singularity. I\u2019ve got some sad news. Did you hear that Daniel Kahneman died? Yeah. I heard that like five minutes ago. I've met with him a number of times. How old was he? Ninety. Oh, really? Nowadays people in their nineties can seem fine. Take my aunt. A psychologist, with a full assembly of patients she saw on a regular basis. At 98! She still had a sense of humor. I called her up once and she asked me, \u201cSo what are you doing?\u201d I told her I gave a speech about longevity escape velocity. That's where scientific progress undoes the passage of time. So you don't really use up time as you age. You do use up a year, every year, but you get back at least one year from scientific progress. We're not there yet, but that's what we're going for. And she said, \u201cCould we hurry up with that?\u201d That was actually the last conversation we had, because she died two weeks later. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Julian Chokkattu Ray Kurzweil takes about 80 pills a day to keep his health up. You seem to be at war with biology. Biology has a lot of limitations. A lot of analysts feel there's nothing inevitable about dying, and we're coming up with things to stop it. Basically we can get rid of death through aging. Some people think that something like 120 might be a hard stop for a human, but you think differently? Absolutely. There's no reason to stop at 120. What is the upper bound? There is no upper bound. Once we get past the singularity, we'll be able to put some AI connections inside our own brain. It\u2019s not going to be literally inside the brain, it's going to connect to the cloud. The advantage of a cloud is it's completely backed up. You\u2019re 76. Do you think you're going to live to see escape velocity? Yeah. I\u2019m in good shape. I actually measure where I am. If something is down, I take various prescriptions or medications to get back to being on the positive side of longevity. I\u2019m up to about 80 pills a day. [That\u2019s actually down from around 200, circa 2008.] The last time we talked I mentioned Steve Jobs\u2019 commencement speech at Stanford, where he called death \u201cnature\u2019s greatest invention,\u201d clearing the way for the new. You called it a death-ist position. Do you still see it that way? It's better not to die. We're not using up any resources that can't be replaced. The amount of sunlight that falls on Earth is 10,000 times what we need to create all of our energy. We'll use AI to create food and so on. So it's not like we\u2019re running out of resources. If I'm 300 years old, what will my life be like? Everything I grew up with would be different. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Julian Chokkattu Look at the change we\u2019ve already experienced. Certainly 20 years ago, you didn't have a smartphone, and you probably had a very primitive computer. If you're talking about hundreds of years, life is going to be enormously different. You're going have new experiences that are impossible today. But my true identity\u2014the me that you want to keep going forever\u2014was formed by the strong connections that I made in childhood. It seems random that I\u2019ll still be dealing with that centuries later. They say all your favorite songs are the songs you listened to when you were 14. When I'm 500 years old, am I going to be listening to the Rolling Stones for the billionth time? There's going to be new music. There's new music now. I still listen to the Rolling Stones. I listen to the Rolling Stones too. But there are new artists I appreciate. We'll also be able to do things we couldn't do before because our minds are going to expand. We're going to be attached to what we call a large language model, though I don't like that name, because large language models don\u2019t just deal with language. We'll be able to basically download knowledge and appreciate it. But there is an arc to life. I'll never be young again, no matter how healthy I may feel at age 150 or age 300. Maybe that\u2019s why if you live until your nineties, death seems less scary. You can say that, but when it comes time, you want to continue to live. People say, \u201cWell, I don't want to live past 99.\u201d But when they get to 99, they have a different view of it. If they wanted to die, they could die, and they don't die, unless they're in unbearable pain. You must be the only person who wasn't surprised when ChatGPT came out. It follows the timeline you laid out in the last century. That's true. I made that prediction in 1999. Some people at Stanford found that amazing. I guess I had enough credibility that they established a conference to discuss my opinion. If you look at the speeches then, they were all saying, \u201cYes, human-level intelligence will happen, but not in 30 years. It will happen in 100 years.\u201d Just recently, the predictions have come down. I say it\u2019s only five years away. Some people say it'll happen next year. How will we know when AGI is here? That's a very good question. I mean, I guess in terms of writing, ChatGPT\u2019s poetry is actually not bad, but it's not up to the best human poets. I'm not sure whether we'll achieve that by 2029. If it's not happening by then, it'll happen by 2032. It may take a few more years, but anything you can define will be achieved because AI keeps getting better and better. You believe that AI will write better novels than humans. But if you give people an amazing novel that changes their lives, and then tell them a robot wrote it, they will feel cheated. The human connection they felt while reading it was fraudulent. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Julian Chokkattu I'm aware that there\u2019s a prejudice against that. But it's not going to just be LLMs, or whatever we're going to call them, who will write the novels. We're going to combine with them. People will still look like humans, with normal human skin. But they will be a combination of the brains we're born with, as well as the brains that computers have, and they will be much smarter. When they do something, we will consider them human. We'll all have superhumans within our brains. Even after reading your book, I'm a little fuzzy about how that cloud connection happens. Let's say you do get to escape velocity, and you're living in 2050. How will your brain merge with the cloud? That\u2019s a big issue. A lot of things occur to you and you're not aware of where they came from. That'll be true of the additional computer mind that we connect ourselves to. There are people working on this now, actually being able to put things inside the brain for people who can't communicate with their own bodies. It needs to be faster than it is today. And I believe that will happen by the 2030s. When would you start connecting a child to the cloud? That's a good question. There are other ways to get inside the brain without doing it sort of mechanically. Do you think that the successors to LLMs will have what we call consciousness? To understand what's conscious and what isn't, you have to adopt a philosophical point of view. For 50 years, Marvin Minsky was my mentor. Whenever consciousness came up, he said, don\u2019t talk to me about that, that's nonsense, it\u2019s not scientific. He was correct that there's no scientific definition of it. But it's not nonsense, because it's actually the most important issue. Blake Lemoine, who says he worked in your lab at Google, contends that the LLM you were working on, LaMDA, was conscious. Was he wrong? I\u2019ve never called him wrong. I think he loves language models. You could consider them conscious\u2014I think they're not quite there yet. But they will be there. It's really a matter of your philosophical point of view, whether they're conscious or not. We will get to the point\u2014and this is not 100 years from now, it's like a few years\u2014where they will act and respond just the way humans do. And if you say that they're not conscious, you'd have to say humans aren't conscious. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Julian Chokkattu What have you been doing at Google? It\u2019s always been a bit mysterious. It started when I had a conversation with Bill Gates. He had read my book How to Create a Mind and wanted to actually create that in a computer. But I had just started a company two weeks earlier. Then [Google\u2019s ex-CEO] Larry Page was interested in the company, and we did a deal wtih Google to buy it. So I came here and started a group called Descartes. We did a lot of work that eventually became part of large language models. Maybe seven years ago, we trained a model to read 200,000 books and answer any questions. It got to a point where I was supervising around 40 people. That involved a lot of bureaucracy. My boss said, \u201cWhat you would really like to do is come up with ideas.\u201d So I'm now advising on AI\u2014providing my ideas to the CEO and other people. My views are taken more seriously because things I've said in the past have come true. You mentioned earlier that we will be able to upload our brains to a machine and have a backup version of ourselves. That creation could be our replicant, and stand in for us if we die. I find it disturbing to have more than one of me. The real you is a function of your physical brain as well as your electronic brain. This is just a copy of that. What's wrong with having a copy? Conceivably, you could churn out many copies. Then it\u2019s a race to get home first to see which version of you has dinner with your spouse. Yeah, there will be issues you have to deal with. I don't have all the answers. This is where Daniel Kahneman comes in. In your book you describe conversations you two had about a transition between our world and the singularity. You thought that society would be able to handle the transition, but Kahneman argued that it would be full of tumult, even violence. Yeah, he thought there'd be conflict. I was more optimistic. I'm not saying that everything's going to be perfect, but would you want to go back to, say, several hundred years ago, when our lifespan was around 30? When we had no electronics at all, and no one could remember anything, and we hadn't invented the record player? Life was pretty terrible. We\u2019re much happier now. And I've got 50 different graphs that show everything has gotten better. People don't remember that. I'm worried that we're going back to a more dangerous time, and AI in the hands of bad actors might make it worse. In your book you concede that AI might wreak more havoc than World War II. Yes, I talk about the perils. But I think they\u2019re unlikely. People who are negative about AI say that we have no way of dealing with these issues. Well, that's because we haven't had to deal with them yet. We will have the added intelligence to think about avoiding the perils. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Julian Chokkattu You put a stake in the ground with your book The Singularity Is Near. This one is called The Singularity Is Nearer. How do you define the singularity? To me it\u2019s when a human will not only be able to do everything that other people can do, but also create something new, like curing certain forms of cancer. AI is integral to doing that, because you can actually try out every single possible combination of things that might cure cancer. And instead of asking which one of those billions of possible cures are we going to try, we can try them all, and we can simulate them in a few days. The singularity is when we can actually combine that kind of thinking with our normal thinking, and we will then become superhuman. If we get to that point where we\u2019re all merged with superintelligent systems, will there still be huge personal fortunes, or will income inequality be mitigated at that point? What's the difference between, say, us and billionaires? They can sell companies and so on. But in terms of our ability to enjoy the fruits of life, it's pretty much the same. More than half the people in the United States can\u2019t come up with $500 for an emergency. Are you confident that the social safety net, and universal basic income and programs like that, will equally share this promised abundance? The safety net has expanded enormously. It's hundreds of programs. And it's going to keep doing that. Is that guaranteed? No. It depends on decisions that we make, and what kind of political systems we deploy. Once we get to AGI, computers will be able to do anything, including cleaning the dishes and coming up with poetry\u2014anything you say, these machines can do. Your views strike me as Panglossian. Do you feel that humans are essentially good? Yes. Out of all of this turmoil, we've gotten technology, which never would have happened without brains combined with opposable thumbs. Good things happen. You could argue that we're destroying the planet. Well, no. Within 10 years we\u2019ll come up with renewable energy that doesn't produce carbon dioxide. Look, we\u2019re going through a very big change. People\u2014not just scientists and philosophers\u2014are asking, \u201cHow are we going to handle this?\u201d I think those changes will continue to be positive. We don\u2019t have to worry about it. Vernor Vinge, who first fleshed out the singularity concept, also died recently. Were you in touch with him? I was in touch with him along the way. I think the last time was probably 10 years ago. How old was he? I think he was in his eighties. [Kurzweil reaches for his phone.] Yeah, check that part of your brain. [Looking at the screen] OK, he was born in \u201944. just died in \u201924. Seventy-nine. It\u2019s fairly young.

He says the real threat is misinformation.","date":"2024-06-14T15:00:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Jason Parham Phil Lewis never planned on leaving Michigan. Detroit was home. Still, he wasn\u2019t exactly happy with the life he\u2019d built, he tells me recently over Zoom. After graduating from Michigan State University, where he studied sociology, Lewis cycled through Teach for America and landed a gig as an elementary school educator, teaching seventh-grade history and social studies. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cI was kind of devastated a little bit because I just didn\u2019t really know what I was supposed to be doing,\u201d he says. This was around 2015, a bellwether year in digital media. Everything about the news industry was evolving at a volatile speed, as sites like BuzzFeed and Gawker chased virality, and legacy publications tried to keep stride. By that point, Twitter was the front page of the internet. Grassroots movements spurred by political and economic corruption\u2014the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter\u2014had recast the platform into ground zero for breaking news. Social media was ushering in a new age of citizen journalism. Lewis, with his 30,000 followers, decided to jump in. \u201cVine was still a thing. Influencing was a relatively new concept. I was a teacher with a decent following. A friend of mine was like, \u2018You should get into social media.\u2019\u201d That was almost a decade ago. Today, Lewis is behind one of the most popular\u2014and most reliable\u2014news accounts on X. He also landed a more traditional media gig, as a front page editor for HuffPost. Lewis has a sixth sense for news, and has made himself into an indispensable voice on an app that, these days, is drowning in noise (having 409,000 followers doesn\u2019t hurt either). He did so by sticking to a particular formula: platforming overlooked and underrepresented stories with more context, humanness, and understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring attention to everything because there\u2019s so much engagement bait online now,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWhat I try to avoid doing is lighting something on fire.\u201d In 2022, following Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter, and its subsequent rebranding as X, users furiously debated the platform\u2019s demise, and many wondered how apocalyptic its loss would be for independent and nontraditional media. Twitter was the internet\u2019s newspaper\u2014who would fill that void if it was suddenly gone? What wasn\u2019t up for debate was Lewis\u2019s impact. \u201cYou know where Black people on here get their news???? This guy,\u201d @solomonmissouri tweeted, referencing his account. Added @AkanButNoJeezyy: \u201cAnd @Phil_Lewis_ does not miss, okay?! One time for the Black Anderson Cooper.\u201d Their point being: Who tells your story matters. It is a lesson Lewis has never lost sight of. Jason Parham: Is it still possible\u2014in 2024\u2014to achieve the kind of career and presence you have online? Phil Lewis: It\u2019d be really hard. I wasn\u2019t competing with so many different voices. I think [journalist] Taylor Lorenz coined this term, but newsfluencers weren\u2019t a thing back then. At least in my mind, it wasn\u2019t. But now there\u2019s all sorts of people who do it or want to do it. My trajectory also coincided with the rise of digital news outlets. I rose with that. HuffPost and BuzzFeed had been around, but people were trying to figure out what it meant to find news and to surface news on social media. Today, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible, but it would be very difficult to go from a middle school teacher to working as a front-page editor at a news outlet where I have created my own lane. We\u2019re competing with so many eyeballs. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Is that how you see yourself\u2014as a newsfluencer? I\u2019m a journalist first, but there are people who fall under that category. Influencers aren\u2019t a bad thing, necessarily. I know there\u2019s a lot of debate around it. But there are people who have leaned into the news as part of their brand and what they do. People thought that\u2019s what I was. I actually found out that a lot of people didn\u2019t even know that I was a journalist until relatively recently. They thought I was, and this is a quote, \u201cSome dude sharing news stories online.\u201d For the longest time I thought you were a bot. A lot of people thought I was a bot. Or that I was just scheduling posts. And now I feel I can\u2019t change my profile picture. People might think I got hacked. Is the attention economy so fucked now beyond the point of saving that it\u2019s impossible to break through the chatter in a meaningful way? When you think about it, we\u2019re competing with Instagram aggregators, blogs, social media pages focused solely on news, podcasts\u2014it\u2019s all over the place. I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a bad thing. If it wasn\u2019t for social media, I would not have been able to take the path I did. We are in a crisis of attention, but what I find more frightening is the rise of misinformation and disinformation. That\u2019s more chilling to me than the amount of people who want to do the best work that they can, whether that\u2019s on YouTube or TikTok. There\u2019s more than enough happening out there for us all to get a piece or whatever. True. I\u2019m more concerned about the bad actors who are going after people who may not be reading the link. They might just be reading the headline, right? They might just be looking at the post with the black font that says, hey, this is what's happening on Instagram, and that\u2019s it. Because the state of news media has gotten so splintered, is this why you do what you do? I want to be able to be a resource for people online as far as getting them the information that they need. I mean, I love when people come up to me and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey, you know, I found out about this through you.\u201d I love hearing that because I do think there's so much out there that there\u2019s an equal amount of things that are being missed or underreported or that maybe people aren\u2019t paying attention to. The reach you have is pretty incredible. What I like most about whenever I\u2019m sharing a story, I know that it\u2019s not just readers who are at work who, you know, just opened up their phone and were like, \u201cOh wow, I found out about this story.\u201d It's also assignment editors who follow me. People at The New York Times, at CNN\u2014 \u2014at BuzzFeed. I bet they regret rejecting you now [laughs]. It\u2019s funny because people will tell me, \u201cHey, we shared your tweet in our newsroom Slack channel. That\u2019s how we found out about the story, and now we\u2019re going to write about it.\u201d So you don\u2019t have to have millions of followers, but I have a reach that\u2019s a little different. And that\u2019s important to me. \u201cWe are in a crisis of attention, but what I find more frightening is the rise of misinformation and disinformation.\u201d It should be. That\u2019s not to say I always get everything right. I always tell people, journalists get things wrong. We issue corrections. We try our best to do what we can. But what\u2019s most important to me is making sure that the stories that I think people need to know about or need to read about, I try to get them out there\u2014and apparently my Twitter page is the best way to do it. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy There is a reason people call you the Anderson Cooper of Black Twitter. There are too many nicknames. There was a Twitter thread with a bunch of different nicknames. It\u2019s humbling. It\u2019s nice to see that people care about what you\u2019re doing. But it also reminds me of how important it is\u2014especially for our community, the Black community\u2014to get these stories out and to make sure our stories are told and represented, and that people know about them. And not just get them out, but get them out correctly. Exactly. This week the Pew Research Center released a study stating that many Black Americans are distrustful of US institutions because they believe they are being conspired against. The same is true of news media. But a lot of people online trust you as a news source, which feels increasingly rare these days. And you know what, they\u2019re not wrong [laughs]. I\u2019ve been reading about media reparations. In the 1960s, the Kansas City Star totally ignored what was going on with the Civil Rights Movement and other things that were happening in the Black community. So they relied on Black newsrooms, the Kansas City Sun being one of them, to get them the news that they cared about. Obviously when we\u2019re talking about news deserts, Black communities are completely parched. What\u2019s the quote? When white America gets a cold, Black Americans get the flu. That\u2019s doubly true for Black media and Black newsrooms. Whenever I look at layoff numbers, these giant losses that have happened in traditional and local media, Black newsrooms are disappearing at greater rates to their white counterparts. Sometimes I feel like the state of the industry is like trying to solve a riddle that can\u2019t be solved, or doesn\u2019t want to be solved\u2014because, let\u2019s be real, that\u2019s a different discussion in itself. How can Black people better trust the news when we aren\u2019t being staffed, or saved from layoffs, in newsrooms? Right. It creates a fractured news economy where instead of going to MSNBC or The Washington Post for information, people start to source their news from social media accounts that don\u2019t always paint the full picture or even an accurate one. It is getting harder and harder. But I do know a lot of people who rely on accounts like The Shade Room or The Spiritual World for news. A friend recently sent me a news clip from TSW. I had never heard of it until then. And that\u2019s just it! These platforms reach people that HuffPost would never ever be able to reach. They reach people that WIRED would never be able to reach. Never. So when you think about it from a media strategy, especially if you work in public relations, to me this makes sense because you want to get your story out to as many people as possible. I know that The Shade Room has put money into reporting. They want to do things outside of just clipping videos. They are trying to hire editors. The important thing is to try to meet people where they are at. That\u2019s what I try to do. Gen Z and younger millennials\u2014they're online and they\u2019re on TikTok, they\u2019re on Instagram, they\u2019re right where these social media pages are. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy What\u2019s your temperature on the state of Black media today? I\u2019m under no illusion that it\u2019s not rough. It\u2019s definitely rough. What I would like to see are Black-owned, worker-owned outlets in the same vein as Hellgate and Defector. We haven\u2019t really gotten into that space yet. That\u2019s still a very, very white space. I think they would admit that too. They are doing some great work, and I wonder what that would look like for us. Is that what the future of news looks like? I think a piece of it looks like that. Journalism isn\u2019t going anywhere. I know people say journalism is dying, but people will always want to know what\u2019s going on. The industry\u2019s been dying ever since I started out over a decade ago. People say that, but it\u2019s just evolving. Your mileage may vary on how you feel about it. It\u2019s always changing. It looks different today than it did yesterday. People seem more interested in brands and people now, and they might not be watching network TV as much, but they are on TikTok way more. Or maybe they are getting all their news from Instagram. It\u2019s evolving in different ways. But yeah, what we are seeing now is just a piece of it, I think. And it\u2019ll keep changing. What\u2019s the hardest part about your job? [Long pause] The pressure of it. If you get something wrong when there are a lot of people relying on you\u2014 Four-hundred thousand people. But it\u2019s actually more than that because of the way news spreads. I end up on the For You page a lot\u2014and unfortunately with a lot of other, right-wing, big engagement folk. I think Twitter looks at me as a power user. I\u2019m not afraid of being wrong or getting something wrong, because that comes with the job, but there\u2019s still pressure. The thing is, if I share a story and it\u2019s totally wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t write it, people are gonna be like, OK, well, you shared it, right? It\u2019s probably good that you don\u2019t check your mentions, then. Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t check my mentions a lot, because it\u2019s mostly people fighting all day.

This week, developer Colossal Order fixed the problem by doing something real cities can\u2019t: removing landlords.","date":"2024-06-14T17:45:27Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Megan Farokhmanesh The rent is too damn high, even in video games. For months, players of Colossal Order\u2019s 2023 city-building sim, Cities: Skylines II, have been battling with exorbitant housing costs. Subreddits filled with users frustrated that the cost of living was too high in their burgeoning metropolises and complained there was no way to fix it. This week, the developer finally announced a solution: tossing the game\u2019s landlords to the curb. \u201cFirst of all, we removed the virtual landlord so a building\u2019s upkeep is now paid equally by all renters,\u201d the developer posted in a blog on the game\u2019s Steam page. \u201cSecond, we changed the way rent is calculated.\u201d Now, Colossal Order says, it will be based on a household\u2019s income: \u201cEven if they currently don\u2019t have enough money in their balance to pay rent, they won\u2019t complain and will instead spend less money on resource consumption.\u201d The rent problem in the city sim is almost a little too on-the-nose. Over the lpast few years, real-world rents have skyrocketed\u2014in some cases, rising faster than wages. In cities like New York, advocates and tenants alike are fighting against the fees making housing less and less affordable; in the UK, rent is almost 10 percent higher than it was a year ago. From Hawaii to Berlin the cost of living is exorbitant. Landlords aren\u2019t always to blame, but for renters they\u2019re often the easiest targets. From this perspective, perhaps Cities\u2019 simulator is too good. Prior to this week\u2019s fix, players found themselves getting tripped up on some of the same problems government officials and city planners are facing. \u201cFor the love of god I can not fix high rent,\u201d wrote one player in April. \u201cAnything I do re-zone, de-zone, more jobs, less jobs, taxes high or low, wait time in game. Increased education, decreased education. City services does nothing. It seems anything I try does nothing.\u201d On the game\u2019s subreddit, players have also criticized \u201chow the game's logic around \u2018high rent\u2019 contrasts reality,\u201d with one player conceding that centralized locations with amenities will inevitably have higher land values. \u201cBut this game makes the assumption of a hyper-capitalist hellscape where all land is owned by speculative rent-seeking landlord classes who automatically make every effort to make people homeless over provisioning housing as it is needed,\u201d the player continued. \u201cIn the real world, socialised housing can exist centrally.\u201d This is true. It exists in Vienna, which The New York Times last year dubbed \u201ca renters\u2019 utopia.\u201d Except, in Vienna the landlord is the city itself (it owns about 220,000 apartments). In Cities: Skylines II, the devs just got rid of landlords completely. The change in-game will have \u201ca transition period as the simulation adapts to the changes,\u201d Colossal Order says in its blog, and the developer says it \u201ccan\u2019t make any guarantees\u201d with how it will impact games with mods. Although the update aims to fix most of the problems at hand, that doesn\u2019t mean players should never expect to see rent complaints again. When household incomes are too low to pay, tenants will be loud about it. \u201cOnly when their income is too low to be able to pay rent will they complain about \u2018High Rent\u2019 and look for cheaper housing or move out of the city.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s time players had a few in-game tenant groups of their own.

But users don\u2019t always find it helpful.","date":"2024-06-14T09:00:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Paresh Dave For years Paula Thompson, vice president of client strategy at the US digital ad agency Optimal, has been helping Plunge sell baths to soak in chilling water by buying ads on Google search and Microsoft Bing. The ads appear atop results for searches such as \u201cice bath\u201d and invite users to \u201cBuy our cold plunge today\u201d or \u201cExperience the cold plunge difference.\u201d But as Microsoft put an AI spin on its search engine, the tub maker\u2019s ads on Bing now invite users to \u201clearn about the benefits of cold plunging\u201d or \u201clearn about the exclusive benefits of Plunge,\u201d according to Thompson. They direct to informational material, not the purchase pages that were mainly pushed before. This new tactic is one of the first examples of how the debut over the past year of search chatbots such as Bing Copilot are affecting advertisers, whose decades of patronage have kept tools free for searchers. Last month, Google confirmed that it would join their ranks and soon test ads in its AI Overviews search feature\u2014prompting anxious ad buyers to study up on what\u2019s been happening with Copilot. There is a lot at stake: Google parent Alphabet generated $74 billion in profits last year, and Microsoft $83 billion, with significant (though unspecified) contributions from selling search ads. It\u2019s not certain that the companies can continue balancing the demands of advertisers with the desires of users in the newer AI search features. Already, WIRED, one ad buyer, and users on social media have experienced irrelevant and potentially deceptive ads in Bing\u2019s new technology. In WIRED\u2019s limited testing, ads in Copilot have felt incoherent. A prompt about ice baths brought up ads for backpacks, not for Plunge or its rivals. A request for weight-loss tips returned ads for fat-freezing belts, which weren\u2019t listed among the AI-synthesized suggestions. Others have reached similar conclusions, including a user who last year described on Reddit seeing ads for dietary supplements not mentioned in an Copilot answer about burnout at work. Kya Sainsbury-Carter, corporate vice president of Microsoft Advertising, told WIRED in an interview that ads \u201care meant to be highly relevant, and so that's probably something we want to take a look at.\u201d But James Murray, senior product marketing manager for advertising, later added in an email that seeing ads for products not mentioned in a Copilot response is normal. Traditionally, searchers receive ads based on the keywords they enter into the search bar. Copilot ads are driven not only by search terms, Murray says. They also could be tied to questions a user asked earlier in a conversation with the chatbot, prompts that Microsoft auto-generates behind the scenes to engineer a better answer from Copilot, and the AI-generated response itself. While the ads are always meant to be relevant, serendipity is part of Microsoft\u2019s aim. Someone may search for \u201cbest ultra-HD, 8K QLED 80-inch TV,\u201d but to help them explore a range of options, Microsoft will show ads for a TV that is 85 inches or has an OLED screen. \u201cEven when users ask for something extremely specific, they still often click on ads for something that they didn\u2019t ask for,\u201d Murray says. (Google\u2019s ads are meant to be relevant to the query and the AI response.) By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Disclosure of ads has been an issue on Copilot as well. Though Microsoft says it labels all ads, Marcus Pratt, senior vice president for insights and technology at the ad-buying agency Mediasmith, says he\u2019s encountered at least two searches in which links with indications that they are sponsored arguably haven\u2019t been adequately disclosed. Last week, Pratt looked up the best reels to wind up and store his garden hose. Copilot recommended eight options, all apparently lifted from an article from the reviews publication Spruce, which links to Amazon product listings and gets a commission when readers make a purchase. When clicking on the reels in Copilot, he ended up on giraffetools.com, with code in the URL suggesting it had been a sponsored link. But an \u201cAd\u201d label is only visible if a user hovers over the link for a moment before clicking. Spruce and Giraffe Tools didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. In the other search, Copilot recommended a Nike Pegasus running shoe, but when hovering over the name, Microsoft showed a link to the shoe brand On with a small \u201cAd\u201d label in the corner. A link to a Women\u2019s Health article with more details about the Nike pair is below the ad. Pratt calls it a potentially dissatisfying experience for brands and a confusing one for consumers. \u201cThis blending of organic recommendations and sponsored listings is blurring the lines more than I have seen in the past,\u201d he says. Nike, On, and Women\u2019s Health didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Microsoft\u2019s Sainsbury-Carter says ad experiences may vary as Microsoft continues testing and applying feedback. Despite optimism among investors in the tech giants\u2019 abilities to smooth out the rough edges and keep sales flowing, mixing AI-generated content into search is the industry\u2019s biggest shift since the advent of smartphones. Google is trying to quickly satisfy people\u2019s curiosity by using AI Overviews\u2019 generative AI to summarize the web, which users have panned for embarrassing gaffes like suggesting they squeeze glue on pizza. Microsoft is not only publishing similar AI summaries, but also enabling users to explore topics by conversing with Copilot, the AI chatbot from Bing. Though Google has tested ads in a precursor to AI Overviews, Microsoft is so far ahead\u2014displaying more ads and disclosing more about how they are doing. In a webinar for select ad agencies last week seen by WIRED, Microsoft\u2019s Murray said that users click on ads in Copilot at nearly twice the rate they do for equivalent ads when they\u2019re shown as the first ad above traditional search results, which historically is the most clicked ad. They also prefer a Copilot experience with ads than without by a slim margin. Sainsbury-Carter says to her, the data mean users are finding Copilot ads more integral than tacky. She adds that clicks on multimedia ads, specifically, were three times higher in Copilot than elsewhere in Bing between last July and this past January. The company declined to share specific figures but described the measure as statistically significant. Advertisers don\u2019t have much choice about investing in AI search. Microsoft and Google are pulling from customers\u2019 existing ad campaigns for other environments to fill the ad slots in Copilot and Overviews until more data is gathered on their effectiveness. That means Copilot can draw on advertisers\u2019 content to show ads as simple text, a row of product images, sponsored links embedded within AI summarization, or multimedia widgets for booking travel or deciding which car to buy. \u201cWe're still in a place where we don't feel like asking advertisers to adopt, launch, manage, and optimize an entirely new campaign type,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Sainsbury-Carter says. \u201cCertainly that could happen over time if it feels like it's really bifurcating and the differences are great enough.\u201d By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Fortunately for Microsoft, she says, advertiser requests to opt out of AI-focused ads and complaints about ads appearing beside inaccurate AI-generated copy have both been minimal. Microsoft is being \u201csuper measured\u201d about how many ads are shown in the new features, Sainsbury-Carter says, declining to provide specific figures. Microsoft and Google also have not told advertisers exactly when their ads have appeared in AI features, limiting their ability to measure the payoff compared to traditional search ads. And the companies haven\u2019t shared many tips on crafting ads for the new search features, according to four ad agencies\u2019 executives, including Thompson. Sainsbury-Carter says the core message to advertisers is that optimizing for ads on Bing in general does the trick. Thompson, whose agency also represents Microsoft\u2019s Azure Cloud business, has crafted her own theory about how to adapt: Instead of targeting people who search for a specific product, advertisers need to educate people who have never heard of the product in the first place, since it seems people often turn to Copilot with broad questions. Rather than targeting just short phrases like \u201ccold plunge,\u201d Plunge now tries to run Bing ads on longer queries such as \u201cHow to cold plunge,\u201d \u201cWhere do I put cold plunge,\u201d and \u201cWhat is the optimal temperature for a cold plunge.\u201d (As low as 37 degrees Fahrenheit, Thompson says.) Thompson believes that the strategy is helping because clicks are up on her clients\u2019 Bing ads, though the search engine\u2019s growth to 140 million daily users from 100 million a year ago also could be a factor. She gains additional comfort from Google\u2019s statement at its big annual advertising conference last month that users find ads in the new experiences less gimmicky. But it\u2019s hardly definitive. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough transparency yet,\u201d she says. There\u2019s little doubt, though, that Microsoft views Copilot as essential to the feature of search. Heavy promotion and integration certainly contributed to the number of Bing searches that involved at least some use of Copilot growing four times faster over the past year than traditional searches alone, according to the company, which declined to share specific figures. Those using Copilot in some way during the second half of last year seemed to get to their answers quicker, shaving 12 percent off their searching time and increasing their ad clicks by 30 percent. That puts greater pressure on advertisers to perfect their messages and Microsoft\u2019s algorithms to deliver them on the appropriate queries. About four out of every five ad clicks in Copilot during testing throughout last year came from chats lasting less than a minute, Sainsbury-Carter says. Advertisers and consumers had better get used to it, because ads are poised to spread to additional AI-heavy services. Snapchat, Chinese tech giant Baidu, and German newspaper Bild all signed up to use Microsoft technology to serve ads in their chatbots. Snap spokesperson Ahrim Nam says the partnership has graduated past the testing phase, but declines to further comment. Baidu declined to comment, and Bild didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Microsoft works with over 1,500 publishers, so ads could come to more chatbots as the trend of adding AI conversational tools to apps and websites grows. It will have some competition. OpenAds, a New York City startup that\u2019s raised $1 million in funding, expects its ad technology to launch inside multiple AI search chatbots and image generators in the next couple of months, its CEO, Steven Liss, says. Liss took on the challenge of developing the service in part because Google, the dominant provider of ad technology on the web, currently refuses to serve ads on webpages and apps \u201cwhere dynamic content (e.g., live chats, instant messaging, auto-refreshing comments, etc.) is the primary focus of the page.\u201d Even if Google updates its policy, Liss says OpenAds can survive bigger players by designing more engaging ads. For now, Microsoft enjoys the rare advantage of being in the lead. But the contribution from Copilot and the other AI features to Microsoft\u2019s $18 billion in annual ads sales is unclear, and Sainsbury-Carter declines to disclose the prices the new ads are fetching. \u201cWe think this can be a really interesting business over time, but we think it's an interesting business if we are surfacing personalized ads that people love and find joy from and that are super, super useful,\u201d she says. It\u2019ll also require them to keep plunging into the depths of trusting AI with their queries.

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Eric Ravenscraft Planning your lighting for a photo or video shoot can be complicated, and the terminology used to measure light in lighting equipment can make things even more confusing. When shopping online, most lights list \u201clumens\u201d or \u201clux\u201d among their technical specs, though sometimes \u201clumens\u201d is written as \u201cluminous flux.\u201d You might even get tripped up on luminance versus illuminance. It\u2019s a lot. So let\u2019s break it all down. One thing to note: You\u2019ve probably seen light bulbs with output measured in watts; LED bulbs often say something like \u201c60W equivalent.\u201d However, watts are a measure of how much power a light bulb uses, not how much light it puts out. This metric is a holdover from when incandescent lights were commonplace and used significantly more energy than today\u2019s LEDs. However, as more energy-efficient lights have grown in popularity, it\u2019s no longer useful to use watts as a shorthand for how much light a bulb puts out (it wasn\u2019t super useful to begin with). This is why you\u2019ll see terms like lumens or lux on professional lighting gear. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. The first term you should get to know is lumens. The amount of visible light that a source puts out is referred to as luminous flux and the lumen is a unit of measurement for that raw output. You can think of this as how \u201cdistance\u201d refers to how far apart two places are, while \u201ckilometers\u201d is the unit used to measure that distance. Lumens in the kilometers in that analogy. Stinson Carter Stinson Carter Julian Chokkattu This can be a little confusing because companies will list \u201cluminous flux\u201d without naming the unit of measurement. For example, one of our favorite lights for shooting professional videos, the Godox SL-60W, lists its luminous flux as 4,500 in its description. Using our metaphor above, this is like saying \u201cDistance: 4,500\u201d without listing what unit that number refers to. That said, while they\u2019re not interchangeable, if you see \u201cluminous flux\u201d listed on a product spec sheet, it\u2019s probably referring to lumens. However, this does make it important to double-check that you\u2019re comparing comparable numbers when shopping for lights from different manufacturers. You might also see this metric as \u201cluminance,\u201d which is another, less common way to refer to a light source\u2019s output. And, like \u201cluminous flux,\u201d it's a general term for the concept, not a unit of measurement. However, this is distinct from illuminance, which refers to reflected light, not the light coming directly from a source. And yes, it\u2019s confusing. How much light a source puts out is only part of the story. After all, the sun puts out enough energy to melt \u2026 basically everything. Fortunately, the sun has a good sense of personal space and stays far enough away from the Earth to not destroy us all. For similar, less catastrophic reasons, factoring in how far away your light source sits affects the kind of light you\u2019ll need. Lux is defined as one lumen per square meter, though the math can get tricky because we\u2019re dealing with surface areas in three dimensions. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to sweat it too much. Most professional lighting will simply list their output in lux (as well as lumens), and specify a distance. For example, the Aputure Amaran P60X is rated for 5,070 lux at 1 meter. This means a subject 1 meter from the light source will effectively perceive a little more than 5,000 lumens of light on them. If they\u2019re farther away, less of the light from the source will hit them, and thus the subject will appear dimmer. This is helpful when shopping for a light because you might not need the brightest lights in the world. You only need to ensure the subject is the right distance away from the light source. Figuring out the right distance for a light source isn\u2019t exactly intuitive, because of two major factors: The first is the inverse square law, one of those weird quirks of the universe that we have to deal with. Put very simply (mathematicians, please don\u2019t yell at me), every time you double the distance between the subject and the light source, you quadruple how much light is needed to light them the same way. In other words, it means that every time you move twice as far away from a light source, only one-fourth of the light from that source will hit your subject. So, using the Amaran P60X above as an example, if it\u2019s rated for 5,070 lux at 1 meter, then the subject will experience around 1,267 lux at 2 meters. Some lights will specify their lux at shorter distances, like 0.5 meters, which makes it crucial to make sure you\u2019re comparing equivalent specs when looking at lights from different manufacturers. By Martin Cizmar By Scott Gilbertson By Eric Ravenscraft By Louryn Strampe The other major factor to consider is the light\u2019s beam angle. Most professional lights will allow you to shape the light with accessories like reflector dishes. Light sources emit light in all directions, but you can reflect some of that light to point toward your subject, which can increase how much of the luminous flux lands where you want it to (and, in doing so, increase the lux on your subject). The beam angle measures the width of the cone of light coming from your light source. A wider beam angle means light is dispersed over more of an area. A narrower beam angle focuses light on a smaller area. Some lights will come with accessories to help you shape the light. You don\u2019t always need the brightest light in the world\u2014you just need to get the right amount of light onto your subject. That might mean more raw lumens, but it could also mean using reflectors, barn doors, or bounce boards to reflect the light you have to where it needs to go. The math might be a little intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, lighting a scene gets a lot easier. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Amanda Hoover Many burned-out workers have likely dreamed of hiring a career coach or r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writer. Now, LinkedIn is introducing chats with generative AI career experts based on real people. Other new AI tools within the platform will help people write r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters or evaluate their qualifications for jobs posted. LinkedIn has ramped up its generative AI tools in the past year and is moving to incorporate the tech into even more of its offerings. On Thursday, the career site announced new features like a pilot for AI-powered expert advice, an interactive chat to break down information in LinkedIn courses, and more AI features that can be used to search for and apply for jobs for its premium users in English. The changes showcase a massive push by LinkedIn to capitalize on generative AI. (LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, which has invested heavily in OpenAI, which in turn is powering the platform\u2019s AI offerings.) And as LinkedIn continues its drive to become more than just a job site, people may spend their time there socializing or learning new skills through video courses. The idea behind some of these AI tools is both for people to grow their skills and to apply to more jobs that closely fit their experience, rather than blasting out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s en masse. \u201cWe expect that you will find the most relevant job faster\u201d using AI, says Gyanda Sachdeva, vice president of product at LinkedIn. LinkedIn\u2019s AI chatbots will allow premium subscribers to ask career questions like, \u201cHow can I negotiate my salary?\u201d The chatbots are trained on the coursework of real-life coaches, who are paid by LinkedIn to repackage their content. Among them are AI versions of Anil Gupta of the University of Maryland, psychologist and author Gemma Leigh Roberts, and career coach Lisa Gates. Last fall, LinkedIn added AI tools for recruiters to use conversational language to search for job candidates. And earlier this year, the company began rolling out generative AI tools that allow job seekers to open a chat window on job descriptions to ask if they might be a good fit for an open position. In turn, they receive AI-generated feedback about ways their skills and experience align well, or if there are other skills they should add to their profiles to stand out. LinkedIn is now enhancing some of these features. Premium users can begin their job search with a conversational inquiry, like \u201cFind me an engineering job in Texas that pays at least $110,000.\u201d They can then use generative AI to write cover letters and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, tailoring them to specific jobs, in addition to using it for messaging hiring managers or searching for work. WIRED tested the cover-letter-writing feature, and found that the tool was able to synthesize a reporter\u2019s experience listed on LinkedIn and a job posting in a coherent way, but some more editing may be needed to really make the letter stand out with direct examples of past work. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter writing tools were highly requested by people who had been using other LinkedIn AI products, says Sachdeva. \u201cWhenever you apply to a job, it's going to be a different r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a different cover letter. And the AI can help you do that.\u201d AI tools are becoming more common in both the job hunt and on the hiring side. There are AI interviewers, as well as AI tools to sift through job applicants, and AI tools to help people bulk-apply for jobs. But there are signs that some of the tech can be biased, and little is known about what drives algorithms to make choices about who is hired. It\u2019s still early to tell what impact LinkedIn\u2019s new AI-driven features will have on the workforce at large. Rohan Rajiv, LinkedIn\u2019s director of product management, said during an announcement of the new tools that AI can help recruiters to find \u201chidden gems,\u201d or candidates that may not communicate in ways that have traditionally caught recruiters\u2019 attention. But further building generative AI into job platforms like LinkedIn raises questions: Will AI help historically underrepresented job candidates enhance their profiles and applications to land jobs, or will it repeat past biases in hiring?

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Steven Levy While companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others had been upfront about their efforts in AI, for years Apple had been silent. Now, finally, its executives were talking. I got an advance look one day. Eager to shed the the impression that the most innovative of the tech giants was a laggard in this vital technology moment, its software leader Craig Federighi, services czar Eddie Cue, and top researchers argued that Apple had been a leader in AI for years but just didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. Advanced machine learning was already deep in some of its products, and we could expect more, including advances in Siri. And since Apple valued data security more than competitors, its AI efforts would be distinguished by exacting privacy standards. How many people are working on AI at Apple, I asked. \u201cA lot,\u201d Federighi told me. Another executive emphasized that while AI could be transformative, Apple wanted nothing to do with the woo-woo aspects that excited some in the field, including the pursuit of superintelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s a technique that will ultimately be a very Apple way of doing things,\u201d said one executive. That conversation took place eight years ago, when the technology du jour was deep learning AI. But a year after that, a groundbreaking advance called Transformers led to a new wave of smart software called generative AI, which powered OpenAI\u2019s groundbreaking ChatGPT. In an instant, people started judging tech companies by how aggressively they jumped on the trend. OpenAI\u2019s rivals were quick to act. Apple, not so much. Many of its best AI scientists had been working on self-driving cars or its expensive mixed-reality Vision Pro headset. In the last year or so, Apple pulled its talent from such projects\u2014no more autonomous cars\u2014and instead came up with its own gen-AI strategy. And at this week\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple revealed what it was up to. Uncharacteristically, for such an event, the news was less about products than Apple\u2019s declaration that when it comes to gen AI, we\u2019re on it. In an interview after the keynote, CEO Tim Cook explained the anomaly. \u201cIt became clear that people wanted to know our views of generative AI in particular,\u201d he said. But just as in 2016, there was a cautionary note: While the company would now embrace generative AI, it would do it in a very Apple way. The company refused to even label its technology as artificial intelligence. Instead, it coined the phrase Apple Intelligence, a made-up technical name whose purpose seems to distance Apple from the scary aspects of this powerful tech wave. Apple isn\u2019t interested in pursuing the singularity or making the movie Her come to life. It\u2019s using this new tool to enhance productivity and creativity, and just as with past intimidating technologies, Apple-izing AI will make it go down easy. The approach is well timed. I date the age of generative AI from the November 2022 release of ChatGPT. We spent all of 2023 trying to absorb what it meant, and a lot of people are now experiencing a rejection impulse. They\u2019re repelled by AI\u2019s hallucinations and angry at the prospect of lost jobs. And most people still haven\u2019t figured out what AI can actually do for them. In 2024, smart companies have been concentrating on how this jaw-dropping technology can actually be put to use in prosaic scenarios. Apple proclaimed, \u201cAI for the rest of us.\u201d (The one time the letters \u201cAI\u201d were used in the keynote.) It was a conscious invocation of the original Macintosh slogan. Presumably, Apple will spread AI to the masses in the same way it promulgated the graphical user interface with the Mac. In contrast to that great ambition, the products Apple touted during the keynote weren\u2019t exactly revolutionary. A lot of the the demos involved summarizing, transcribing, auto-completing emails, organizing inboxes, writing paragraphs from prompts, and zapping photo-bombers from images. Those are table stakes for the gen-AI era. Apple\u2019s pitch, as always, is that it will offer these advances organically woven into your normal workflow so you\u2019ll actually use those features and be delighted by them. Apple has also come up with some nice twists in these products. Its Photos app promises a deeper search capability, using AI to figure out what a picture shows and who\u2019s in it to search for specific images from vague prompts. In automatically generated email replies, Apple could ask you in certain cases a simple question, answerable by a single click\u2014do you actually want to meet this person and when?\u2014and then spin off a response that reflects your intent. More significantly, because users in Apple\u2019s ecosystem have a wealth of personal information on their phones and computers, Apple\u2019s AI can use that data to deliver relevant output while keeping those details onboard the devices, protecting users\u2019 privacy. Apple SVP Federighi\u2014still on the case\u2014describes it as \u201cintelligence that understands you.\u201d (Apple even claims it will use outside investigators to verify that the data is indeed secure.) The most interesting of the Apple announcements involved its AI assistant, Siri, which has been looking like an antique in the age of generative AI. Apple promised that in the future\u2014maybe 2025?\u2014Siri would not only become a better conversationalist but also could be a uniquely powerful personal assistant by performing complex requests involving multiple apps. Ironically, this was the vision of the original Siri team in 2011, overruled by Steve Jobs in the pursuit of simplicity\u2014and because the underlying technology just wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cThis is the exact missing link from the original Siri,\u201d says Dag Kittlaus, who was in charge of that team when Apple launched the product. Kittlaus and some key colleagues later attempted to fulfill the vision with a startup called Viv, which now lives on as a Samsung product called Bixby. In order for a complex system like this to work, it\u2019s imperative to get a critical mass of developers to sign on. The WWDC program included sessions that instructed developers how to make their apps work with Siri. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy Apple Intelligence might prove to be a disruptive and scary force no matter how benignly it\u2019s packaged. If Apple does pull off its vision for Siri\u2014something where a single command might allow a computer to knock off tasks that otherwise would take hours or days to complete\u2014an avalanche of unintended consequences might ensue. Even knowing your preferences, how will Siri make its choices? Will it put you in a middle seat when it books a flight for you because it\u2019s figured out you\u2019re frugal\u2013even though you\u2019d gladly pay an extra $11 to sit on the aisle? When you ask it to catch up on headlines, will it cater to your biases? No matter what Apple calls it, AI is going to change the way we do things. At WWDC this week, Apple promised to be part of the transformation. In 2016 Apple picked me to reveal that, under the hood, its products were loaded with AI. In the age of generative AI, the company understood that it needed a more public declaration that it was now prioritizing the new technology. That was the theme of the 2024 WWDC. But a lot of the issues\u2014privacy, control, and what goes into training sets\u2014are the same as they were eight years ago. While it\u2019s clear that machine learning has changed Apple\u2019s products, what is not so clear is whether it is changing Apple itself. In a sense, the machine learning mindset seems at odds with the Apple ethos. Apple is a company that carefully controls the user experience, down to the sensors that measure swipes. Everything is pre-designed and precisely coded. But when engineers use machine learning, they must step back and let the software itself discover solutions. Can Apple adjust to the modern reality that machine learning systems can themselves have a hand in product design? By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy \u201cIt\u2019s a source of a lot of internal debate,\u201d says Federighi. \u201cWe are used to delivering a very well-thought-out, curated experience where we control all the dimensions of how the system is going to interact with the user. When you start training a system based on large data sets of human behavior, [the results that emerge] aren\u2019t necessarily what an Apple designer specified. They are what emerged from the data.\u201d Apple isn\u2019t turning back, says [SVP Phil] Schiller. \u201cWhile these techniques absolutely affect how you design something, at the end of the day we are using them because they enable us to deliver a higher quality product.\u201d Fred asks, \u201cDo you believe in life after apps?\u201d Thanks, Fred. If I may parse your question, I intuit you are asking whether something lurks beyond the current paradigm of computing, where an operating system hosts a suite of applications where the actual working, playing, and socializing occur. If this did happen, it would be a seismic change in the digital world. But once again, the adherents of generative AI are offering an alternative. Instead of opening an app, you\u2019d simply say what you want to a smart assistant and\u2014poof!\u2014it will be done. There\u2019s a lot that would have to happen for that vision to materialize. The entire software infrastructure is now centered on an app-style economy. And AI is just not good enough to do everything as neatly as apps do. On the other hand, picture a successful execution of what Apple wants to do with Siri. You might give it a complicated list of things to accomplish on a shopping trip, and one thing might include getting from one place to another. Apple could access the inner workings of a car service like Uber or Lyft, and everything you do within that app could be done by Siri. You\u2019d still be taking an Uber, but the app would disappear. By Mark Harris By Christopher Solomon By David Gilbert By Steven Levy For now though, there\u2019s plenty of life in apps. Especially if they are powered by AI.

Florida\u2014the state that bans mentions of climate change in its laws\u2014breaks more records in rainfall and flooding. Everything that Apple rolled out at WWDC.

How does it work?","date":"2024-06-14T12:00:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Reece Rogers If you\u2019ve ever used a generative artificial intelligence tool, it has lied to you. Probably multiple times. These recurring fabrications are often called AI hallucinations, and developers are feverishly working to make generative AI tools more reliable by reining in these unfortunate fibs. One of the most popular approaches to reducing AI hallucinations\u2014and one that is quickly growing more popular in Silicon Valley\u2014is called retrieval augmented generation. The RAG process is quite complicated, but on a basic level it augments your prompts by gathering info from a custom database, and then the large language model generates an answer based on that data. For example, a company could upload all of its HR policies and benefits to a RAG database and have the AI chatbot just focus on answers that can be found in those documents. So, how is this process different from a standard ChatGPT output? I asked Pablo Arredondo, a vice president of\u00a0CoCounsel\u00a0at Thomson Reuters, who has been using the RAG method to develop aspects\u00a0an AI tool for legal professionals. \u201cRather than just answering based on the memories encoded during the initial training of the model,\u201d he says, \u201cyou utilize the search engine to pull in real documents\u2014whether it's case law, articles, or whatever you want\u2014and then anchor the response of the model to those documents.\u201d For instance, we could upload the entirety of WIRED\u2019s history, all of the print magazines and web articles since 1993, to a private database and build a RAG implementation that references these documents when answering reader questions. By giving the AI tool a narrow focus as well as quality information, the RAG-supplemented chatbot would be more adept than a general purpose chatbot at answering questions about WIRED and relevant topics. Would it still make mistakes and sometimes misinterpret the data? Absolutely. But the odds of it fabricating entire articles that never existed would definitely go down. \u201cYou're rewarding it, in the way that you train the model, to try to write something where every factual claim can be attributed back to a source,\u201d says Patrick Lewis, an AI modeling lead at Cohere who helped develop the concept of RAG a few years ago. If you teach the model to effectively sort through the provided data and use citations in every output, then the AI tool is less likely to make egregious mistakes. Though, exactly how much RAG reduces AI hallucinations is a point of contention for researchers and developers. Lewis carefully chose his words during our conversation, describing RAG outputs as \u201clow hallucination\u201d rather than hallucination-free. The process is definitely not some panacea that eliminates every mistake made by AI. During conversations with multiple experts, it became clear that just how much RAG lowers hallucinations depends on two core things: the quality of the overall RAG implementation, and how you decide to define AI hallucinations, a sometimes fuzzy term without a firm definition. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu To start off, not all RAGs are of the same caliber. The accuracy of the content in the custom database is critical for solid outputs, but that isn\u2019t the only variable. \u201cIt's not just the quality of the content itself,\u201d says Joel Hron, a global head of AI at Thomson Reuters. \u201cIt's the quality of the search, and retrieval of the right content based on the question.\u201d Mastering each step in the process is critical since one misstep can throw the model completely off. \u201cAny lawyer who's ever tried to use a natural language search within one of the research engines will see that there are often instances where semantic similarity leads you to completely irrelevant materials,\u201d says Daniel Ho, a Stanford professor and senior fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered AI. Ho\u2019s research into AI legal tools that rely on RAG found a higher rate of mistakes in outputs than the companies building the models found. Which brings us to the thorniest question in the discussion: How do you define hallucinations within a RAG implementation? Is it only when the chatbot generates a citation-less output and makes up information? Is it also when the tool may overlook relevant data or misinterpret aspects of a citation? According to Lewis, hallucinations in a RAG system boil down to whether the output is consistent with what\u2019s found by the model during data retrieval. Though, the Stanford research into AI tools for lawyers broadens this definition a bit by examining whether the output is grounded in the provided data as well as whether it\u2019s factually correct\u2014a high bar for legal professionals who are often parsing complicated cases and navigating complex hierarchies of precedent. While a RAG system attuned to legal issues is clearly better at answering questions on case law than OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini, it can still overlook the finer details and make random mistakes. All of the AI experts I spoke with emphasized the continued need for thoughtful, human interaction throughout the process to double check citations and verify the overall accuracy of the results. Law is an area where there\u2019s a lot of activity around RAG-based AI tools, but the process\u2019s potential is not limited to a single white-collar job. \u201cTake any profession or any business. You need to get answers that are anchored on real documents,\u201d says Arredondo. \u201cSo, I think RAG is going to become the staple that is used across basically every professional application, at least in the near to mid-term.\u201d Risk-averse executives seem excited about the prospect of using AI tools to better understand their proprietary data without having to upload sensitive info to a standard, public chatbot. It\u2019s critical, though, for users to understand the limitations of these tools, and for AI-focused companies to refrain from overpromising the accuracy of their answers. Anyone using an AI tool should still avoid trusting the output entirely, and they should approach its answers with a healthy sense of skepticism even if the answer is improved through RAG. \u201cHallucinations are here to stay,\u201d says Ho. \u201cWe do not yet have ready ways to really eliminate hallucinations.\u201d Even when RAG reduces the prevalence of errors, human judgment reigns paramount. And that\u2019s no lie. Don\u2019t think breakdancing is an Olympic sport?

The web giant then used some of Artifact's AI smarts to supercharge its own mobile news app.","date":"2024-06-13T13:00:00Z","content":"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Boone Ashworth Today Yahoo is debuting a revamped version of its news app. This new Yahoo News app, which is available as a free download now, is powered by the underlying code of the well-received yet short-lived app Artifact. And of course, the new app is infused with AI capabilities to surface the news articles that might interest you most. Artifact was a news reader app that launched in 2023 and was helmed by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It made heavy use of AI, employing algorithms to process user behavior and serve readers highly personalized content based on which news stories they engaged with. A little more than a year after it started, the Artifact team shut down the service after it became clear it wasn\u2019t growing enough. Though the app may have floundered, its resurrection was swift. In April, Yahoo announced it had bought Artifact with the goal of bringing Yahoo users \u201cmore content tailored to their interests.\u201d Just a little more than two months later, that plan has emerged in the form of the revamped Yahoo News app. Yahoo News is gigantic. It\u2019s the biggest news platform in the US, with more than 185 million monthly visitors. Now, Yahoo hopes to use the machine intelligence engine behind Artifact to revitalize its app by sharpening its powers of personalization, a move that could help Yahoo hop headfirst into the AI scrum. The new Yahoo News app is free (though ad-supported), available on iOS and Android, and can be used with or without a Yahoo account. This AI push for the News app comes a few days after Yahoo introduced AI updates to its Mail app. Yahoo is also adding generative AI summaries of news articles. In the new app, users will see a prompt in some stories to generate \u201cKey Takeaways.\u201d After tapping the prompt, users will see a quick summary load after a second or two of computation. The AI summaries appear in the desktop version of Yahoo News too, but only for a small subset of users who are selected and then choose to opt in. The recommendation features enabled by the Artifact-driven algorithms in the Yahoo News app are only mobile for now. They aren\u2019t powering the desktop version of Yahoo News yet, but Yahoo says the goal is to eventually synchronize features across all platforms. Kat Downs Mulder, senior vice president and general manager of Yahoo News, says the update is a \u201ccomplete top to bottom redesign of our Yahoo News app.\u201d Even at first glance, the difference is immediately noticeable. The app looks slick and uncluttered, and it\u2019s simple to navigate. And behind the scenes, there\u2019s a variety of AI algorithms pulling strings to show you what you want to see. Some of these features are powered by proprietary technology, and some are powered by the AI bigwigs Yahoo has partnered with, like OpenAI. By Christopher Solomon By Julian Chokkattu By  Nena Farrell  By Julian Chokkattu The actual articles displayed in the app are curated from news websites and are available without paywalls or subscription requirements. (Yahoo News partners with more than 1,000 publishers, who get paid based on revenue sharing agreements. It\u2019s kind of like Spotify, but for news.) Getting started requires minimal effort. When you launch it, the app asks you to pick five or more news topics you\u2019re interested in, like politics, science, gaming, and climate. From there, a combination of algorithmic curation and some human finagling from people in an editorial role at Yahoo News determine what you see. Additional customization options let you block individual publications or keywords if you don\u2019t ever want to see them in your feed again. (Something like \u201cElon,\u201d for example.) Downs Mulder says what you see in the new Yahoo News app is the result of a careful balance of AI and editorial decisionmaking. It\u2019s tailored to your interests, while also showing a Top Stories section that displays what Yahoo considers the most important stories of the day. Those are decided on via a symbiotic process where AI flags stories that seem to have more heft or user interest, and people in editorial roles at Yahoo News decide to include the stories that seem most important. The team also wants to keep the app from being annoying, and Yahoo says it\u2019s intentional about which notifications you get pestered with. \u201cPeople want places to spend their time that are going to help them save time and get what they want to get done, done,\u201d Downs Mulder says. \u201cAnd in this case, that\u2019s getting informed, having things to talk about.\u201d Still, the main problems with recommendation algorithms that aggressively track user behavior and promote news stories with high engagement is that they often reinforce bias and can lead to the spread of misinformation. If you can select exactly what news sources and what types of stories you want delivered to you, there\u2019s a risk that you\u2019ll get locked into an echo chamber. Downs Mulder says Yahoo is trying to very carefully walk that ethical tightrope of delivering what users want to read without causing troublesome side effects. \u201cI really like the way this app has come together, because it does balance that Top Stories with that \u2018for you\u2019 in a way that\u2019s going to provide you that awareness of what I need to know and what I want to know,\u201d Downs Mulder says. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to keep a reader from getting too far down a rabbit hole.\u201d Another one of Artifact\u2019s bias-combating features that shows up in the redesign is the ability for clickbait headlines to get rewritten on the fly. Users who see a headline that feels like clickbait can flag it, and once enough people have reported it, the headline will be replaced in the app with a clearer, often more direct rewrite. The new headlines are composed by the generative AI engine and fine-tuned by Yahoo\u2019s human news curators. To keep people clicking, the Yahoo News app also includes an element of gamification, where the app tracks how many articles you read and bestows fun titles upon you to mark your level of effort. Read enough stories and you\u2019ll get rewarded with a badge. For example, reading one story gets you the Learner title, while going up to 250 reads labels you a Sage, which Yahoo says labels you \u201cone of the top readers on Yahoo News\u201d within the app. The Artifact-ification of the News app might also pave the way for future features across Yahoo. Downs Mulder envisions a future where those reading badges pay off in a more finite way. If someone is classified as a Sage, they might be treated as having more authority or credibility within the broader Yahoo community. Some former Artifact features haven\u2019t quite made their way into the new Yahoo News. The pre-Yahoo version of Artifact included a feature that used AI voices to read articles aloud, including AI-generated voices that sounded like rapper Snoop Dogg and not-rapper Gwyneth Paltrow, among others. That option isn\u2019t in Yahoo News yet, though when asked about it, Downs Mulder says more features are coming to the Yahoo News app in the near future, and some of them will be along those lines. \u201cI would just encourage you to stay tuned,\u201d she says.

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It\u2019s the law.   Edited by Nadia Ragozhina and Emily Atkinson All times stated are UK Emily Atkinson Live reporter That's it from us. It's been a slower Saturday on the campaign trail, but there was still plenty to keep us busy. We'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning for more, but in the meantime there's plenty on offer across the BBC to keep you going: Today's page was brought to you by Nadia Ragozhina, Ali Abbas Ahmadi and me. It's been a slower than usual Saturday of campaigning as the UK prepares for a general election.  We are about to close this page, so here's a reminder of what's been happening today:  Let's return to the Labour campaign for a moment and hear from the shadow health secretary who's been speaking to the BBC about Labour's plan for the NHS.  During a visit to a hospital in Nottinghamshire earlier, Wes Streeting says that if the NHS continued to function as it has under Rishi Sunak, waiting lists \"could do as high as 10 m\".  For context: Waiting lists in England have fallen from their peak last September, but are still higher than when Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to cut them, in January 2023. After falling from a peak of 7.8m in September, the number rose slightly again this week. Streeting says the last Labour government delivered the lowest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction. \"We did it before, and with the country's permission, we can do it again,\" he adds. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue points out that the last Labour government increased spending on the NHS by 7% each year, and asks whether a new Labour government would do the same. Streeting says that the public finances are in \"a real state\" after 14 years of Tory governments, and says that the Labour manifesto is \"a fully costed and fully funded plan\". This\nmorning, Fraser Nelson, the editor of the Spectator magazine, accused the\nConservative Party of thinking it had \"the licence to lie\" over its\ntax attacks on Labour. For context: This was in reference to the Tory campaign's repeated claim that Labour would raise taxes by \u00a32,000 per working household if it formed the next government. BBC Verify has analysed the Conservatives' \u00a32,000 tax claims and concluded that they risked misleading people. Nelson has frequently challenged the Tories' claim on social media about the tax claim. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's strange. [The Conservatives] seem to think they've got a licence to lie during election campaigns. Political adverts aren't regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority, so you can say things there that would get you prosecuted.\" I don't know if they expect tribalism from journalists on the right - but journalists are going to point out untruths when they're seen. Suffice to say it didn't go down very well.\" Sir Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak of \"deliberately\" lying about Labour's plans, adding that he would not bring in tax rises for working people. In an interview for ITV's Tonight programme, recorded on Thursday, Rishi Sunak replied \"no\" when asked by presenter Paul Brand if he was \"willing to lie in order to stay in power\". Today, in this podcast recorded live on BBC Radio 4, our Electioncast colleagues look at warnings from Defence Secretary Grant Shapps about a big Labour\nmajority.  Adam Fleming, Laura Kuenssberg and Paddy O\u2019Connell also look at Reform UK - one poll put the party a point ahead of the Tories for the first time.  For context: Polling ahead of the Tories doesn't mean Reform UK is about to get lots of MPs, as our Political Editor Chris Mason explains here. Hannah Miller Political correspondent Asked about the rise of Reform UK earlier today, Veterans' Minister Johnny Mercer\nsays people are fed up of \u201cpoliticians making commitments that are not\nfulfilled in a way that they would like to see\u201d. Labour would point out that it is the Conservatives who have been\nin power for 14 years and not fulfilling some of their commitments. Lack of\ntrust is a problem Keir Starmer has acknowledged, promising to restore faith in\npolitics. But through the campaign Starmer has at times struggled to\nanswer directly uncomfortable questions about tax - constrained by the economic\nrealities he is likely to inherit, and the deluge of negative headlines that\nwould inevitably ensue if he did. Nigel Farage faces no such constraints, having never had to deliver\nin government. His continuing presence on the UK political scene could prove a\nchallenge for all politicians. Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of being \"intent on destroying\" the Conservative Party.  In an interview with the Times, he says: \u201cI want to be as sure as we can that we get no Reform members of parliament and the Conservative Party can move forward.\u201d Asked about comments Farage made to the paper, when he said Rishi Sunak \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand our culture\u201d, Cameron says: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch sheep dog trials to hear a dog whistle.\" Elsewhere, former home secretary Suella Braverman uses a Telegraph interview to restate her view that Farage could be welcomed back into the Tory fold \"if he was supporting the Conservatives and wanted the Conservatives to win\". Farage has now responded, writing on X: \"On the same day that Suella Braverman says she wants me in the Tory party, David Cameron is abusive about me.  \"Sums them up.\" Remember, you need to register to vote by Tuesday 18 June and it only takes about five\nminutes online.  If you can\u2019t vote in person, then there are separate deadlines\nto apply for a postal vote and a proxy vote. You need to register to vote and then submit a postal vote application by 17:00 on Wednesday 19 June. Plus, you\u2019ll need photo ID at the\npolling station. If you don\u2019t have one of the accepted forms of ID already, the\ndeadline to apply for a free Voter Authority Certificate is Wednesday 26 June.   If you want to apply for a proxy vote (when someone votes on your behalf) the deadline is also 17:00 on Wednesday 26 June. You can find further details on how to register to vote here.  Hannah Miller Political correspondent Capital gains is a tax you pay when you sell an asset which has\ngone up in value. You don\u2019t pay it on your main home, as long as you\u2019ve always lived\nthere - but the Conservatives had been claiming that might change under Labour. Today, Keir Starmer explicitly ruled it out - he said it was never\nthe party\u2019s policy and he can \u201cabsolutely\u201d guarantee it won\u2019t happen over the\nnext parliament. Labour have previously ruled out increasing the rates of income\ntax, VAT, and national insurance - but they\u2019ve often been reluctant to respond\ndirectly on other taxes. The Conservatives have been using it as one of their main lines of\nattack \u2013 you might have heard them saying that Labour is going to \u2018tax your\nhome\u2019. This is a clear attempt to shut that down. Gary O'Donoghue Reporting from the Labour campaign This\nvisit to a hospital was all about Labour's promises on the NHS. But\nafter several days of being asked about whether Labour would rule out putting\ncapital gains tax on the sale of primary residences, we finally got an answer. Keir\nStarmer told us: \u201cIt was never our policy. I'm happy to rule it out.\u201d For the\nwhole of the next Parliament I asked? Yes, he said. It\nbegs the question why he and his team let the Conservatives run with this one\nfor the past week or so; the problem now of course is that the Tories have 17\nother potential taxes Labour hasn't explicitly ruled out and they will\nundoubtedly keep asking about them as well. Gary O'Donoghue Reporting from the Labour campaign I\u2019ve\nnever before heard a hospital ward referred to as an F1 pitstop; but that's how\none of the nurses showing Sir Keir Starmer round described Bassetlaw hospital\u2019s\northopaedic unit. It\nspecialises in elective procedures, but in the evenings and at weekends the\noperating theatre we were shown into is quiet \u2013 not enough staff to keep this\nshiny new facility running and bringing down those waiting lists. That's\nLabour's promise: to get units like this running for longer each week, paying\novertime to staff to get more procedures done. But\nwith NHS staff often reporting just how worn out they feel, Labour doesn't\nreally have an answer to how it will make sure units like this one are busy all\nday every day. Hannah Miller Political correspondent The election campaign is only halfway, but for the Conservative\nParty some soul-searching has already begun. With Reform UK seeing a steady increase in their polling, there is\ngeneral agreement that the failure to bring down migration more quickly is\nresponsible for much of Nigel Farage\u2019s appeal. But what to do about him is less clear. Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, certainly no friend of Farage,\nhas urged the party to reject his \u201cinflammatory\u201d rhetoric on migration, and\ninstead adopt \u201crobust policy and measured language.\u201d But earlier in the week Suella Braverman said she would be willing\nto \u201cwelcome\u201d him into the party. If the Conservatives thought leaving the EU was going to put an end\nto the divisive impact Farage tends to have on their party, there is a\nstrong suggestion that may not be the case. Let's move away from the Lib Dems, and it's another day off the campaign trail for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. At the end of last week he was attending the G7 summit in Italy. The PM is currently watching the Trooping the Colour parade, alongside his wife Akshata Murthy. (You can follow live updates from those events here.) But that's not all. This afternoon, Sunak is expected to attend the Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland.  Jenny Hill Reporting from the Lib Dem campaign The sign read \u2018No adults on the jumping pillow\u2019 (it\u2019s a bit\nlike a bouncy castle without the walls) but they made an exception for the\ncampaigning Lib Dem leader and his local candidate.  There were the inevitable quips about creating a bounce in\nthe polls as Ed Davey and Chris Coghlan leapt and slipped about to the laughter\nof watching families. He brushed off questions about Reform\u2019s current position in\nthe polls, saying that the Lib Dems shared no values with Nigel Farage\u2019s\nmovement, adding that his was the only party demanding real political\nchange.  Davey has also been highlighting what the Lib Dems are calling a \"car theft epidemic\" in the UK. His party is pledging to scrap elected police and crime commissioners (PCC) to unlock what they say will be an addition \u00a3170m to bolster frontline policing.  Speaking to the BBC, he says that \"only the Liberal Democrats\" are showing how frontline policing would be improved we do it \"by getting rid of these PCCs\". The party's own analysis of Home Office data found 360,072 unsolved car thefts in England and Wales since the last election. Liberal Democrat analysts claimed there was a 42% rise in unsolved car thefts between 2020 and last year - from 76,333 to 108,934. More now from Ed Davey, this time on immigration. He tells the BBC that there is a need to \"take immigration seriously\" and to \"stop the boats coming across the channel\". The Lib Dem leader then accuses the Tories of having \"failed miserably on all these fronts\",  saying they weren't prepared to work internationally, with European partners and others, to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has congratulated Alan Bates - the former sub-postmaster who successfully campaigned to highlight the Post Office Horizon scandal - on his knighthood. Speaking while out on the campaign trail in Surrey, he tells the BBC that Bates \"fought the system, sometimes singlehandedly, he fought it bravely, and he won\". Asked he if would apologise to sub-postmasters, Davey - who was minister responsible for the Post Office between 2010 and 2012 - says he had apologised for not meeting Bates on his request three weeks after he took office. He adds that he was later the first minister too meet Bates, and that he put his questions to officials and the Post Office. Davey also says he's \"looking forward\" to attending the Post Office inquiry on 18 July.  Andrew Kerr Political correspondent, BBC Scotland A cheery Kate Forbes has been on the campaign trail for\nthe SNP as an overall mood of despondency hangs over Scotland. Political differences were set aside for the big game\nlast night but - despite the result - electioneering begins again in earnest. Forbes is the deputy first minister in the SNP-led\nScottish government. This morning she visited a huge Scottish transport hub in\nLarkhall, South Lanarkshire. It handles the vast majority of Scottish salmon. The party\u2019s ABC message has been clear in this campaign -\nfocusing on austerity, Brexit and the cost of living. Today was B - Brexit. Forbes railed against the UK\u2019s\ndeparture from the EU and about the trade barriers that have gone up. She claims only with independence could Scotland re-join\nthe EU and that SNP MPs would work to protect the food and drink industry here\nand cut Brexit red tape. More now from Johnny Mercer's interview with the BBC - this time on immigration. Mercer acknowledges that his party \u201chaven\u2019t got there fast enough\u201d on bringing\ndown small boat arrivals, though points to the fact that the number of people\narriving by small boat went down by a third last year. For context: More recent figures\nsuggest that the number of people arriving in small boats so far in 2024 are\nhigher than in the previous four years.  Speaking\ngenerally about immigration, he says: \u201cGovernment\u2019s a fight, anything in\ngovernment is difficult and we\u2019re on that trajectory and you can see from the prime minister\u2019s record over the last six to twelve months that we\u2019re making\nprogress. \"But I get people\u2019s frustration, they don\u2019t see it straightaway, I\nshare that frustration.\u201d  Veterans' Minister Johnny Mercer says that Reform UK is rising in the polls because people are \u201cfrustrated\u201d with politicians.  Speaking to the BBC, he says Reform's momentum is down to \"a frustration with politics right, and politicians making commitments that are not fulfilled in a way that they would like to see them fulfilled,\" noting immigration as one example. Asked whether it's his party\u2019s fault that people are frustrated after 14 years of Conservative government, Mercer says it's \u201ceverybody\u2019s fault\u201d, before turning to criticise the Labour Party, accusing them of \u201ctreating people with a lack of respect\u201d.  He also adds that said a vote for Reform would lead to a Labour government and that would be \u201ca disaster\u201d for the country.       The next UK general election will take place on 4 July.   How do people say they will vote in the UK general election?

Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the most significant philosophers of the twentieth century, Philippa Foot (1920 - 2010). Her central question was, \u201cWhy be moral?\u201d Drawing on Aristotle and Aquinas, Foot spent her life working through her instinct that there was something lacking in the prevailing philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s which held that values could only be subjective. Could there really be no objective response to the horrors of the concentration camps that she had seen on newsreels, no way of saying that such acts were morally wrong? Foot developed an ethics based on virtues, in which humans needed virtues to flourish as surely as plants needed light and water. While working through her ideas she explored applied ethics and the difference between doing something and letting it happen, an idea she illustrated with what became The Trolley Problem.

The singer, 65, has been appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity. Le Bon studied drama at university in Birmingham, where Duran Duran was formed. The singer, who was born in Hertfordshire and grew up in Pinner, west London, said: \"What an incredible and totally unexpected honour.\" Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978 Le Bon said the last few years had been \"some of the most important\" in Duran Duran's career. \"It is fitting that the honour has been awarded not just for my role in music, but also for the work I've been fortunate to be involved with outside the band for some of the causes I believe in,\" he said. \"To name but two of them, I hope this moment helps to raise awareness for the Blue Marine Foundation and the importance of their conservation work, and for Centrepoint.\" Pop-rock band Duran Duran formed in 1978 in Birmingham, with Le Bon auditioning to be part of the group two years later. The band's self-titled debut album was released in 1981, with the group achieving 30 top 40 singles in the UK over the past five decades. Le Bon has three children with his wife, model Yasmin Le Bon, whom he married in Oxford in 1985. Duran Duran, which features keyboardist Nick Rhodes, bassist John Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, received a lifetime achievement award in 2011 at the GQ Men Of The Year awards.

In the latest in a series of BBC Panorama interviews with the party leaders, the Labour leader denied wanting to wave a \"magic wand\" to prevent either tax rises or public spending cuts, to deliver on his election promises. Sir Keir also told Nick Robinson he was \"not hostile\" to people who used private healthcare, and ruled out rejoining the European Union. Meanwhile, speaking to journalists at the G7 summit in Italy, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was \"going to fight for every single vote until the last day\". Asked why he thought opinion polls were suggesting some Conservative voters were turning to Reform UK, Mr Sunak said \"we're only halfway through this campaign\".  He also repeated his insistence that \"the Conservatives had a \"tax-cutting manifesto\" whereas Labour was \"going to put your taxes up\". Earlier this week at Labour's manifesto launch, Sir Keir said his was the party of economic growth and would boost wealth creation. Nick Robinson suggested the party was trying to disguise an \u00a318bn hole in Treasury funds - equivalent to 10% of the NHS budget - which would need to be filled either by tax rises or spending cuts to public services. However, Sir Keir said he rejected the choice was simply being \"boxed in\" between tax and spend because there was another lever, which he said was growth. \"My manifesto is about wealth creation,\" he said. \"This is a party of wealth creation, of growth.  \"Therefore this boxing in that everybody is trying to do... that the only levers available to a Labour government or a Labour prime minister is to put up tax or pull down spending - I reject that - growth is the lever that I intend to pull.\" Asked if he was trying to \"wave the magic wand of growth\", Sir Keir said \"it's not a wand, it's a plan\" and outlined how Labour was focused on how to get rid of blocks to business needs that were preventing economic growth. The Labour leader gave the example of a wind turbine that could be built in two years but would instead be held up by the planning process for five years - suggesting he would be willing to override objections to new developments.  When Nick Robinson asked if he was prepared to make enemies in order to drive economic growth, Sir Keir replied: \"Yes - we're going to have to be tough.  \"We're going to have to change the way things are done.\" Following the first leaders' debate, where Sir Keir said he would not use private healthcare himself under any circumstances, Mr Robinson suggested there was some concern the Labour leader thought people who did were \"queue jumpers\". \"I'm not hostile in the slightest,\" Sir Keir said. \"I completely understand why people would go private... because they wanted to get an operation more quickly or get back to work or something else.\" But he defended the NHS as the best performer on acute care saying it was \"the very best place to be\" for the treatment of life-threatening illness, adding that private hospitals \"refer into the NHS for acute care\" for that reason. This video can not be played UK can do better than Johnson's 'botched' post-Brexit trade deal - Starmer On Brexit, Sir Keir was pressed on whether he wanted to re-join the European Union having campaigned for Remain and also calling for the option of a second referendum as Shadow Brexit Secretary, before ruling out a re-entry last year. The Labour leader ruled out re-joining, saying he respected the vote and that membership of the EU was \"not a silver bullet\".  The post-Brexit trade deals were \"botched\", he said, and Labour would negotiate a better Brexit trade deal if it wins 4 July's general election, but many issues around growth could be fixed without undoing Brexit.  \"I do think we can do better than the botched deal that we've got under Boris Johnson,\" he said. \"I think every business thinks that.\"  He added: \"If you look at the problems for growth over the last 14 years, they were there, or many of them were there, before Brexit, so the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept.\" At the G7, Mr Sunak said there was a clear choice between the two parties and he would \"continue fighting very hard to make sure everyone understands the choice that's ahead of them\". He claimed that electing Labour would give Sir Keir \"a blank cheque\" to hike taxes, whereas, if the Tories were re-elected, \"we will be able to cut taxes for people at every stage of their lives\".  Turning to the single opinion poll which put Reform ahead of the Conservatives, the Prime Minister said the only poll that mattered was the one on July 4th. Other opinion polls have put the Tories ahead of Nigel Farage's party.   Mr Sunak also pledged to stay on as an MP for a full five-year parliamentary term even if the Conservatives lost on 4 July.

Kate Rackham was diagnosed with oestrogen-receptive breast cancer at the age of 39. The Manchester-based teacher, who shared updates on her life with her 17,000 followers on the X platform, helped set up the Fighting to be Heard charity to raise awareness of the condition and provide support for those with the condition. A post on the 46-year-old's account on Thursday read: \u201cIf you\u2019re reading this, it means I have died. But do not cry for me. I have lived my life on my own terms, the way I have wanted to.\u201d In her post, she said she had joined the social media platform \u201cbecause I needed an outlet\u201d but \u201cwhat I got was so much more\u201d. \u201cYou made me feel validated in my feelings and much less alone. Thank you.\u201d Former BBC newsreader Beccy Barr, who attended the same school and has been diagnosed with abdominal cancer, posted a tribute, saying: \u201cIn recent months we reconnected and she was incredibly empathic and supportive of my terminal diagnosis as she handled her own. What a wonderful woman.\u201d Nicola Nuttall, whose daughter Laura, 23, died of brain cancer while achieving a bucket list of ambitions, posted that she was \"heartbroken that we\u2019ve lost this truly incredible woman\". Speaking about climbing Pendle Hill with Ms Rackham, in memory of Laura, Nicola added: \"Kate really knew how to live, she wanted to come up Pendle but wouldn\u2019t wait for better weather because she knew better than anyone the value of a single day. \"We nearly got blown off but it was brilliant, so glad we met.\" Allow Twitter content?

She made a difference to the lives of so many people, both in her years in education and her inspirational awareness raising and charity work following her own cancer diagnosis. \"She will very much be missed in our school community and beyond. We are all blessed to have had Kate Rackham as part of our lives.\" Ms Rackham previously told BBC Radio 5 Live about her \u201cheartbreaking\u201d struggles with hair loss. \u201cIt's really hard losing your hair. It's not just losing your hair, it's losing your eyelashes and eyebrows as well. \u201cThat's the difference between looking like you are rocking a bald head and looking like you are on chemotherapy,\u201d she said. She said her diagnosis \"came as a massive shock\", and that prior to it, she had lumps that she had got checked out, but with no family history she was told not to worry. When she noticed another lump, she said she did not get it checked straight away. In her role as trustee of Fighting To Be Heard, Ms Rackham said her aim was \"to raise awareness in a bid that no one else goes through what we are all going through\".

Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was on a lorry in the convoy, also said that while waiting at a checkpoint he witnessed the fatal shooting of two Gazan fishermen. In their response, the Israel Defense Forces said documentation for the Unicef vehicle in the convoy was not filled out correctly and accused Mr Elder of presenting a \"partial picture\". Mr Elder said people had told him they would be \"happy if there is an air strike\" on their homes, to end their suffering. Unicef says it is seeing increasing malnutrition among children in Gaza In an interview with the BBC's Today programme, Mr Elder said: \u201cThey\u2019re so despairing, they\u2019re so broken, they\u2019ve lost so many family members, they have nothing left.\u201d He said the areas of Gaza being denied aid were suffering from levels of severe malnutrition unprecedented in Gaza. He added that doctors in Gaza had needed to be trained to deal with the most serious cases as they had not experienced them in the past. His remarks came after World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday that a significant proportion of Gaza's population were facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\". More than 8,000 children under five years old had been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition, of whom more than 1,500 had a more severe form, Dr Tedros added. More than 37,000 people have been killed, and many hundreds of thousands more injured or displaced in Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.  Israel and Hamas placed on UN list for violating children's rights Mass graves and body bags: al-Shifa hospital after Israel withdrew its forces 'Forced to speak in a whisper' - Hamas hostage's 'miracle' rescue Mr Elder described how on Wednesday he was travelling on a Unicef lorry in an aid convoy trying to get from southern to northern Gaza. He said that despite having all the necessary paperwork it took them 13 hours to travel about 40km (30 miles). After spending eight hours at checkpoints they were finally denied entry, he said, \"so 10,000 children who were going to benefit from nutritional supplies, medical supplies, did not\". Mr Elder said he did not know why the convoy was denied entry, but said such denials were \"consistent and relentless\" and that there were hundreds of examples. The IDF said in a statement that a problem arose because Unicef had used a lorry with a rear closed cabin which required prior coordination with the authorities, adding that Hamas frequently exploited closed cabins to smuggle weapons and terrorists into northern Gaza. It said Unicef had initially claimed the lorry did not include a closed cabin but this claim turned out to be false. \"Once the situation was clarified, [Unicef] was offered to continue its movement northward without the mentioned truck or to submit appropriate coordination for the following day,\" the IDF added. \"As long as the coordination process is properly conducted, passage will be allowed,\" the statement continued. Mr Elder also said that during the checkpoint wait he saw about eight fishermen trying to catch fish with a single net.  \"Suddenly we heard a tank coming down, we heard... automatic fire,\" he said. \"We saw two men on the beach, two fishermen fleeing, one was shot in the back, one in the neck.\" The Unicef spokesman said the WHO, who had paramedics in the convoy, called through to the IDF to be allowed to give the men medical support, but that support was denied. He said he was later able to see the fishermen's wounds when their colleagues were allowed to retrieve the bodies. The IDF said it was looking into what it described as the \"incident on the beach which was mentioned in the interview\".  Mr Elder, who was last in Gaza six weeks ago, said things were much worse now. \"It's the first time I've seen a real level of despondency,\" he said. \"It's very unsettling to see a child when their parent can't protect them, it's heartbreaking when a parent can't protect their child, so increasingly I'm hearing people say I just want this over, I'm happy if there's an air strike on me tonight.\" Speaking again to the BBC on Saturday, Mr Elder warned against the normalisation of this \"horror show on children\".  \"There is nothing normal about walking through this hospital, speaking to a mother as I did 10 minutes ago, who was asleep in her family home when a rocket hit. Next thing she's in the rubble three floors below, two of her children are killed and the third... has serious head injuries.\" Putin peace terms slammed at Ukraine summit Kate returns to public events at Trooping the Colour What does Nigel Farage really want?

The decision, which came two years after the court rescinded the nationwide guarantee to an abortion, was welcomed by pro-choice activists. The justices decided the plaintiffs, a group of anti-abortion doctors and activists, did not have a legal right to sue.  But they left the door open to other attempts to limit the availability of the drug. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, now the most common method of terminating pregnancies in the US.  The plaintiffs, known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, had argued that approval for the drug from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be withdrawn.  But during arguments on the case in March, several of the court's nine justices sounded sceptical that any of the plaintiffs had suffered harm from the availability of mifepristone - which is necessary to have the legal standing to sue.  \"The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological objections to elective abortion and to FDA's relaxed regulation,\" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh for the court, \"but they failed to demonstrate\" any actual injury.  \"A plaintiff\u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue,\"  he also wrote.  The top court overturned Roe v Wade, effectively rescinding a federal right to abortion, in June 2022. Since then, 21 states have moved to restrict abortion earlier in pregnancy than the standard it had set. Seventeen of those have barred the procedure at six weeks or earlier. Thursday's ruling has no bearing on these laws - medication abortion remains illegal in states that prohibit abortion. But abortion pills have acted as an effective workaround to the bans, with thousands of pills flowing into restrictive states through the mail.  Pro-choice activists were encouraged that access to abortion pills had been preserved, but warned the Supreme Court's decision was a qualified victory.  At least three states - Missouri, Kansas and Idaho - have also opposed the FDA's approval of the drug in court. The Supreme Court's decision on Thursday does not rule out these future challenges.  \"This ruling is not a \u2018win\u2019 for abortion, it just maintains the status quo,\" said Nancy Northup, president of the pro-choice Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement.  \"The attacks on abortion pills will not stop here - the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world.\" In a statement, President Joe Biden echoed those comments, saying the ruling \"does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues\". \"The stakes could not be higher for women across America,\" he said.  Anti-abortion groups criticised the decision. But these groups, too, indicated the fight would continue.   \"It is a sad day for all who value women\u2019s health and unborn children\u2019s lives,\" said Katie Daniel, state policy director for Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America.  \"But the fight to stop dangerous mail-order abortion drugs is not over.\" Abortion is expected to be a leading issue at the ballot box this autumn.  Since Roe v Wade was overturned, it has posed a problem for some Republicans, caught between a base that opposes the abortion, and a general electorate that broadly supports access to the procedure, external.  Anti-abortion movement stalls as election year looms How safe is the abortion pill mifepristone? This video can not be played Texas abortion law:  'I waited for my daughter to die so I wouldn't die' In recent months, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called for compromise from his party members, suggesting strict bans were politically costly.  On Thursday morning, speaking to House Republicans, Trump seemed to advocate for exceptions to anti-abortion laws, saying \"like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of the mother, rape and incest\". He added: \"But you have to follow your own heart.\"  The two-drug regimen was approved for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy by the FDA in 2000. A patient is first given mifepristone to induce an abortion and then misoprostol to empty the uterus. Since 2016, the FDA has eased access to the drug and allowed doctors to hold virtual appointments with patients and for prescriptions to be sent by mail. Those more recent approvals were at question in this case.  Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US now are medication abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports access to the procedure.  More than a million pregnancies were terminated in the US last year, the highest number in over a decade, says the institute. Throughout two decades of use, the FDA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and other mainstream medical organisations have maintained that both mifepristone and misoprostol are safe for women to use.  US studies say medication abortion is about 95% effective in ending pregnancy and requires further medical follow-up less than 1% of the time.

The court ruled by a 6-3 majority that the government did not have the right to ban the accessories. The Trump administration banned bump stocks after they were used in a shooting that killed 60 people at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017. But a Texas gun shop owner who challenged the ban said the government went too far in defining the accessories as machine guns, which are mostly illegal under federal law - with some exceptions - and took his fight all the way to America's highest court. US law prohibits the transfer or possession of machine guns made after 19 May 1986, the effective prohibition date. However, transfer or possession of machine guns lawfully obtained before that date is legal. The court said a semi-automatic rifle with an attachment does not qualify as a machine gun under federal law. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, written by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had \u201cexceeded\u201d its authority. The court, quoting part of the legal definition of machine guns, said rifles with a bump stock \"cannot fire more than one shot 'by a single function of the trigger', and even if they could, they would not do so 'automatically'\". What are bump stocks?  The split decision saw the three liberal justices on the conservative-dominated, nine-member court dissent: Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Sotomayor said: \"Today, the Court puts bump stocks back in civilian hands.\"  A decision which she said \"will have deadly consequences\".  On whether weapons with the accessory should qualify as machine guns, she said: \"When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.\"  In the 1986 Firearms Act, machine guns are defined as any \"weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\". During a hearing on the case in March, some justices on the conservative-led court  appeared sceptical of the ban, drawing attention to the minor technical differences of how a bump-stock gun fires compared to a machine gun.   At the time, Justice Neil Gorsuch said he could understand \u201cwhy these items should be made illegal\u201d, but said that doing so explicitly was Congress\u2019s role. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson countered, saying bump stocks are just \u201cthe kinds of weapons Congress was intending to bar because of the damage they do\u201d. The bump stock harnesses a rifle's recoil to rapidly fire multiple rounds. It replaces the weapon's stock, which is held against the shoulder, and allows the gun to slide back and forward between the user's shoulder and trigger finger. That motion - or bump - lets the gun fire without the user having to move their finger. The attacker in the Las Vegas shooting had attached bump stocks to 12 of his semi-automatic rifles which allowed him to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, the same rate as many machine guns. He killed 60 people and wounded hundreds more who had gathered for a music festival. A spokeswomen for Donald Trump's campaign, whose administration enacted the original ban,  told the BBC that \"the court has spoken and their decision should be respected\". A spokesman for President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to debate Trump on 27 June as the two candidates bid for re-election, criticised the decision. \u201cWeapons of war have no place on the streets of America,\" they said.

The gym in Incheon city near the capital Seoul put up a sign that read \"off limits to ajummas\" and \"only cultivated and elegant women allowed\". Ajumma is a catch-all term for older women - typically late-30s onwards - but is also a pejorative for behaviour that is seen as rude or obnoxious.  Local reports did not name the gym or its owner, who defended the move, claiming that his company had \"suffered damages\" because of these women and their unruly behaviour.  \u201c[Some older women customers] would spend an hour or two in the changing room to do their laundry, steal items including towels, soaps, or hair dryers,\u201d he said in a televised interview with South Korean news agency Yonhap. \u201cThey would sit in a row and comment and judge other people\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said, adding that some younger women have quit the gym because of these comments, which upset them or made them uncomfortable. While the move was made by a single gym, it seems to have struck a nerve because in recent years, South Korean businesses have drawn flak for banning children or seniors from certain public places.  Some of this has been seen as proof of growing intolerance for specific age groups. The gym has also drawn criticism for conflating bad behaviour with women of a certain age.  \u201cHow did the term 'bad customer' become the same as 'ajumma'?\", read one comment on local social media website instiz. \"If you have worked in the service industry, you\u2019d know that it\u2019s not just older women who fall into those categories.\u201d  Another comment described the move as a sign of outdated attitudes, calling it \"sentiments of the early 2000s\u201d.   Why women in Korea are reclaiming their short hair Why South Korean women aren't having babies The Korean women defying beauty standards The gym defended itself by pointing to an additional notice that tried to distinguish between ajummas and women. It says that ajummas tend to \"like free stuff regardless of their age\", and that they are \"stingy with their own money but not with other people's money\". The gym's owner also said there may be other business owners who share his sentiments but have not spoken out. \"It\u2019s not that I tried to make a hate comment against older women or women in general,\" he told Yonhap. \"I think people who are enraged by [the notice] are in fact the ones with the problem.\" The ban did find support among some people online, who also seemed to associate  ill manners with older or middle-aged women. Some described them as \"territorial\",  while others used insulting language, calling them \"senseless\".   \"The ladies are annoying... They take their kids to restaurants and cafes. They are oblivious and abusive,\" read one comment on YouTube.  There were multiple references to children, with the main notion being that these women took up a lot of space or attention in public spaces.  South Korean women have long fought for non-traditional choices - from short hair to singledom - in a society that holds them to often unyielding standards. Women say men are rarely judged for similar behaviour.   Commentators too have pointed out that there was no need to single out women at all, when older men are just as likely to behave badly.  \u201cOlder men behave the same,\" psychology professor Park Sang-hee said in an interview with television network JTBC, following the ban. \"Older men also obsess over free stuff and repeat themselves over and over again.

Karen Foster, 62, left Harlow Collinge with unsurvivable brain injuries after he had been dropped off at her home by his mother Gemma Collinge, the court heard. Harlow was taken to hospital from the address in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, on 1 March, 2022, but died four days later. Following sentencing, his family said they had lost their son \"in the most horrific of circumstances\". Karen Foster told a paramedic that Harlow had \"suddenly collapsed\" Foster was due to stand trial at Preston Crown Court for his murder last week but the prosecution accepted a plea of manslaughter. The basis of her plea was that her \"forceful shaking\" caused Harlow's death after he fell out of his high chair and began crying, the court heard. Foster, a registered childminder with nine years experience, called 999 to say he was not breathing, and told a paramedic he had \"suddenly collapsed\". After Harlow was rushed away by ambulance, Foster hugged his mother at the hospital and claimed the youngster had begun choking and that she had slapped him on the back. But she later tried to blame Ms Collinge for the injuries. Harlow died days later in his parents\u2019 arms having suffered massive brain injuries. Foster, despite claiming benefits for ill health, had been breaking Ofsted rules on the numbers and ages of children she should have been caring for, to make more money from parents, the court heard. Relatives of Harlow shouted \"scumbag\" and \"I hate you\" as Foster was led away from the dock after being sentenced by High Court judge Mr Justice Barry Cotter. The judge described Harlow as a \"happy, healthy, much-loved\" boy, but said that Foster, despite ill health and pain in her hip, chose to carry on looking after more children than she should have under Ofsted rules, and this had contributed to her \"loss of temper\". He said: \"I have no doubt you snapped on the 1st of March 2022, in part due to the fact that you were not coping with the demands of caring for four children.  \"You lost your temper and he was on the receiving end. \"You shook an (almost) 10-month-old child so violently to cause devastating injuries. His death was caused in the course of an assault.\" In a statement, Harlow's family said: \"We do not know where to begin explaining what it is like losing our son in the most horrific of circumstances. \"Our boy\u2019s life has been taken away by a horrible, fake individual, who we trusted and who promised to care for him. \"No words can describe how it has ruined our lives.\" Harlow's mother, father Allen Frangleton, older siblings and wider family, sat in the public gallery, weeping as Foster's case was heard and their victim impact statements were read out. Ms Collinge spoke of the \"guilt\" she felt, having made arrangements to move Harlow to a nursery six weeks after first using Foster as a childminder, due to her own concerns about the number of children being looked after. \"All the red flags I missed,\" she continued before recalling Foster trying to comfort her at the hospital, claiming Harlow had choked on pasta. This video can not be played Harlow Collinge's mother says son's death has 'ruined lives' She added: \"She even put her arms around me. I can't think of anything more evil. It is despicable. I blame myself every day for my son's death. This monster, Karen Foster, deserves nothing. I hope her actions haunt her.\"  Det Supt Allen Davies, of Lancashire Police, said: \u201cThe case of evidence proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Foster was solely responsible for Harlow\u2019s unlawful killing, meaning Foster finally admitted her guilt last week. \u201cMy thoughts remain with Harlow\u2019s family who have behaved with dignity while dealing with such an unimaginable and unexpected loss.\u201d Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Some 8,000 sq m of tunnels that run under High Holborn were built in 1942 as an air raid shelter to provide protection during the Blitz. Later, they were used as a home for the British spy organisation, the Special Operations Executive. The labyrinth, known as the Kingsway Tunnels, featured in the first James Bond novel. The tunnels have remained unused since they were decommissioned in 1990. The plans include an underground bar The plans were approved by the City of London Corporation on Tuesday, but Camden Council still has to approve them. A history and heritage section would \u201ccurate the history of the site through a historic timeline by displaying the retained and restored telecommunications equipment\". The plans also include educational facilities, exhibition spaces and an underground bar.  The submission notes the tunnels could also be used to host exhibitions on themes \"such as James Bond\". The space is expected to be able to accommodate hundreds of people at a time, leading to an estimated \u00a360-\u00a380m of additional expenditure in the area each year, according to those behind the project. Free visits are also to be offered to London schools, with a minimum of 40 children expected each week. Angus Murray, chief executive at the London Tunnels, described the proposal as \u201ca restoration of an existing asset\". He said there was a \"tremendous story\" to be told, including that of the London Blitz, adding that the project would deliver financial benefits and align with the City\u2019s local plans, such as the City Plan 2040 and Destination City.

An investigation took place into hundreds of complaints over contributions to a Warwickshire County Council scrutiny panel debate in January. Jeff Morgan, Brian Hammersley and Clare Golby have all been cleared of breaching the authority's code of conduct. The investigation found Mr Morgan and Mr Hammersley had been entitled to make comments, although disrespectful, under freedom of speech protections, while Ms Golby's words were not deemed to have been disrespectful. The three were debating analysis which addressed some of the demand and cost pressures that had led to overspends for authorities around the country. Comments surrounded the scale of demand, with Mr Morgan questioning whether some children put forward for assessments were \"just really badly behaved\" and in need of \"some form of strict correction\". Mr Hammersley asked whether a surge in demand was down to \"something in the water\" and Ms Golby referred to social media pages where \"families are swapping tips on how to get their children diagnosed\". The investigation found Mr Morgan and Mr Hammersley had failed to be respectful, \"champion the needs of the whole community\" and uphold the reputation of the council, but also that they had been entitled to make the comments under freedom of speech protections. Ms Golby's words were deemed not to have been disrespectful, nor to have caused reputational damage or a failure to champion the needs of the whole community. Clare Golby's words were not deemed to have been disrespectful The findings, external relating to Mr Hammersley and Mr Morgan recommended that the authority's chief executive \"considers ways in\u00a0which councillors can be supported to engage fully in debate at scrutiny and other committee meetings whilst ensuring that the language used is respectful, courteous, and sensitive to the matter concerned\".

Mother-of-two Abbie Mundy told the BBC at the protest: \"The language used was damaging and they really need to take responsibility for their words. \u201cAs soon as I saw the video, I felt sick, it\u2019s out of date and they need to be educated more on SEND, they are making these decisions but they know nothing about it.\u201d This news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.

BBC News has analysed spills data from nine firms, which suggests sewage may have been discharged nearly 6,000 times when it had not been raining in 2022 - including during the country\u2019s record heatwave. Water companies can release untreated sewage into rivers and seas when it rains to prevent it flooding homes, but such spills are illegal when it\u2019s dry. The firms say they understand public concerns around dry spilling, but they disagree with the BBC\u2019s findings. They have said the spill data shared with the Environment Agency was \u201cpreliminary\u201d and \u201cunverified\u201d, and also disagree with how the BBC defined a dry spill, which they say differs from the Environment Agency\u2019s approach. Why is sewage released into rivers and the sea? England sewage spills more than double in 2023 The latest findings follow a BBC investigation conducted last year which found 388 instances of possible dry spilling in 2022 by three water companies - Thames, Wessex and Southern - after they shared their data with the BBC. The other six \u2013 Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Severn Trent, South West Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water - had refused to share data about when they might be spilling with the BBC. They said it could prejudice an ongoing criminal investigation by the Environment Agency, external (EA) and Ofwat into their activities, external. The regulator \u2013 the Environment Agency \u2013 which had the data, disagreed, and in January handed it to the BBC. Speaking to the BBC before the election, Helen Wakeham, head of water at the EA, said the whole point of monitoring was to increase transparency, and they wanted to make the data more publicly available. Overflow points where sewage is discharged have monitors which record when spills start and stop. The BBC cross-referenced the companies\u2019 spill data from these overflow points with local Met Office rainfall data. Over 18 months we analysed data from nearly 10,000 monitors which had recorded more than 1.5 million hours of discharges. BBC analysis suggests dry spills may have started on more than 200 days in 2022, lasting more than 29,000 hours \u2013 including during the record summer heatwave when people were cooling off in England\u2019s rivers and seas. \u201cWe are most concerned about those [spill] events happening in places where people are likely to go in the river,\u201d said Professor Barbara Evans, chair in public health engineering at the University of Leeds. Consumption of water contaminated with human or animal faeces exposes people to parasites and bacteria such as cryptosporidium and E.coli, which cause diarrhoea and vomiting, or viruses like hepatitis A which can lead to liver infection. The six water companies who were subject of the latest investigation took issue with the BBC\u2019s analysis, citing the data we used and the methodology. Every year England\u2019s water companies are required to submit an annual report to the EA summarising their discharges. This enables the EA to investigate potential cases of dry spills and to decide whether it will take any action. The BBC has been analysing data behind the 2022 report, but in responding to our findings, the water companies argue that the datasets are unverified and contain errors. Examples of potential dry spills in the data were presented to each water company. Anglian Water disagreed with all the examples presented and the remaining five companies disagreed with some. The main reason the companies gave for disputing the examples was that their monitors malfunctioned and incorrectly recorded spills. From 2025, all water companies have committed to publishing near real-time sewage maps for the public to increase transparency. They will use the data from these monitors to create the maps. David Henderson, CEO of the industry body, Water UK, told the BBC: \u201cWe are the most transparent industry in the world when it comes to water. No other country in the world publishes this sort of data.\u201d In May, Anglian Water was found guilty of failing to provide data to the Environment Agency for their investigation \u2013 and it will be sentenced in July. The water industry has committed to spending \u00a3100bn between 2025 and 2030 Regarding the BBC\u2019s methodology, some of the water companies argue it did not take into account that some outlets have large catchment areas and it can take a few days for any rainfall to drain through their systems, i.e. sewage detected on a dry day may be the remnants from an earlier rainy day. However, the BBC accounted for drain-down time by only considering a discharge a potential dry spill when there had been four consecutive days in the surrounding area without rain. Helen Wakeham from the EA says the BBC\u2019s methodology is, in fact, \u201cmore generous\u201d to the companies than the EA\u2019s. Commenting on the results of the BBC\u2019s investigation in general she said: \u201cI'm not surprised, these networks haven't been invested in for decades. That investment needs to take place.\u201d In May the UK\u2019s top engineers and medical professionals warned in a public report the risk from human faecal matter in our rivers will increase without changes to the network and how we build our cities. Dr David Butler, professor of water engineering at the University of Exeter, and co-author of the report, said investment from water companies has \u201cnot really been up to scratch\u201d. But he added that we must also rethink how we design our towns and cities. \u201cWhat we would like to see is reversing urban creep - that is well beyond the powers of a water company. You see it all the time, people concreting over their front garden,\u201d Prof Butler explained. \u201cIf you could unpick that it would help because that would reduce stormwater runoff and that would give us more capacity in our pipes.\u201d Reducing dry spilling would also help prevent excessive nutrients entering rivers from sewage discharging. The issue, which is also associated with agriculture, can cause excessive amounts of algae to grow, resulting in waterways becoming depleted of oxygen, killing off other animals like fish. \u201c[It] also can have knock-on health effects, because this algae can produce other toxic products which might be harmful to human health,\u201d said Prof Evans of University of Leeds. South West Water said: \u201cWe are clear that storm overflows must only be used when absolutely necessary to protect people\u2019s homes and regard all unpermitted dry spills as unacceptable.\u201d Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water said they: \u201cDo not believe the [BBC\u2019s findings] are true reflection of dry discharge numbers.\u201d United Utilities said: \u201cThe information you have received from the Environment Agency reflects unvalidated, raw signals and not validated start\/stop times.\u201d Anglian declined to provide a formal comment on the BBC analysis, but in correspondence to the BBC said that the monitor data was not enough to determine dry spills due to monitor malfunctions, and said the methodology was flawed. The three companies investigated by the BBC last year also responded to our new findings. A Thames Water spokesperson said: \u201cThere are a number of methodologies for defining and calculating why and how dry day spills occur. \u201cWe regard all discharges of untreated sewage as unacceptable, and we have planned investment in our sewage treatment works to reduce the need for untreated discharges.\u201d A Wessex Water spokesperson said: \u201cNaturally occurring groundwater can enter sewers, often from private pipes and in dry weather, which can cause overflows to operate for days or even months. \u201cWe agree overflows are outdated so we\u2019re investing \u00a33 million a month to help reduce how often they automatically operate.\u201d A spokesperson for Southern Water said: \u201cIn areas with high levels of residual groundwater, spills can happen outside of periods of rainfall. Without these releases \u2013 made up almost entirely of groundwater \u2013 homes and communities would be flooded. \u201cCombatting these groundwater spills is a key part of our \u00a31.5 billion Clean Rivers and Seas Plan, which is designed to drastically reduce all storm overflows across our region by 2030.\u201d Water and sewerage companies are responsible for outlets known as combined sewer overflows (CSOs), which release sewage from treatment works or the sewage network into the UK's waterways. The majority of CSOs record when they discharge. For this analysis, the BBC took the start-stop times of individual discharges from the CSOs and converted them into the standard 12\/24-hour counting blocks used by the EA to determine \"spills\". In the specific case of United Utilities, the BBC found that some of the discharge data provided to the EA did not correspond to their 2022 annual report summarising this data. For that reason, the BBC discounted data from more than one-third of United's overflows. The start times of the companies' spills were matched to daily rainfall data from the Met Office, which is produced from a network of automatic rainfall gauges and observation stations. This rainfall data is presented in gridded squares that cover the land area of the UK. Each grid cell is 1km sq. Each overflow point is part of a larger network, or catchment area, and rain further away can take time to reach the overflow point. The BBC considered the nine grid squares nearest to each spill site in the analysis. Individual catchment areas may be larger or smaller. The EA defines a dry day as one during which there was less than 0.25mm of rain and less than 0.25mm of rain the previous day. But the BBC took a conservative approach of four consecutive days without rain in all nine grid squares to allow for drain-down time. The methodology was independently reviewed by three academic experts working in this field.

He had travelled from his home in Llandudno to hear former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells give evidence, breaking her near-decade long silence. \u201cIt was all a bit of a surprise,\u201d Sir Alan, as he is now known, told the BBC. He was told that he had to let the Honours Committee know by the end of the day whether he would accept. For the last 15 years, Sir Alan has campaigned for justice for hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongfully prosecuted for theft and false accounting, when faulty software called Horizon made it look like money was missing from their accounts. He had already rejected the offer of an OBE last year, telling the Honours Committee that it would be inappropriate to accept it whilst Ms Vennells kept hold of her CBE for services to the Post Office and many victims continued to suffer. Ms Vennells handed back her CBE earlier this year amid mounting pressure in the aftermath of the ITV drama in January which sparked national outrage over the scandal. \u201cI went and had a confidential talk with somebody who knows what\u2019s gone on over the years and they said to me, 'well you\u2019ve done the heavy lifting, others are doing the rest now.' And on reflection, I knew so many people who were keen for me to actually receive something, I felt I would be insulting them as much as anyone else if I refused it at this time,\" Sir Alan said.

Tracey Emin on becoming a dame and getting cancer all-clear He insisted the honour was not just for him but also for his group, the Justice for Sub-Postmasters Alliance, which he started in 2009. \u201cI think it\u2019s another string to my bow to try and drive the rest of the campaign home. We have got to get funding for everybody. And that\u2019s been my priority now for some time. And if it helps there, then great. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Sir Alan said his work was far from finished, adding that he would pursue court action, if necessary, to get financial redress for the victims who took part in the original High Court action that helped expose the Horizon IT scandal. \u201cI think the nation will support us if we have to go ahead with another case,\u201d he said. The former sub-postmaster's dogged pursuit of the truth began after refusing to accept losses at his own post office which he took over in 1998. Had he ever thought about giving up and letting it go? \u201cI could never do that. We\u2019ve all seen the horror stories, and there are so many. I keep hearing from so many more these days who are coming out of the woodwork and stories that have never been told. I mean, they\u2019re absolutely diabolical.  \"What\u2019s happened to people is very sad but at least they\u2019re now starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel for themselves.\u201d He described his work as the best unpaid job he\u2019d ever had and said he was looking forward to having a holiday this summer.

It expands a December programme to target foreign banks deemed to be aiding Russia's war effort in Ukraine. The US also placed sanctions on the Moscow stock exchange, leading to it halting trading in dollars and euros. It also moved to try to restrict Russia's use of technology, including chips and software. US President Joe Biden signed an executive order in December that imposed sanctions on banks dealing with about 1,200 individuals and companies deemed to be helping Russia's war machine. Those measures, which expose banks to the risk of being cut off from the US financial system, have now been expanded to about 4,500 entities. The US will also target gold-laundering. Peter Harrell, a former White House senior director for international economics, told the Reuters news agency that the US \"is shifting towards something that begins to look like an effort to set up a global financial embargo on Russia\". As part of this effort, the US Treasury announced that it would impose sanctions on parts of Russia's financial system, including the Moscow Exchange, which is one of Russia's main stock exchanges. The stock exchange, which is Russia's largest foreign exchange market, said the sanctions had forced it to stop trading in dollars and euros. The US also focused on technology. Chips and other technology made in the US have been found in downed Russian equipment on Ukraine battlefields, including drones, radios, missiles and armoured vehicles. The sanctions aim to make it more difficult for companies to supply that tech. The US will target shell firms in Hong Kong selling chips to Russia. In addition, software and IT services will also be restricted, although the US said its actions \"are not intended to disrupt civil society and civil telecommunications\". Despite the wave of sanctions brought against Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund predicts that the country will record economic growth of 3.2% this year.  But analysts said the measures will eventually make it harder for Moscow to wage its war, and over time weaken Russia's economy. \u201cRussia\u2019s war economy is deeply isolated from the international financial system, leaving the Kremlin\u2019s military desperate for access to the outside world,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. \u201cToday\u2019s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries,\" she added. The US announced the decision as Mr Biden prepared for a G7 summit in southern Italy with the leaders of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. One of the G7 leaders' priorities is boosting support for Ukraine, which is now into its third year of resisting Russia's invasion.

The money will be used to support police operations in theft hotspots, as well as to fund intelligence gathering. Earlier this year, the company\u2019s boss angrily denied reports that Range Rovers were particularly vulnerable to theft. However, owners have complained that insurers have been hiking their premiums dramatically, or even refusing cover. Among them is Meryl Cabellos, a 41-year-old Frenchman who has lived in the UK for seven years, and works in the technology industry. Last year, the cost of insuring his 2017 Range Rover Sport doubled, from \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000. He then discovered that his insurer would not be able to renew his cover at all this year \u2013 and struggled to find a replacement. Meryl Cabellos says he loved his Range Rover Sport but sold it because the insurance became too expensive Faced with a best quote of \u00a310,000, and with the car itself losing value rapidly, he decided to cut his losses and sell it. \u201cWe\u2019ve been Range Rover customers for many years, and it really feels as though we\u2019re being priced out now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just really disappointed. We loved the car but because of the insurance the experience of owning it went downhill so quick.\u201d Insurance costs can vary considerably, with factors such as the driver\u2019s record and experience, as well as where the car is kept and the security features it contains all taken into account. Expensive, luxury cars are often targeted by thieves, because they can be sold abroad at a big profit. That, in turn, can push up premiums. For Jaguar Land Rover, this has become a problem. The company builds a range of premium models, with the Range Rover brand a particular favourite for celebrities, politicians and even royalty. Gang jailed for \u00a3500,000 keyless car thefts  Stolen cars 'worth \u00a31m' found during police raid That kind of prestige comes at a cost. The Range Rover starts at \u00a3104,000 while its smaller sibling, the Range Rover Sport, is on sale from \u00a375,000. But embarrassingly for the company, it also has a reputation for being vulnerable to theft. Earlier this year, JLR\u2019s chief executive Adrian Mardell condemned reports that suggested the Range Rover was Britain\u2019s \u201cmost stolen vehicle\u201d. He admitted that vehicle theft by organised criminals was a serious issue in the UK, but insisted his own business had been unfairly singled out, and that strenuous efforts had been made to improve vehicle security. He accused the insurance industry of failing to take account of all the available information when setting premiums. The police funding is the latest in a series of moves designed to reassure consumers and attempt to bring down insurance costs. Last year, for example, the company set up its own insurance products in an effort to help customers who were unable to obtain cover, though some Range Rover owners claim they have still been unable to obtain quotes.  The new money, JLR says, will be used to support several police forces \u201cwith additional dedicated resources to respond to vehicle thefts across the country\u201d. It will also help pay for a new national policing unit to gather intelligence on vehicle thefts, and increased police activity at the ports used by criminal gangs to ship cars abroad. The company says it is already sharing information with the police to help them find and recover vehicles, and has provided training to some 650 officers. At the same time, it says it has been working hard to make its vehicles less vulnerable to theft. It cites data from the Police National Computer showing that since January 2022 only 0.2% of new Range Rovers and Range Rover Sports have been stolen.

It is not yet clear how the issue was discovered or whether it was specifically related to people working from home.  The US bank said staff had been fired or resigned \"after review of allegations involving simulation of keyboard activity creating impression of active work\". New rules recently came into effect in the US which mean that brokers working from home must be inspected every three years.  A spokeswoman for the firm said: \"Wells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behaviour.\" In 2022, Wells Fargo said it had adopted a hybrid flexible working model with staff permitted to work from home some of the time. Some large companies have been using increasingly sophisticated tools to monitor employees since remote work expanded during the Covid pandemic. Such services can track keystrokes and eye movements, take screenshots and log which websites are visited. But technology has also evolved to evade the surveillance, including so-called \"mouse jigglers\" which are aimed at making computers appear to be in active use which are widely available. According to Amazon, where they can be found for less than $10, thousands have been sold in the last month. Bloomberg, which first reported the move based on a filing Wells Fargo made to the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said that more than a dozen people had been affected.  The BBC has confirmed six instances in which staff had been discharged after review, and one case in which a person resigned voluntarily after being confronted with the claims. Many of them had worked for Wells Fargo for less than five years. Many firms, especially in the financial industry, are pushing staff to return to the office.  Remote work has remained popular since the pandemic but numbers have been drifting lower.  In the US, just under 27% of paid days last month were work-from-home days, compared with more than 60% at the height of the pandemic in 2020, according to research by professors at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico (ITAM) Business School, Stanford and University of Chicago. As of this spring, about 13% of full-time employees in the US were fully remote, and another 26% enjoyed a hybrid arrangement, according to the researchers.

It is one of two new inquiries involving Boeing planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently confirmed. The agency is also involved after Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes. The issues have emerged at a time when the safety record of Boeing planes is under intense scrutiny. Boeing referred questions about the Southwest flight to the airline, which said it was co-operating with the investigation.  Boeing also said that the titanium issue was \"industry-wide\", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers.  It said tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.  The company said it sourced the metal separately from its supplier and it believed a small number of parts had been affected. \"To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,\u201d  the company said.  The New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion.  Spirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000  tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production. \"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium,\" spokesman Joe Buccino said. \"The problem is we've lost traceability.\" The FAA said Boeing had issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records and that it was probing the scope of the issue. Canadian transportation safety officials said in a separate statement that they were working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue, and that officials \"will not hesitate to take action\". The so-called Dutch roll, said to have been named after an ice-skating technique attributed to the Netherlands, occurred on a 25 May flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California.  The FAA said the aircraft regained control and no-one on board was injured, but the plane suffered \"substantial\" damage.  A post-flight inspection of the two-year-old plane revealed significant damage to a unit that provides backup power to the rudder.  \"Dutch roll can be unpleasant but the 737 exhibits relatively benign characteristics.  The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing,\" said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant. Safety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing.  An incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing.  Boeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues.  Theo Leggett contributed to this article.

The account, GenZBloomer, is one of dozens across X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok which the BBC has identified as posting hundreds of repeated messages in comment threads expressing support for Reform UK. Their behaviour has prompted claims from other social media users that they are fake - automated \"bot\" accounts - and they are distorting the online conversation to try to exaggerate the popularity of Reform UK. The BBC contacted people behind the accounts and found that some are genuine UK voters who believe they are helping the party through their own initiative. Others, however, failed to prove they were authentic. I spotted this pattern of comments in posts recommended to the feeds of our Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people based around the UK with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content.

They have pointed out phrases a native speaker would be unlikely to use, such as \"make an article\" instead of \"write an article\" and \"neighbourhood tavern\" instead of \"local pub\". Others are convinced the GenZbloomer profile must be parody - particularly referring to a blog post the account shared on X about how \"young men are struggling out here to find traditional British women to date\" because women think they are \"better than everyone else because of Love Island and Starmer\", referring to the Labour leader Sir Keir. The person who claimed to be behind GenZbloomer told me they were based in \"the Annesley England area\" - an unusual way to describe the small village in Nottinghamshire  - and gave me a UK mobile phone number. They agreed to speak to me on the phone, but then did not answer any of my calls. GenZBloomer has posted hundreds of times about Reform UK on X On WhatsApp, their account is labelled as a business account for a \"consulting agency\", and features a profile image of a faceless cartoon figure with a microphone headset on. In messages with grammatical mistakes, they claimed to be a \"generation Z voter\" who wants a \"proper Brexit but the conservatives party ruined\". The account claimed to be working \"with Reform UK\" in order to \"help them win and spread their values across the UK\". The person who had been messaging me provided no evidence to support this claim - and a Reform UK spokesperson said this profile was not connected to the party at all. Reform UK told the BBC it had been in touch with social media companies about other accounts falsely purporting to be connected with the party. Some responses to my messages from GenZbloomer sounded like parody - describing how they would have to speak to a Reform Party county organiser before they spoke to me, but adding that it \"should not be an issue Reform has a super lax vetting process\". After a back-and-forth over text message, my phone number then appeared to have been blocked. Since this article was first published, the GenZbloomer account has been suspended by X for violating its rules. Some social media users have claimed comments in support of Reform UK are being posted by bots Social media users now seem more likely to accuse other accounts of being bots - alleging they undermine trust and disrupt the online debate, even when some of these profiles turn out to be genuine. In the past decade, there have been documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to sow division and promote particular points of view during Western elections. They have used networks of what social media firms call \"inauthentic accounts\" and what users call bots or \"troll farms\". Whether the actions of these accounts changed anyone\u2019s mind is unclear. In recent weeks, Reform UK has seen a genuine rise in the polls - which may partly explain its growing role in the online conversation. A spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"We are, of course, delighted about the organic growth of online support, but with that come some accounts that are not formally associated with the party, but actively subvert and lie about who we are.\" The spokesman said some people wrongly believe the only way others could end up supporting Reform UK was if they had been fooled in some way by the internet. In total, I found more than 50 profiles that had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts, posting in support of Reform UK across the different social media sites - although they could still have been genuine. These hallmarks can include a username and profile picture with no identifying features, no followers or seemingly real friends - and engaging entirely with political or divisive content, or reposting the same repetitive phrases. The BBC's Undercover Voter profiles in Bridgend were pushed content which included the alleged bot comments Some had no posts of their own. Others, seemingly based outside the UK,  previously posted about US politics and sports or animal cruelty before switching to Reform UK. Several had also shared conspiracy theory content about Covid-19 or posts opposing Ukraine and supporting Russia. I have not found other accounts posting about other political parties in the same way - or being met with the same accusations. Many of these accounts did not respond when I contacted them. But one called username341317847855 did. He said his name was Martin and he agreed to speak to me on the phone from the quiet of his van in London. \"Of course I'm a real person. I'm just fed up with the government. I'm fed up with MPs,\" he said. He made light of the bot claims, joking that I could call him \"Martin the Bot\" and telling me he was not worried that these accusations might undermine Reform UK\u2019s social media posts. Martin said no political parties or users have encouraged him to post. He said he decided to vote for the first time in this election. This account had some of the hallmarks of a bot, but the BBC traced it to a first-time voter named Martin in London Several more of these accounts told me they were real people based in the UK, who were just sharing their political views. Some shared evidence with me to demonstrate this. One account run by someone called Matt said: \"I can assure you I'm not a bot. I'm politically homeless.\" He said he was from Bury, was aged 46 and a welder by trade. He does not have any profile picture or posts on his TikTok account, only comments on the videos of others. He told me that no political party or anyone else had instructed him to comment in support of Reform UK. Matt said that when he saw the other profiles posting these comments similar to his on social media, it helped him and others realise \"they are not the only ones who feel this way and have these views\". What Matt\u2019s experience seems to show is that comments that boost the perceived support for a political party - whether they come from UK voters or inauthentic accounts - can embolden more real people to join in. It is one more piece of evidence in this election that suggests individual social media users and anonymous accounts have the ability to shape the online conversation just as effectively as the content coming from the political parties themselves. A TikTok spokesperson has previously told the BBC it has introduced \"more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference\". \"Creating fake accounts or engaging in inauthentic activities goes against Meta's policies\", a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC. X, formerly Twitter, said they \"remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation\". Two of the three Bridgend Undercover Voters were recommended content linked to the Reform UK bot claims The Undercover Voters are fictional profiles designed to represent a range of voters in battleground constituencies across the UK. They follow, view and like content relevant to their character, informed by data and analysis from the National Centre for Social Research. For this story, I examined the feeds of the profiles of some of these fictional voters in the constituency of Bridgend in Wales, which is currently held by the Conservatives and is a Labour target. Gavin - a right-leaning voter in his 60s who has a strong interest in politics - has had content about Reform UK actively recommended to him across his social media feeds, including material with the alleged bot posts in the comments. On the other hand, 72-year-old Eluned - a left-leaning Welsh Nationalist who is very supportive of the European Union - has been pushed several posts and comments from people concerned that these profiles supporting Reform are bots.

Then one of the most famous groups in music history started playing their music. Kelly and band-mate Frances McKee were in college when they formed The Vaselines in 1987. \"We lasted two-and-a-half years and released two singles and an album. That was it,\" says Kelly. \"It was fun. We didn't take it seriously, though we were serious about the song-writing.\" He adds: \"We knew we didn't have a chance to be a big band.  \"No big record labels were interested and we weren't getting into the charts or on Top of the Pops.\"  The Vaselines will play at this summer's Belladrum music festival  The Vaselines broke up in 1989. McKee was a primary school teacher for a while and formed bands Painkillers and then Suckle. The latter released an album. Kelly worked in a bar and formed Captain America, before later changing the name to Eugenius.  The band, which featured members of BMX Bandits and Teenage Fanclub, released two albums and opened European dates for Nirvana. Kelly and McKee also released solo albums. But in the early 1990s, millions of music fans became aware of the songs they wrote as The Vaselines. Nirvana had exploded on to the world music scene.  The US band, whose hits included Smells Like Teen Spirit, would go on to sell more than 75 million records. Nirvana's frontman Kurt Cobain was a huge Vaselines fan. Nirvana were one of the biggest bands of the 1990s Nirvana performed and recorded three Vaselines songs: Molly's Lips, Son of A Gun and Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam - which Cobain also performed live on MTV. With Cobain's encouragement, The Vaselines reformed briefly for a 1990 Nirvana gig in Edinburgh. Kelly also sang Molly's Lips with Cobain at 1991's Reading Festival. Nirvana recorded some of the most memorable songs of the 1990s, including Smells Like Teen Spirit and Lithium. Cobain took his own life in 1994. The rest of Nirvana would later go on to pursue their own music interests. Dave Grohl, the band's drummer, is heading for Glasgow's Hampden stadium next week with his band the Foo Fighters. Kelly, right, sings with Cobain at 1991's Reading Festival Kelly says he knows mention of Nirvana is likely to come up in interviews at some point, often in a question \"sneaked in\" at the end. But he says: \"There is no downside to a band like Nirvana recording your songs, and we're happy to talk about it because we are really grateful that it happened. \"I think we would pretty much be a forgotten band.  \"Not even a one-hit - a no-hit wonder.\" The Vaselines reformed in 2008 and began recording new music. The connection to Nirvana has helped ensure an audience, but Kelly says huge challenges remain for the band and other musicians trying to make a living in the industry.  \"It is tough for bands that are not super famous,\" he says. \"The music industry doesn't seem to support upcoming, interesting, odd ball kind of music. \"We've always been lo-fi and definitely see ourselves as part-timers and outsiders.\" He adds: \"Brexit has made it so much more expensive to play somewhere like France, Spain or Germany. \"We can't really afford to go to America, which we love playing, because visa costs are so expensive.\" But Kelly goes on: \"I love playing the shows, I love playing and singing live.  \"It is great to be able to do it.\" Frances McKee and Eugene Kelly first formed The Vaselines in the late 1980s This year The Vaselines are to perform in Dunfermline, Galashiels, Glasgow, Dunbar and next month's Belladrum music festival near Inverness. The other musicians in the band are Michael McGaughrin on drums, Graeme Smillie in bass and Carla Easton on keyboards. Kelly says: \"We are always interested in playing new places and a festival is great because you play to a bigger crowd and also get the chance to make some new fans.\" Looking back to when The Vaselines split, he says: \"To be doing it now over 30 years later is just bizarre. \"The shows have started to sell out.\" He jokes: \"We have been on a slow upward trajectory.\" Kelly adds they hope to write some new songs. \"You heard it here first,\" he says. \"It might or might not work out, but we are definitely thinking about it.\" Putin peace terms slammed at Ukraine summit Kate returns to public events at Trooping the Colour What does Nigel Farage really want?

The airlifts of seven Przewalski's Horses from Europe to the Central Asian country took place in early June in an operation run by Prague Zoo. Researchers told the BBC that the horses are already doing well two weeks in: roaming around the plains and even beginning the mating process. Zoo officials say it's a triumph of generations of conservation work. \"This is an endangered species returning to their ancestral lands, a species which went extinct in the wild in the 1960s, last seen in Mongolia...so it's just marvellous... a miracle,\" said Filip Ma\u0161ek, a spokesman for Prague Zoo. While the horses have been slowly reintroduced to Mongolia and China in recent decades, this operation marks the first time they are back in Kazakhstan. The Przewalski's Horse is the last wild horse species on the planet, named after Russian explorer Nikolai Przewalski who was the first to identify the horse for the European science community. The species originated millennia ago from the steppes of Central Asia and was taken by researchers to Europe and North America in the 19th and 20th Centuries, where populations were established in zoos. Some of them ended up in zoos in Munich and Prague - it's their descendants that have now been reintroduced in Kazakhstan. Cultural artefacts show people in the country's north were riding and using the horses for food at least 2,000 years before records of domesticated horses in Europe. But by the time of Przewalski's \"discovery\" in 1879, the horses could only be found in a small section of western Mongolia. Competition with humans and livestock, along with changes in the environment led to them dying out. Recognising the threat, international efforts were made after World War Two to save the animals. Prague Zoo was entrusted with the \"international studship\" of the breed. It introduced the first contingent back into Kazakhstan  last week- a group consisting of one stallion and six mares. It aims to bring in at least 40 more over the next five years. \"This is an event of historical import,\" said the zoo's director Miroslav Bobek in a statement. \"The seven horses that we transported here by two Czech Army planes represent the first individuals of this species in central Kazakhstan in hundreds of years.\" A Przewalski's horse being released in Mongolia in 2017 Przewalski's horse has long been considered the one true remaining wild horse species- as species such as the American mustang and Australian brumby are feral horses descended from domesticated animals. The Przewalski's horse is shorter and stockier than modern domesticated horses and their genetic differences show that neither species are ancestors of the other. Prague Zoo, which has spent the past decade and a half introducing the horses back to Central Asia, mainly in Mongolia, said the Kazakhstan operations had been in the plans since 2022 after signing a deal with the local government.  Last week saw the culmination of years of work. Prague Zoo selected horses from different programmes around Europe and put them together in the same zoo in Berlin - Tierpark Berlin - for several months to become acquainted before their journey. That then kicked off in early June, with military aeroplanes flying the standing horses in two groups on a 6,000km-route that included stopovers in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Once they touched ground at the Arkalyk Airport in Kazakhstan, they were taken on an eight-hour drive to the plains where they were then finally released onto the Altyn Dala - the Kazakh name for the Golden Steppe. \u201c[The mare named] Tessa was the first to run out of the transport box into the pen, then Wespe, followed by Umbra, and Sary brought the foursome to a close,\" Mr Bobek said. On Thursday,  zoo spokesman Mr Ma\u0161ek told the BBC that the horses, after some initial trepidation, had begun to venture further afield. In a \"very good\" development, scientists this week also reported that some of the horses had begun to mate.  The group has been moved in early summer so they have time to adapt before winter, which is typically brutal on the plains. They will be kept to a 60 hectare \"acclimatisation\" pen for the first year before being released into the wider grasslands. Mr Ma\u0161ek said the zoo hoped to emulate the success of its Mongolia programme last decade - where the introduction of 34 horses had helped boost the native population to now well over 850 animals. Researchers are optimistic and hopeful, he said. He noted while human activity wasn't the sole reason for the horse's extinction, actions like hunting and breeding the species with domesticated horses accelerated their disappearance. \"We are still responsible the fact this wild horse disappeared and now we can sort of reverse that, and give it back to nature.\" He described it as the ultimate goal of a modern zoo: \"To sort of be these Noah's Arks which have all these endangered species. \"If it's possible- and sometimes it's not - we should try and do everything to return them to their original environments.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Iain Meiklejohn has been part of the Tartan Army for 30 years and said he did not want his 12-year-old son Aleks to miss Scotland playing in important matches.  Iain said he was unconcerned about his son missing school lessons and was certain he would have plenty of time to make up for it.  Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Iain said: \"Aleks will learn more in a couple of weeks out traveling than he will in school, coming towards the end of term when everything starts to wind down anyway.\" Iain and Aleks will follow the Scotland football team through Germany over the course of the 2024 Euro Championships. After staying in Frankfurt for one night they will travel to Munich to watch the first game of the group stages when Scotland take on Germany.  They will then move onto Cologne and Stuttgart where they will watch Scotland play Switzerland and Hungary. If Scotland manage to get through the group stages, Iain has prepared by taking enough time off work and letting Aleks' school know that he will be back when Scotland are knocked out. He sent an email to his son's school that said: \"We will be going on an educational trip through Germany visiting several cities where we will study the extreme emotional highs and lows that only a Scotland fan goes through. \"I will ensure Aleks completes a report on his return in full detail.

His dad said he was not concerned about any repercussions from the council or school authorities over his son's absence. He has previously taken Aleks to many football events during term time such as the World Cups in Russia and Brazil and the last European Championships.

Fans took the singer's encouragement to Shake It Off literally, with monitoring stations detecting seismic activity from 6km (3.73 miles) away. The energetic Swifties made the biggest commotion during three songs: Cruel Summer, Ready For It? and Champagne Problems. And it seems the 73,000-strong Friday night crowd danced, cheered and stomped the loudest of the three gigs. It marked the first of 17 UK dates for Swift, which will culminate in a record-breaking eight-night run at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Thousands of Swifties made 'unbelievable impact' on Edinburgh How 'Swiftonomics' is impacting the music industry The 152-date stadium tour is on track to make more than $2bn (\u00a31.56bn) by the time it wraps up in December, making it the most lucrative concert tour in music history. During her three Murrayfield performances, Swift played to 200,000 fans who came from all over the world to see her career-spanning, three-hour show. The Friday night concert was the most energetic by a small margin with fans making the ground move a maximum of 23.4 nanometres (nm), compared to 22.8nm and 23.3nm on the Saturday and Sunday respectively. The seismic activity was mainly caused by dancing and reached its peak at 160bpm during Ready For It? The Swifties created approximately 80kW of power during the song. Shake It Off and Cruel Summer made the ground move, but detectors even shook during a four-minute long applause for Champagne Problems. Swift's previous tour dates in Seattle and Los Angeles registered similar events, with her Seattle gig generating activity equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. Fans travelled to Edinburgh from all over the world to see the 14-time Grammy winner The British Geological Survey (BGS) is the UK's national earthquake monitoring agency and its detectors are sensitive enough to pick up the smallest seismic activity miles away. Callum Harrison, BGS seismologist, said: \"It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve been able to measure the reaction of thousands of concert goers remotely through our data.  \"The opportunity to explore a seismic activity created by a different kind of phenomenon has been a thrill. \"Clearly Scotland\u2019s reputation for providing some of the most enthusiastic audiences remains well intact!\" The movement was detected at two monitoring stations, the furthest of which was 6km (three and a half miles) away, at the BGS office at Heriot Watt University. However experts said the movement generated by the concert was unlikely to have been felt by anyone other than those in the immediate vicinity. Ready for it?

This will be her first public appearance this year following the diagnosis, and her abdominal surgery in January.  But in a personal message, Catherine says her treatment is still ongoing and will continue for another few months. \"I am not out of the woods yet,\" says the princess. This is the most significant update on Catherine's health since revealing in March she had cancer, in a statement written in her own words. It is accompanied by a new photograph of the princess, taken by photographer Matt Porteous, which shows her near her home in Windsor. But there is caution with the positive message. \u201cAs anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\u201d she says. \"On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,\" says the princess. \"I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\"  Live updates Statement in full What do we know about Kate's cancer? For Trooping the Colour, the princess will be in the carriage parade with her children and will be part of the family group waving from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. This event is a birthday parade for the monarch and a palace spokesman said King Charles III was \u201cdelighted that the princess is able to attend tomorrow\u2019s events\u201d. The princess has also expressed her thanks for messages of public support during her illness, saying she has been \"blown away\" by the encouragement. \"It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times,\" says the message from the princess. The princess has begun to work from home and expects to attend some events over the summer, but Kensington Palace has emphasised that this is not a full return and that plans could be changed at short notice. Cancer Research UK thanked Catherine for sharing an update on her treatment.  \"Her words will mean so much to other cancer patients going through their own experience,\" the charity's chief executive Michelle Mitchell said. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said people living with cancer and their families would draw \"hope and inspiration\" from Catherine following her statement, while Sir Keir Starmer wished the princess the \"very best\" as her treatment continues.

He made a number of striking statistical claims on a host of subjects. Here we examine some of them. He did not specify what statistical source this was based on and this claim needs context.  Annual net migration - the difference between people coming to the UK and leaving - in the year to December 2023 was 685,000. Assuming the population increase due to net migration occurred evenly through the year, this would amount to 2.6 people every two minutes. The average UK household occupancy in 2023 was about 2.4 people, according to the Office for National Statistics. So if every new member of the UK population due to net migration last year ended up in a household of 2.4 people and that household required a new home to live in, you could get to a statistic similar to that cited by Mr Farage. However, this kind of calculation does not take into account some existing homes being vacant, or how many people, on average, live in a household formed by new migrants. Moreover, analysts say the interaction of immigration and housing demand is complex - and the main impact is likely to be through house prices and rents. The government\u2019s Migration Advisory Committee, its official advisory body, found evidence in 2018 that a 1% population increase due to migration leads to a 1% rise in house prices. But the Migration Observatory concluded more recently that \u201cit is challenging to establish a causal relationship between the price of housing and the level of immigration with any precision\u201d. Seven-party BBC election debate fact-checked Taxes, NHS waiting lists and small boats - BBC Verify tests key claims This claim is not correct if you look at the latest figures for overall migrant visas.  Mr Farage did not specify which time period he was talking about but in the year ending March 2024, about a third of all visas issued went to dependants. His claim is broadly correct though on the numbers coming on work visas. Out of all the work visas issued in the year ending March 2024, 48% were issued to dependants. However, it is worth noting that dependants of a person on a skilled worker visa or a student visa are not entitled to claim benefits in the UK. And they are allowed to work - although we don\u2019t know what proportion do so. The UK actually has \u201clow levels of proven electoral fraud\u201d, according to the Electoral Commission, an independent body tasked by Parliament with overseeing UK elections.  Its data shows that of the 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, 11 led to convictions and the police issued four cautions. Of the five convictions for electoral fraud in elections held in 2019, one of them involved postal ballots. This claim is misleading.  Scientists at Nasa told Reuters in March that human activity has been responsible for around 33% of the total carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.  The natural world recycles hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 every year. But what really matters for the climate is how CO2 levels change over time. Without human influence, the amount of CO2 produced would roughly equal the amount absorbed - meaning the level of CO2 in the atmosphere would stay roughly the same.  But since 1750, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 50%. It is at its highest level for two million years. The UN\u2019s climate body - the IPCC - produces comprehensive reports on the state of knowledge about global warming, drawing on the work of the world's scientists. The IPCC concluded in its 2023 report that \u201chuman activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming\u201d. It is difficult to come to a verdict on this claim because there is no breakdown of shoplifting prosecutions, by value of goods stolen.  Under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, there are different rules for prosecuting \u201clow-value shoplifting\u201d, defined as theft from a shop of goods valued at under \u00a3200. The maximum sentence for this is six months in prison, but the offence can be dealt with by issuing a fine (which would count as a prosecution).  There has been a large increase in shoplifting in recent years. According to the Office for National Statistics, in the year ending December 2023 the number of recorded shoplifting offences increased by over a third in England and Wales compared with the previous year. There were 430,000 offences in 2023 compared with 315,000 in 2022. In 2023, more than 31,000 people were prosecuted in England and Wales for theft from shops but these figures do not specify the value of goods stolen.

Officers attended the collision, on Ford Hill, Queensbury, at 02:47 BST on Thursday, and a 34-year-old man was treated at the scene.  One resident, whose parked car was damaged in the incident, said the collision was so forceful a vehicle almost ended up being shunted into her front room.  West Yorkshire Police said enquiries are continuing.  One of the cars almost ended up Holly Johnson's front room, after the crash triggered a series of collisions The incident occured when a white Audi crashed into a stationary car triggering a domino effect, and leading to six stationary cars on the residential street being damaged by the impact. Four of them are believed to have been written-off.  Resident Holly Johnson told the BBC: \"We woke to the sound of crashing, and car alarms going off. \"It was like a nightmare.  \"The Audi zoomed straight into a Citroen - then six cars in total were involved.  \"Someone from the Audi was injured - I could hear a lad screaming.\" It is understood the man's injuries are not serious.  Ms Johnson, 24, said: \"The cars all bounced along the road and one nearly came straight into my front room,  \"A gas pipe was also damaged - that could have led to a major gas leak and the house could have gone up in flames.\" A West Yorkshire Police spokesperson confirmed officers on patrol came across a multi-vehicle collision on Ford Hill. Ms Johnson, a teaching assistant, added: \"We're all so shaken up.  \"You just want to feel safe in your own house.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

What made you think yes I want to make a film about Sasquatch? David Zellner: Well, we've always loved Bigfoot and Bigfoot lore in general from when we were kids. We\u2019ve always been fascinated with all forms of cryptids but particularly Bigfoot because it was regional to where we grew up and there's not much else in terms of American mythology. So as adults, what interested us was the way it represents this kind of grey area between human and animal behaviour and our connection to the natural world. It felt like there were some interesting things to explore as a story. The quote-unquote footage out there of it (Bigfoot) is all the same. All the sightings\u00a0 are just bigfoot walking across the field over and over again and we were just like \u201cWell, what else is it doing?\u201d Well, they live a peaceful simple life... David: Haha, but you know, like any other animal you get to see a full spectrum of behaviour so that led us to want to explore more and approach it from that standpoint. This is also why we want to do it without any kind of filter of humans, who would then process the information you're seeing for you. So there\u2019s no humans in the movie \u2013 you're telling the story through no voiceover, we wanted the audience to be immersed in their world without judgment. So far we know that humans are the only animals that exhibit shame, so we wanted to see what it would be like for these animals to have human-like characteristics \u2013 showing the full spectrum of their behaviour and treating it all in the same level playing field. Lore can be interpreted in so many ways and we all have our own theories, but what is Sasquatch to you? Do you have an idea of what they are? Nathan: Yeah, it's weird because there\u2019s the very specific man in the woods thing but there\u2019s always been this missing link to it. There\u2019s the theory it\u2019s something that didn\u2019t evolve the same way because we have this relationship to primates and so this could be a Neanderthal or Cro-magnon or something like that. If there is any truth or validation to it, that's probably where a lot of the stories from way back came from. When the different stages of evolution happened and humans branched off maybe one got left behind and also became 8ft tall with mythical proportions because it was different.\u00a0 David: I think it's interesting to have so many different parts of the world develop their own creature in the woods myth and all independently. For instance, the other most famous one is the yeti, another hairy creature in the woods. All centuries old, all developed independently from one another, I think it\u2019s really fascinating how this creature represents our connection to the natural world and it\u2019s always just tied to that.\u00a0 People might have written about this I don't know but I\u2019m curious if as human civilisation developed and we went from rural communities to more centralised cities, there was such a separation between humans and the natural world that this myth evolved to bring us back to earth. Does that make sense?\u00a0 It makes sense, we constantly hear people longing to have been born in a time of less advancement and technology, with the need to go back to basics so that this creature was created. I too have always believed it was a Neanderthal that got left behind, but I always imagine they were by themselves so I love how you created this little family we follow through life, and all they do is walk across the woods because that\u2019s all we\u2019ve seen them do.\u00a0 When creating the script, how and when did you decide not to have it in a language that anyone could understand? And how was this rehearsed between the actors? Nathan:\u00a0Well, the script wasn't as long as a regular script, because it's kinda like a script where you\u2019ve pulled all the dialogue out of so it was about 60 pages, but it was very detailed and specific. One because you don't have the benefit of relying on other forms of exposition to convey what the story is, and two because there's not an easy comp for this, this, this film. For everyone involved, from the financiers to the cast, to the crew, we needed to make it crystal clear what the tone was. It's a mix of the kind of humour and pathos in equal measure, and without it being that dialled in the script, I think it is easy for people's go-to responses to be \u201cOh, it's a horror movie\u201d or something like that, so we just needed to be really clear from the outset what our tone was. The tone was very clear and it even got quite dark. I thought while watching that if the female sasquatch (Riley Keough) had a theme song it would be Reba\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m A Survivor\u201d\u00a0 Nathan & David: haha that is so good! You were putting my girl through it! Did you add these dark tones to create a more human connection with the audience? Nathan: Well when exploring this kind of uncomfortable area between human and animal behaviour we knew there'd be humour in it because there\u2019s there's behaviour in this film that you'd see your dog and cat do and you wouldn't think anything of it but if it's something with human-like qualities, it suddenly becomes uncomfortable. So we always knew that would be there. This is kind of way we like to work in general,\u00a0 to mix the humour and the melancholy but it's always a very intuitive process and never forced because the story kind of tells us which way to go. We wanted to have a certain level of poignancy and in showing the whole spectrum of the human condition through these creatures you can be open to the the lighter moments in the darker moments in equal measure. Nathan you actually had the pleasure of playing one of the Sasquatches, can you share how long the process was getting into that costume and just how sweaty did that get? Nathan: Hahaha! It was GALLONS of sweat! I knew you were roasting in that suit! Nathan: Haha yes I was! We had a rehearsal period that started on Zoom and then when we met in person Jesse Eisenberg had brought in a movement coach that he had worked with prior. The rehearsal wasn't really to talk through emotional beats, I mean we do but it wasn't like rehearsing lines or anything like that, it was more like trying to just get everyone comfortable with behaving like an animal. We were learning how to react from our id and subconscious more and how to technically move so that we're all looking like a family, like a species.\u00a0 There are a lot of rules that you can make up because there's only so much baseline to Bigfoot available, we built the movement off of the one famous video of it walking. It kind of lumbers and that gave us seeds to work from but a lot of it was taken from watching primate videos of how orangutans eat foods and hold things. Once you got that costume on it was a fully immersive process. it was really fun to disappear behind that makeup because you felt pretty uninhibited as you had about 40 pounds of fur on top of you. Thankfully, we shot kind of late in the fall so the weather, for the most part, was on our side, but there were a couple of days where the sun was just beating on you and you could just feel yourself baking underneath the costume. So when we would eventually pull it off the undersuit was just drenched in sweat. You finished filming two sizes smaller! David:\u00a0Haha yes it was like a sweat sponge! It\u2019s very different to a Planet of the Apes type film because you\u2019re not as reliant on CGI and you\u2019re really having to become this animal. Did you feel like immersing yourself so much in the character there were days you had to remind yourself to shake off the Neanderthal? Nathan: No no, because it wasn't as method as that. Most of the time in between takes, we were trying to conserve energy because it took so much energy. We wanted to do old-school prosthetics work and most of the time this type of work is done on sound stages and from a green screen so it's a little bit more controlled environment, so we had a lot of challenges. But from an acting standpoint, you\u2019re usually worried about overacting, because when you're an actor it\u2019s a lot about being subtle but when you have all this makeup on, you have to really project it and move through it. Even a slight head turn has to be a bigger movement so that you can get through the latex suits and the fur. So that was the biggest thing to learn from an acting standpoint. It\u2019s very theatrical, almost taking it back to silent films... David: Yes because we\u2019re big fans of silent films but it wasn\u2019t until we started making it that we realised we have to kind of rewire our braids to convey information in a way we weren\u2019t used to and hadn\u2019t done before. thumbnail credits:\u00a0Nbc \/ Nathan Congleton \/ NBC via Getty Images \/Jon Kopaloff \/ Getty Images for Vanity Fair"},{"author":"Amy Glover","title":"\"I Challenged Him To A Fight In My High School Parking Lot\" \u2014 People Are Sharing What They Did To Get Blocked By Celebs, And Wow, People Are Bold","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/aglover\/why-people-got-blocked-by-celebs","description":"\"The Head and Shoulders Twitter account blocked me because I Tweeted them every day for a month asking why they don't have a foot wash line called Knees and Toes.\"View Entire Post \u203a","date":"2024-06-14T12:04:02Z","content":"\"The Head and Shoulders Twitter account blocked me because I Tweeted them every day for a month asking why they don't have a foot wash line called Knees and Toes.\" BuzzFeed Staff Psst\u00a0\u2014\u00a0BuzzFeed didn't confirm these; all are alleged.

The 37-year-old has raised\u00a0$1.2 million for the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief through social media campaigns, and has shut down voices in the industry who have told her she will not get future work if she continues her advocacy.\u00a0 \u201cYou do get told, \u2018You won\u2019t get work,\u2019 \u2018You won\u2019t do this.\u2019 But I also think, deep down, if you know that you\u2019re coming from a place of \u2018I don\u2019t want any innocent people to suffer,\u2019 then I\u2019m not worried about people\u2019s reactions,\u201d the actor told Teen Vogue.\u00a0  Singer The Weeknd \u2014 aka Abel Tesfaye \u2014 has made two large donations in support of Palestinians. The first was a $2.5-million donation in December 2023 aimed at providing 820 metric tons of food parcels to feed Palestinians; and the second was a $2-million donation from his XO Humanitarian Fund in April. The money went toward 18 million loaves of bread for struggling families in Gaza, Variety reports.\u00a0 A long-standing and vocal advocate, singer Kehlani (who uses she\/they pronouns) used their \"Next 2 U\" music video to take a hard stance on the war. In addition to dancing in front of the Palestinian flag, Kehlani ended the video with the following message:\u00a0\u201cWe tried to make a scroll honoring the names of thousands of deceased children,\u201d it reads. \u201cThe list was so long that our fastest scroll at 3 minutes was illegible.\u201d So, they included a full list in the description.\u00a0 They also shared a series of videos on Instagram, in which Kehlani called out industry peers who have been silent on the war. \"Nothing we do has a fucking purpose without people and you can\u2019t turn the fuck around and reach back for people? You can\u2019t speak? Disgusting!\u201d she said.\u00a0 Wednesday actor Jenna Ortega has previously shared a link to the\u00a0Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund\u00a0on her Instagram story, according to Teen Vogue, and posted the photo below on Instagram with the message: \"Masses debating over a ceasefire while thousands upon thousands of children continue being slaughtered. Where is the humanity.\" At a pro-Palestine march in Washington, DC, singer Macklemore found himself being handed a mic and offering an impromptu speech. He said: \"I didn\u2019t expect to be on a microphone. There are thousands of people here more qualified to speak on the issue of a free Palestine than myself.\u00a0But I will say this.\u00a0They told me to be quiet. They told me to do my research, to go back, that it\u2019s too complex to say something, right? To be silent in this moment. In the last three weeks I\u2019ve gone back and I\u2019ve done some research \u2026 I\u2019m teachable. I don\u2019t know enough. But I know enough that this is a genocide.\" On May 28, singer Dua Lipa\u00a0shared a slide from the\u00a0Artists4Ceasefire organization, along with the message:\u00a0\u201cBurning children alive can never be justified. The whole world is mobilizing to stop the Israeli genocide. Please show your solidarity with Gaza.\" Ariana Grande re-shared Nicola Coughlan's post to raise funds for the Palestine Children's Relief Fund on her Instagram story.\u00a0 Euphoria actor Hunter Schafer was arrested at a February protest in support of Palestinians at NBC headquarters. The demonstration, organized by\u00a0Jewish Voice for Peace NYC, took place ahead of President Joe Biden's appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\u00a0 The group criticized Biden for his role in the war via providing arms to Israel, NBC News reported.\u00a0 Hunter was escorted out by police while wearing a ceasefire shirt.\u00a0 Former And Just Like That... actor Sara Ramirez previously shared support for a ceasefire and photos of themself at pro-Palestinian demonstrations on Instagram before they removed their account.\u00a0 In an Instagram post, the rapper and actor wrote: \"I can't watch what's happening in the world and remain silent. I can't imagine the pain people are feeling. Seeing their entire neighborhoods bombed, losing generations of family members, parents crying over their children's lifeless bodies, communities turning into mass graves, people digging through the rubble of their homes in hopes of finding remains of their loved ones \u2013 a pain no one should have to go through. ...The collective punishment Palestinians are suffering under Israel's illegal occupation is unfathomable. Anti-semitism is never welcome. But let's be clear \u2013 supporting Palestinian liberation is not antisemetic, it's human. Palestinians deserve freedom. This isn't politics, these are real lives. And I'm just a dude who gives a fuck about humanity. I stand with the people of Palestine.\" In January, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters descended on Sundance to share their message, and Pose actor Indya Moore was among them. Chants rang out, including calls to \"Free Palestine\" and \"Stop the genocide,\" according to the Hollywood Reporter. Over a microphone, Indya said:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gay as \u2014 God forgive me \u2014 fuck. I love everybody. I love people. I have Israeli friends. I have Jewish friends. I have Palestinian friends. Everybody sees what\u2019s happening. They all agree, there needs to be a ceasefire. Stop telling us to hate each other. Stop telling us they hate each other. They also know that the Palestinian children that have been murdered are not responsible for freeing the hostages right now. That\u2019s just the truth, right? The children are innocent.\u201d Indya Moore was not the only actor to make an appearance at the previously mentioned demonstration. They were joined by former Scream actor Melissa Barrera, who was recently fired from Scream 7\u00a0after referring to the happenings in Gaza as \"genocide,\" \"ethnic cleansing,\" and \"like a concentration camp.\" In response to her firing, Spyglass, the company behind\u00a0Scream 7's production, released the following statement: \u201cSpyglass\u2019 stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech.\"\u00a0 Since then, the film's director and costar Jenna Ortega have dropped from production.\u00a0 Poor Things actor Ramy Youssef was among many artists who sported ceasefire pins at the 2024 Oscars. When asked about it, he told Variety: \u201cWe\u2019re calling for immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza. We\u2019re calling for peace and lasting justice for the people of Palestine. It\u2019s a universal message of, \u2018Let\u2019s stop killing kids. Let\u2019s not be part of more war.\u2019 No one has ever looked back at war and thought a bombing campaign was a good idea. To be surrounded by so many artists who are willing to lend their voices, the list is growing. A lot of people are going to be wearing these pins tonight. There\u2019s a lot of talking heads on the news, this is a space of talking hearts. We\u2019re trying to have this big beam to humanity.\u201d Actress and long-time activist Susan Sarandon was dropped by her talent agency after making an appearance at a pro-Palestine rally, where she said, \u201cThere are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.\u201d Further, \"There\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s happened where antisemitism has been confused with speaking up against Israel.\u00a0I am against antisemitism. I am against Islamophobia.\u201d She has since apologized after her words were viewed as anti-Semitic.\u00a0"},{"author":"Hannah Dobrogosz","title":"People Are Bravely Sharing The Most Embarrassing And Humbling Moments They've Ever Had, And It's Hard Not To Giggle","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/hannahdobro\/funny-embarrassing-stories","description":"\"He stood up in the cart, turned around to look at me, and declared, 'No, Dad!

We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility.\" HuffPost Writer I was settling in for an interview over Zoom when I glanced at my baby monitor and saw it: the unmistakable wiggle of a toddler who\u2019d pooped himself awake from a nap. I sighed and set the monitor aside. I had no choice but to wait till after the call to check on him. When the Zoom ended, I dashed in to clean him up, then texted my friend a photo of the three of us (my baby, myself and my laptop). \u201cLook at me,\u201d I wrote wryly. \u201cI have it all.\u201d I started thinking a lot about \u201chaving it all\u201d after my son was born in late 2021. I went back to work after four months of parental leave, breast-pumping my way through phone calls and changing diapers on the sly. I loved being close to my son and was lucky to have a husband who thrived as a stay-at-home dad, but it was all so completely exhausting. For every stolen midday snuggle there was sobbing (on both sides of the door) when I had to close my eyes and tune out my son\u2019s cries for Mommy as I buckled down to get a project done.\u00a0 Surely, I often thought to myself, this isn\u2019t what Helen Gurley Brown had in mind when she published \u201cHaving It All,\u201d her famed book of advice on balancing sex, work, relationships and more, in 1982. I may have a career and a family, but I often \u201chave it all\u201d \u2014 or, rather, do it all \u2014 at the exact same time.\u00a0 In the summer of 2012, just a couple of years into my journalism career, The Atlantic published Anne-Marie Slaughter\u2019s culture-defining text, \u201cWhy Women Still Can\u2019t Have It All.\u201d In it, she described stepping back from powerful government work to be closer to home and more available to her two teenage sons, and she outlined the workplace changes she saw as necessary to allow ambitious women to pursue big careers and remain present mothers.\u00a0 I read it hungrily, feeling smug about my own ambivalence toward motherhood. At 25, I was climbing the career ladder fast and loving it. Why derail the train with a baby when the ride was so exciting? Plus, I couldn\u2019t imagine a world where Slaughter\u2019s proposed changes \u2014 more flexible schedules, remote work, less business travel, teleconferencing instead of in-person meetings \u2014 would materialize. Little did I know a global pandemic would abruptly shift that tide. A decade later, in a post-COVID world, I had, in many ways, exactly what Slaughter had described: an exciting career with a flexible, remote job that allowed me to be close to the baby I\u2019d decided I wanted. But I also had a hefty dose of burnout. For me, it was all too much \u2014 the constant doing it all. And I was losing my ambition as a result.\u00a0 I\u2019m not the first millennial mom with an office job to feel this way. Between lazy girl jobs, the death of the girlboss\u00a0and the countless ambitious women who\u2019ve written about losing their drive in recent years, the collapse of millennial women\u2019s ambition is well-documented. Heck, we now even have the millennial mom midlife crisis.\u00a0 But it\u2019s no wonder: Millennial moms work more than previous generations of mothers,\u00a0and we spend more time parenting our kids, plus our parents can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to help us out (or need care themselves). And then there\u2019s the astronomical cost of child care. We are at capacity all the time, even with the trappings of professional flexibility.\u00a0 I decided to ask Anne-Marie Slaughter what comes next. Slaughter acknowledged that we\u2019ve made strides toward her envisioned workplace, but we\u2019re not there yet.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ve transitioned the where we can work, and we have the flexibility \u2014 so now, if your kid is sick or you have a teacher\u2019s conference or you need to take a parent to a doctor\u2019s appointment, you have the flexibility to do that,\u201d she said. But we haven\u2019t reached the place where professional and personal ambition can coexist. Aside from major structural changes we know are needed to support families \u2014 such as 12 months of parental leave, plentiful and affordable child care, free pre-kindergarten and well-funded public schools \u2014 there is one big thing that needs to change in the workplace, according to Slaughter: management practices. Face time is still the reigning tool for performance measurement, and that disadvantages anyone working remotely. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the office and that other person is in the office, you are still going to have a better sense that they are working than the person who is not [in the office],\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve said for a long time, to really make this work, you have to have much more objective and precise management practices, and that takes more work. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d Indeed, McKinsey\u2019s Women in the Workforce reports from both 2022 and 2023 found that women in leadership are leaving their roles in record numbers, in part because their labor isn\u2019t being recognized by their superiors. They\u2019re taking on diversity, equity and inclusion work or heading up employee resource groups in addition to their full-time roles, for example, but it\u2019s not being counted toward their overall performance, and they\u2019re working remotely (often to juggle family responsibilities), which is being counted against them.\u00a0 \u201cThey are looking for the ability to advance. They are looking for flexibility and choice in terms of where, when and how they work. They are looking for companies that authentically prioritize DE&I. They are looking for people who are backing their careers,\u201d said McKinsey senior partner Lareina Yee in a podcast about the 2022 report. But, quite frankly, she said, \u201ccompanies haven\u2019t stepped up.\u201d Beyond changes in performance evaluation and management, Slaughter also advocates for what she described in her Atlantic article as \u201cinvestment intervals,\u201d the idea that you grind hard in certain periods of your work life \u2015 early in your career before you have kids, for example \u2015 and then make different choices as your career moves forward, including saying no to promotions that won\u2019t work for your family life or taking time off from full-time work to consult, take a sabbatical or accept project-based work. Then when your kids are grown, you can lean back in and keep rising. In my view, when it comes to frazzled millennial moms, a wholesale shift in the way we understand and reward professional ambition is due. Forget this idea that moving up, down, back or sideways in your career is a sign that you\u2019re not committed. Instead, we must think of ambition as a tide \u2014 sometimes rolling in, sometimes rolling out, always doing its part. Under this rubric, millennial moms aren\u2019t losing their ambition, they\u2019re simply moving with the tide, and there\u2019s no reason to feel ashamed about that. We shouldn\u2019t be sent back to square one in our careers simply because the tide of our ambition went out while our children needed us most. Slaughter said that taking a break to have kids or to work on professional development isn\u2019t the kiss of death that it used to be, but \u201cthere are still plenty of workplaces where, if you get knocked off that straight-up path, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard to get back on. I can see it changing; it just hasn\u2019t changed yet.\u201d\u00a0 At her company, New America, Slaughter said she\u2019s found that a flexible and supportive culture, which includes hybrid work, paid parental leave and a \u201cfamily comes first\u201d mantra, has ensured the work always gets done without sacrificing people\u2019s personal lives and has also helped more junior staff find opportunities to rise and be seen. Parental leave, for example, \u201ccreates opportunities for other people, younger people, other members of the team\u201d to step in and work with Slaughter and other senior staff who they might not have otherwise crossed paths with directly. \u201cIt builds resilience in the workplace.\u201d Slaughter sees millennial and Gen Z workers rejecting the old hustle-culture model and applauds it, but also notes that many of us aren\u2019t sure where to go from here. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that the world that we knew is coming apart in many ways, and people are not sure what they should be wanting,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they know that the traditional whatever it was that was going to make you happy is not likely to.\u201d\u00a0 That said, she thinks the idea of striving to be a \u201cwhole, healthy person\u201d is a move in the right direction. \u201cBy whole, I really do mean having different dimensions to your life. That could be work and family, that could be sports, hobbies, friendships.\u201d\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t even use the phrase \u201chaving it all\u201d anymore. \u201cThe whole framing makes me uncomfortable, even though that is the phrase I grew up with that meant having a career and a family,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a hyper-capitalist dimension to it\u201d that runs counter to the way most millennials and Gen Zers think about their lives. It\u2019s time we tossed it for good and focused on building workplaces that support the multidimensional lives of all workers. As for our millennial mom midlife crises and waning ambition? Slaughter advises us all to hang in there.\u00a0 \u201cIt is a life passage that many, many, many people go through. We are maturing into our fuller selves who realize that there\u2019s more to life and there\u2019s more to ambition. I have plenty of ambition. It\u2019s just not expressed in the way that it once was, to climb to the top of a particular ladder.\u201dThis article originally appeared on HuffPost."},{"author":"Elizabeth Cotton","title":"\"I Don't Want Him In The Delivery Room\" \u2014 This Woman Only Wants Her Husband Present After She's Given Birth, Let's Discuss","url":"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/elizabeth_cotton\/woman-doesnt-want-husband-in-same-room-during-birth-aita","description":"\"BIRTH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT.\"View Entire Post \u203a","date":"2024-06-13T10:03:02Z","content":"\"BIRTH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT.\" BuzzFeed Staff BTW: Am I The Asshole is a discussion page on Reddit where users ask for advice on whether or not they are the asshole in the situation.\u00a0 \"I have talked to him about it several times since the first birth.

BuzzFeed Staff  \"Four and a half years on [testosterone] here. I\u2019ve always been boyish, so my friend group and fashion sense stayed the same. The main change I noticed was how others treated me. I get asked to help move stuff more and don\u2019t get told to 'smile more' or get leered at by strangers, which is such a blessing I didn\u2019t even consider.  Physically, I\u2019m stronger, my proportions changed, and my feet grew and height increased. T didn\u2019t make me aggressive, just very *excitable*. Overall, I am so damn happy I made the decision to transition, no matter if people have negative opinions on my identity. I am loved and cherished still, and my mental health has skyrocketed over the last four years.\" \u2014witchystar55 \"FTM, transitioned at 19. To be honest, I haven\u2019t noticed that much difference in how people treat me. The biggest difference is that HRT has made my emotions a lot steadier, and I\u2019m way more confident. It\u2019s also weirdly difficult to cry \u2014apparently, it has something to do with hormones changing your tear ducts.\" \u2014wes7887 \"I transitioned from female to male, and the biggest physical differences I've noticed are in how my body processes being cold and needing to pee. Before, when I was in either of those situations, they felt IMMEDIATE and UNBEARABLE. Being on testosterone makes them both things where I'm like, 'I should deal with that at some point,' but it doesn't need to be NOW.\u00a0 Also, people like to talk about how much more rational men's clothing sizes are, but I haven't found that to be true at all. A 31-inch waist fits me very differently in different brands and even different styles in the same brand.\" \u2014anonymous \"A lot of my friends have completely forgotten that I\u2019m not a cis male and will talk\/joke about certain things. And when I bring up something from my past about being raised a girl or not having a dick, they are dumbfounded, trying to rack their brain around how that\u2019s possible, LOL.\" \u2014anonymous \"Trans man here. I am honestly so shocked by how much easier life is for me now that I\u2019m fully passing. I\u2019m treated with so much more respect, and I no longer feel unsafe in most public areas. I don\u2019t know if this is the same for every trans man, but I really do feel that now I am a man, the world feels structured to benefit me entirely. I\u2019m not inherently happy about this, obviously. I\u2019m just constantly reminded of how truly awful life can be for women.\" \u2014anonymous \"I am treated completely differently [than] before my transition. To everyone, I was just one of those girls that always hung out with the boys. A major tomboy. Once I started hormones, I felt more like myself, and finally, everyone was able to start seeing who I saw all along. It was much harder before I passed. For those who don't know, 'passing' is when a trans person is seen as a cis person. Once I started passing, I was more welcome into male spaces.\u00a0 Very few people at my current workplace know my trans status. I am seen as a cis male consistently for the first time in my life. It opened me up to a world of guy talk, which is wild. I honestly thought guy talk was a made-up thing in movies. But it's real, and I'm here to tell you that there are certain things men will not say in 'mixed company.' After being at my workplace for almost two years, it doesn't faze me anymore.\" \u2014anonymous \"I'm over 30 and out as FtM for three years. I absolutely love that strangers are no longer asking and judging me about kids ('Do you have any\/why not\/when\/who's gonna take care of you later?'). I also feel much more self-assured, nobody is second-guessing my technical competence (I work in IT), and as an extension, I am not second-guessing myself, either. I genuinely feel much more at ease and comfortable, and I'm happier. I also don't hesitate to speak up for either myself or others, and interestingly, I've become much less tolerant of misogyny and sexism in general.\" \u2014anonymous \"This may be silly \u2014 or just plain obvious \u2014 but the men\u2019s restroom is almost always in worse condition than the women\u2019s restroom. I\u2019ve seen unspeakable things stuffed in toilets, smeared on walls, and pooled at the bottom of stalls. It reminds me of that saying, 'You never know what you have until it\u2019s gone.' I miss relatively clean public restrooms, but I am also way too dysphoric-ly stubborn to use the women's outside of absolute emergencies.\" \u2014anonymous \"Cis men really don't seem to wash their hands in bathrooms, at ALL.\" \u2014anonymous \"I was assigned female at birth and began transitioning in my early 20s. I began 'passing' as a straight, cisgender male and noticed how I felt safe walking alone. People didn't bother me as much. I noticed that when I did group assignments, people would listen to me more and talk over me less. This all sparked a lot of feelings inside me, and it helped me work through a lot of internalized misogyny. If it hasn't already been done, someone needs to write a paper on the difference in culture between the men's and women's restrooms. The men's room is generally a mess, and eye contact or quick greetings seem forbidden. I miss the camaraderie of the women's room all the time \u2014 the sharing of tampons, a quick heads-up if the toilet paper is low, and a shoulder to cry on during a drunken meltdown. Now it's one stall that's being used by someone watching YouTube loudly on their phone and Zyn pouches lining the urinals. Love it.\" \u2014anonymous \"I transitioned from female to male. There are a lot of differences, but one I did not expect is that \u2014 before I passed as a man \u2014 I would offer car rides home to strange women my age I saw walking on the road in my town, especially in the cold winter. Now that I pass as a man, I feel as though they would immediately assume I intended something bad (understandable from their position), so I just keep driving and hope they get home safe. The instant solidarity and connection I formerly experienced with women is not as readily experienced with men. I had to come out as gay to my managers at work just to get them to stop teasing me for 'flirting' with the female receptionist my age, whom I'm friends with outside of work. Literally cannot be friends with women or go out to dinner with them without everyone assuming we're a couple.\" \u2014anonymous \"I'm transitioning FtM and passing most of the time. Women, when talking about reproductive issues or periods, pat my knee and say, 'You don't have to worry about that.' Doctors take me more seriously. I get fewer smiles back on the street. Uber and Lyft drivers don't try to make small talk, which I love. I still get clocked on the phone, and it's wild how condescending people are.\" \u2014anonymous \"I've never experienced the men vs. women part; it's more that before I transitioned, I was catcalled a lot. [Now that I've] transitioned, I get left alone, which is lovely. The downside was I got a lot of harassment: things thrown at me by strangers in the street, threats, being filmed and harassed. I've also faced discrimination when applying for jobs.\" \u2014anonymous \"I've noticed quite a few differences. As a woman, men paid unwanted attention to me. When I corrected them, they'd laugh it off claiming it was harmless. If I needed help, men would come do it for me as opposed to showing me how best to do a job, or just assisting the extra muscle I may need.\" \u2014anonymous \"I am a transgender man who transitioned about 10 years ago. The first thing I noticed right away, especially being more of an opinionated 'nerd' type, is that I no longer had to bring backup to a discussion. I didn't have to google things to prove I was right about something. People just listened to me and believed me when I said things. It was a whiplash! Not that everything I say is always right, but people would actually engage with it instead of just being like, 'Oh, sweetie, you don't know what you're talking about.' Just in general, people treated me like I was another person on the same level and not in an infantilizing way. I did mourn the loss somewhat of not being seen as a threat to women, though. I felt like I lost the ability to communicate with women my age without them being guarded or suspicious, but I don't blame them at all. I was taught to do the exact same thing.\" \u2014anonymous \"FtM: Far less emotion (haven't cried in 15 years), far more body hair. :P\u00a0 One thing that stands out was that when I was dining out with my ex-husband (not ex yet then, obviously), pre-transition, they would automatically give him the bill, and as soon as they clocked me as male, they asked if we wanted to split. Women are more weary of me now, I feel less comfortable complimenting both men and women for how that might come across, people don't interrupt me nearly as often now, and I feel like I'm taken more seriously, even if I'm spewing the same bullshit.\" \u2014anonymous \"I transitioned FtM nine years ago. One thing I will notice about the 'men vs. women' environments is that it is so much less scary in the world passing as a man. Men leave me alone or say, 'What\u2019s up man?' whereas when I was a girl, I was terrified to walk down the street. I feel very lucky to be who I am, but I think the world has a lot to learn. Trans people are just people. That\u2019s it.\" \u2014anonymous \"I\u2019ve applied to jobs under my dead name and birth gender and never got a call back or any kind of acknowledgment that they received it. Applied to the same jobs as my new name and current gender and moved on to the interviewing process so fast.\" \u2014anonymous \"I transitioned MtF. One of the biggest differences was how small I started to feel. Taking hormones, shrinking muscles, and always being scared of what people are thinking about you and how you look. I'm 6 ft., but I would feel tiny when out with people.\" \u2014anonymous \"Men started opening doors for me, which I'm happy for now that I\u2019ve lost my boy strength; I had to relearn basic tasks like opening heavy doors. Men are much more likely to help me with physically difficult things, warn me something is heavy, and unfortunately, mansplain and give unnecessary help with non-physical tasks. I\u2019ve had a few gas station clerks ask for my number, or say I\u2019m pretty and ask if I have a boyfriend. Ewwphoria at first. It quickly got old. Women are much more friendly and willing to help me, like offering to stand guard while I use a public restroom that won\u2019t lock if I do the same for her or help me push my car out of a parking space when it wouldn\u2019t start. Now they usually make eye contact and smile as we pass each other; I didn\u2019t realize before just how separated these two genders are in public, but now I\u2019m finally joining the half of the population that I should have been with from the start. Physically, the changes estrogen made to my body and mind feel absolutely wonderful. There are things I didn\u2019t expect, like my feet shrinking and having to buy smaller shoes, and my thighs and butt getting too big even to pull my men\u2019s pants up all the way, never mind buttoning them. I\u2019m so glad my body odor smell changed for the better and is rarely even present; I can easily skip a shower or even two. Sunscreen is more important than ever, though, as is eating healthy if I want to feel well and stay in shape. And the loss of strength, wow\u2026it was true what I heard about thinking you know what to expect, but being surprised when it happens; nothing could have prepared me. I struggled to enter a building a few times because opening doors isn\u2019t even the same.\" \u2014slaughterdog \"I definitely can tell I am treated like less of a person after transitioning. I am MtF, and my ideas [are ignored], but then when a male says the same thing, they listen.\" \u2014anonymous \"I was a professional in the finance industry for eight years and was a senior member of my department and seen as a subject matter expert before I came out and began transitioning (MtF). My workplace was quite progressive and supportive, but when I changed my name and started using she\/her pronouns, I noticed an immediate change in the way customers treated me. My expertise in my field was suddenly second-guessed or questioned where I was the authority before.\" \u2014anonymous \"Interestingly, my son told me I'm a far better mom than I ever was a dad!\" \u2014anonymous \"As a trans woman, I have noticed that clothes shopping has become a lot more fun, and I am starting to notice that I am starting to be attracted to both men and women.\" \u2014anonymous \"I'm genderfluid and recently had top surgery. I do dress pretty femme most of the time, but the fact that everyone seems to think that I still have to cover my chest even though there are no breasts there anymore has me baffled! I literally have the same chest as a FtM person, but because I present femme, it's inappropriate. So weird!\" \u2014chaoswitch \"I feel infinitely better in terms of my overall wellbeing. While dysphoria often can be related to your personal feelings about your body, people often underestimate the impact of social dysphoria: the distress caused not by your body image but by being constantly misidentified in public. It was so depressing always being called 'ma\u2019am' in public no matter how I dressed or acted. I just was never read as male until I started testosterone, and it\u2019s really nice not having people\u2019s incorrect assumptions thrown in my face all the time.\u00a0 One BIG thing I\u2019ve noticed that I haven\u2019t seen discussed much is the difference in how people treat you when they view you as a gender-nonconforming man vs. a gender-nonconforming woman. Before being on testosterone, I was always read as a butch lesbian, and now I\u2019m read as a femme man. When people thought I was a butch lesbian, I was frequently treated with hostility, but that hostility was generally less overtly threatening. While I now am the beneficiary of male privilege, I\u2019m also physically threatened and publicly harassed a lot more for being gender-nonconforming. I would get stares and under-the-breath comments before, whereas now I get open threats, yelled slurs, and loud comments intimating a desire to commit violence far more often. While I don\u2019t want to downplay the negative experiences people read as butch women receive, I have observed that straight men are a lot more threatened by \u2014 and feel that they have more justification for being violent toward \u2014 effeminate men (and trans women) than people they read as butch cis women.\" \u2014anonymous \"I will say that one of my experiences as a mixed-race nonbinary trans man is that my treatment has gotten a lot worse than when people thought I was a woman. I am Choctaw and Iraqi, and now that I am perceived as a man, I often face an increase in racism. Which is depressing stuff, for sure! So let me tell you about the positives. My father accepted me immediately. After I came out as trans, he came out as bisexual. We've gone to Pride together multiple times and are able to be ourselves without fear when we're with each other.\u00a0 My boyfriend and I can share a closet. I have saved so much money on my wardrobe, it's incredible. And in regards to my boyfriend, he has been sweet, compassionate, and understanding beyond belief.\u00a0 When I got on testosterone, my body stopped hurting. For most of my life, I was a survivor of chronic pain and fatigue. When I got on T, both of them went away. I talked to my doctor, and we did some tests. It turns out that for most of my life, I suffered from a hormone imbalance caused by aromatase deficiency. Getting on T literally made my life easier. It also led to me getting tested and finding out that I am intersex, which is something I hold with a lot of pride.

Instead, the temperatures Down Under have him rugged up. #stitch with @alexandratuohey  It's almost winter in Australia, which means most of us will have to contend with houses colder on the inside than temps are outside.  The World Health Organization consistently ranks Australian homes as some of the coldest in the world. For a home to be considered \"warm\" it must be above 18\u2103 inside. Yet studies have shown 81% of Aussie houses fail to meet that minimum standard.  \ud83e\udd76 Tasmania fared worst, with homes averaging 11 degrees during the winter.  \ud83d\ude30 Over a quarter of Victorian homes fell below 14 degrees.  \u2603\ufe0f And for any Queenslanders, sorry but the report didn't survey your homes (even though, yes, I know they can get brutally cold too).  But this isn't just an excuse to complain. It's actually a health and safety issue. Colder homes are dangerous for elderly and at-risk populations, increasing likelihood of hypothermia and potentially death. Lower temperatures are also perfect for mould and rising damp.  As climate change impacts weather around the world, issues like these are going to become even more apparent. Regulation, while long overdue, must now be fast-tracked to prevent the worst of outcomes.  #aussielife #aussiewinter #worldhealthorganization #australia #melbournelife @Jordie van den Berg  A report from last year even showed that 81% of Aussie houses had an internal temperature of less than 18 degrees celsius.

She was pretty, smart, and loving. I also thought this would be a short relationship, but it lasted longer than I thought. I had no plan and no idea what to do to get out of it. Feeling the pressure from my parents and hers, I eventually asked her to marry. I didn't know what else to do.\u00a0 It was terrifying. I couldn't see my future past the current day. Sex was atrocious. I had become the expert on giving every excuse in the book as to why I couldn't or didn't want to. It started weighing heavily on her, but she never became suspicious. She assumed something was wrong with her and it really started to affect her. I felt like an asshole.\u00a0 One night, after three years of being married, she asked for intimacy, and I gave my 1,092nd excuse as to why I didn't want to. That was it. She had cried before, but this time, she couldn't stop. Crying uncontrollably. Thinking she was the problem. God, it was terrible. I couldn't take it anymore and at 4 in the morning that night I came out to her. It all made sense to her, and I literally watched the weight of the world lift from her shoulders. It was the best night and worst night of my life. I came out, but I was going to lose my best friend.\u00a0 We separated and eventually got a divorce. I wanted to make sure she was going to be okay and paid for her therapy and paid all of her debt off. I felt like I owed her a lot. Fast forward 10 years later, and she and I are good friends. We can talk about the days past, and she holds no grudge. She remarried, had some kids, and is really enjoying life. I, too, found a partner and am very happy and feel liberated. Looking back, had I been strong enough to come out, none of that would have happened. But things happen for a reason, I believe. I have the utmost admiration for those who come out early and aren't afraid to be who they are.

We were hesitant at first, but the quality of the photos taken thru this wasn\u2019t skewed at all. It didn\u2019t leave water drop marks, and very easy to click the buttons through the plastic cover! Very resistant to water, and was still able to use face recognition and finger ID.\" \u2014Brittany & Phillip Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 14 colors).

I kid you not. This thing keeps drinks cold like that's its job (because it is). Once I got mine and saw how effective it was, I decided all of my cold beverage-loving friends and family would be getting one, also.\u00a0With most of my friends being Michelob Ultra and White Claw drinkers, this seems to be the perfect fit. So hard to find a can Koozie that holds those slim cans! Love this product and definitely recommend!\" \u2014Brooke Price Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in three sizes and 30 colors).

Promising review: \"We bought this after renting one on vacation. It is compact to carry and super easy to set up once you figure it out. My husband needed a hand the first time but now can set it up alone in five minutes. I love it because it is quick and easy to adjust when the sun shifts throughout the day, and it provides a larger shade area for my kids to play. There is some noise when the wind is strong, but it didn't bother us at all.\" \u2014Katie Young Get it from Amazon for $290.

It's literally the best thing ever for the sun.\" \u2014Hayley Place Get it from Shadey Attachments on Etsy for $17.29 (available in seven colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I highly recommend buying these beach chairs. After scouring Amazon for weeks looking for the perfect beach chairs for our vacation, I stumbled upon these. They were cheaper than most beach chairs so I was a little nervous. I ordered two anyway. When they arrived, I was thrilled!! They are compact, easy to set up, and comfortable to sit in. They also have a built-in cup holder that is very handy!

No more fly-away towels!\" \u2014BeckiCaesar Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $5.99. Promising review: \"This is probably my new favorite beach\/camping accessory. Well worth the money and love the teal color. When I posted pics online, my friends all wanted to know where I got it. The insulated bottom fits much more than I expected it to. I think I got like six cans of beer, four juice boxes, four sandwiches, and some grapes and ice too. I suggest filling the cooler up before the bag. I like the side pockets, too. I was able to fit my book, glasses, and phone with room to spare. On the inside, I packed dry food and four rolled-up towels. The large straps made it easy to carry down to the beach. The bottom leaked a little ice water at the top, but it was at the zipper, and because I had it packed so full. I plan to use this for school sporting events and picnics too.\"\u2014Stacia Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in three colors).

She loved it and looked comfortable so I bought two more to use at the beach. We used it at the beach, and it was so much more comfortable than laying on a blanket. We usually have chairs, but you cannot lie on your stomach in the chairs. We had to park a block away and they were easy to carry with the strap as they're not heavy. It is very sturdy, and I love the hole so your face is out, and you can read a magazine or book while on your stomach without hurting your neck! Very easy to fold and unfold, no issues!\"\u00a0\u2014blondietw Get it from Amazon for $58.61+\u00a0(available in nine colors and two versions).\u00a0 Promising review: \"These are made of lightweight plastic, not the heavy thick type I was expecting. However, don't be fooled. They are AWESOME! They fly straight and far. THESE ALSO FLOAT. I bought them to take to the\u00a0beach. Someone else at the\u00a0beach\u00a0warned us as we played with them that they had lost their disc in the ocean. Ours floated, though, so we had no problems.\u00a0We even started a new game where we threw it into the surf and then tried to be the first one to find where it washed up.

Promising review: \"This is an amazing speaker for traveling or going to the\u00a0beach. It's portable, and you can hang it so it doesn't get dirty with sand or dust around you. It is very useful for hiking because it is light, which makes it easy to carry as you can see in the picture. The battery life is really good. I've used it three times and still doesn't need to charge, so it's about 10 hours of music.

Our toddler has very long hair and loves to wear anything that resembles what her older sisters are wearing. We figured we might as well buy her a hat that's super cute and functional.

Promising review: \"Every busy family needs this. We use it to carry our sports equipment, beach gear, and even our two young kids (1- and 3-years-old). The wheels are very sturdy. We've used it over grass and gravel, and it rolls without issue. The handle also extends out and it locks securely in place when not used.

Finally something to keep the laundry detergent drips off the floor and washing machine.\u00a0This keeps the cup right where it needs to be and protects your equipment, walls, and floors from drips.

It also just looks so darn cute (and comes in so many colors that I'm tempted to buy another!).\" Promising review: \"What's not to love? The color and fabric is both beautiful and a nice quality of velvet. It is easy to assemble, attach the legs and you are done. It is sturdy and does not wobble.

Need more in my life.\" \u2014Joan Rodriguez \"I got this for my minimalist husband who hates getting 'things' for gifts, almost as much as he hates clutter. He was practically giddy after we installed several of these on various kitchen appliances. It\u2019s not just storage \u2014 but moving the appliance around from its storage location to the countertop is a nicer experience. He was seriously swinging around a food processor with one hand saying 'this is so much neater!' To each their own I suppose. For us normies, it does exactly what it\u2019s supposed to. Easy to stick on, I like that it holds the plug neatly as well. I would love if it came in white, but the gray is a nice neutral.\" \u2014Elizabeth L.\u00a0 Get a two-pack from Amazon for $10.95.

I've gone to the dryer so many times to find my sheets and blankets in a balled-up type blob. I have to unwrap everything and start the dryer again since it is all damp still...and usually had to repeat this another time to finally have the items dried. Wasting so much electricity for a number of drying cycles. The first time I used this product, it alleviated this issue. Everything was dry and not balled up. Fantastic product!

Usually, it takes me a good 15\u201320 minutes at least to achieve somewhat of a soft heal. Enter this, it took me five minutes tops. I\u2019ve never had softer feet!

Intimate Rose is a small biz creating wellness products, like dilators, weights, supplements, and more that help treat issues and pain related to the pelvic floor.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Since starting, my bladder control has significantly improved. I am now able to sneeze or cough without peeing myself. Yes, that's right. I am able to hold my pee longer, which means I can actually make it to the bathroom without dribbling on myself. The best part is that just a few short weeks into the program you will have results you can feel. I think every woman who has ever had kids should try this, out. The overall quality of my life has improved. Ditch your panty liners, stop the embarrassing dribbles, no more dashes to the restroom because of a weak bladder. Even my sex life has improved; I have control of those pelvic muscles now. Just remember to wash the weights before and after each use with an antibacterial spray, and allow time to air dry before putting them away. I say air dry because if you wipe them dry with a cloth you run the risk of giving yourself a bladder infection or urinary tract infection, and those are no laughing matter. Easy to use, easy to clean, stores away quickly.\" \u2014Lady Tauber Get a set of six weights from Amazon for $49.99. Promising review:\u00a0\"Embarrassingly Gross.

Promising review: \"I'm actually a dentist who often has bad breath, which is not a good combination. My oral hygiene is great (tongue scraping, brushing, flossing, etc.), but I have\u00a0allergies\u00a0and constantly have a bit of post-nasal drip, which contributes to the bad breath. While this stuff isn't perfect, and my breath doesn't stay fresh all day, it is definitely the longest-lasting product I have tried so far. It is the first thing I have tried that still gives me that minty feeling when I breathe deep 4\u20136 hours after using it. I've found that gargling and using the TheraBreath throat spray in addition to rinsing with this have greatly improved my breath.

Doctor Easy\u00a0started 20 years ago with the invention of the\u00a0Elephant Ear Washer by a doctor who saw the need for a better\u00a0method of treating patients\u2019 earwax impactions. The kit includes the washer bottle and three disposable tips. Using it is simple: Fill the bottle with your preferred ear cleaning solution, attach the disposable tip, and then spray the cleaner into your ear. This will loosen up wax and cause it to basically just fall right out of your ear!  Promising review: \"This thing is amazing. It is one of those things that look so simple that you don't think it can possibly do any better than all the other things out there. But it does. After going to a hot spring, my right ear was plugged up. I tried various oily ear cleaners; I went to the doctor who tried a syringe and peroxide; I tried using an ear cleaner bulb; I even tried jumping up and down with my head tilted. Nothing worked. Then, I got this little gadget and on the first try with just warm water, my ear was cleared. The sink looked like someone had puked in it, I am not kidding you. I did not think my ear could possibly hold that much junk in it. I can now hear whispers from across the room. I will be getting more tips for this sucker. And I am going to clean out my ears every month from now on!\" \u2014Thomas Wong Get it from Amazon for $31.95. Promising review:\u00a0\"Folks. Buy it.\u00a0This is like head lice treatment. If you are looking at it and thinking about it, YOU NEED IT.\u00a0And this stuff. Is. Awesome. Literally chunks of ear wax came out of my ear holes the SIZE OF CORN KERNELS. Where was this coming from? Why is my body making so much wax? Where was it being stored, because I did NOT think ear canals were that spacious, but apparently there are some storage closets in there or something because HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD the ear nuggets are real.\u00a0My ears feel so squeaky clean!\u00a0And get this, my hair makes sounds. Like I put it up in a hair tie afterward, and I could HEAR MY HAIR MOVING ON MY HEAD. What is that?! Seriously?!

Parents, please supervise as some of the smaller pieces might be a choking hazard. Promising review: \"I've seen a lot of wooden food cutting sets over the years, but this one is the best by far. First of all, the pieces connect by magnet rather than velcro. The Velcro sets tend to stop sticking once they've been used for a while. This one has well-made and sturdy pieces with some unique pieces like dragon fruit and spring onion. My personal favorite is the grapes, which can be pulled off the vine in groups of two (too big to choke on) and stuck back together. It also comes with a cutting board, two knives, and a little vegetable peeler. My 3-year-old loves this set and has been playing with it over and over.

My kiddos are being so creative finding things. My son found a compact mirror and breathed on it to steam it up for 'steamy.' Hooray for igniting thinking skills. Grandma gets involved finding silly things that make the kids crack up. I love the bag they come in and that it\u2019s a compact card game that can be played anywhere.\" \u2014Jami Lilo Get it from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: \"A must-have.

When we finish painting we put the kids on and put them away, the paint hasn\u2019t dried out on us yet and they\u2019ve sat unused for a week at a time with a quarter inch of paint in them. My son gets so excited when he see us pulling these out. I would buy these again. We haven\u2019t had any spills with these but I think if you were to fill them up (a few inches) with more paint that you could have a spill.

From sun up to sun down he is ON.\u00a0Unfortunately, we don't have a yard and we can't always make it to the playground.\u00a0We picked this up for him hoping that it would help him get some of that energy out on days that we're stuck inside. We've had it for 8 months and it has been a lifesaver!\u00a0I was worried about it taking up too much space in the living room but it's not bad at all. It's wide enough for him to jump comfortably, but not big enough to be an eyesore or get in the way. When I catch him trying to climb on the couch or run around too wildly, I just give him a quick reminder to jump on his trampoline instead. It's a win for both of us since he has a safe place to let that energy out and I'm not scolding him because he's jumping on things he's not supposed to. He is about 40 lbs and 40 inches tall and he doesn't seem to be growing out of it anytime soon. It was easy to put together and has held up beautifully! It's never tipped over and we've never had any accidents with it. I am so thankful we picked this up for him because it helps keep all of us happy and sane.\"\u00a0\u2014Ana Get it from Amazon for $68.25.

All the kids loved it and we even got in on the fun for a few rounds. I can see this being very popular in our house on a regular basis. It's nice to get the kids up and active looking for it rather than just sitting playing a game. Countless people of all ages can play. When it was just the two older boys they timed themselves to see who could find it faster.

I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these??\u00a0Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"This was another one of my\u00a0TikTok\u00a0purchases!\u00a0I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth so thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazing!\u00a0My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use, and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard, those tiny bristles really get in there and if you push too hard you might be sore like I was.

It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home. These just feel so good on your lips! The flavors are very true to their name. They are pretty small though, so if you use it often it won\u2019t last long (which is another reason I have three of them), but for $4 each it is worth it.

Promising review: \"I live in an apartment complex full of little goblins people call children. They like to run up and down the sidewalk for no discernible reason yelling at the top of their lungs while their parents watch on in mild amusement drinking wine on their patio. Lovely family time, I guess. So, naturally, I put these on every window I could. And now my evenings are much quieter, without sacrificing the look of my apartment. They\u2019re easy to pull back during the day when the goblins are away and easy to cover when they emerge in the evenings. So I can just cover my windows and put on a movie and it\u2019s like they\u2019re not even there! These block out a lot of light and sound from the neighborhood and match my decor nicely.

My house feels so cozy now, just in time for the long winter season.\" \u2014G.S. \"These are so stunning I may just leave them up all year! I bought three strands and would honestly buy more if i needed them. I tested the waterproofing and they are definitely waterproof!

You won\u2019t be disappointed.\" \u2014Brooklyn Get it from Amazon for $19.99\u00a0(available in three sizes and nine colors). Promising review: \"Every single tea in this selection is beautiful! I even loved the lemon and orange and I do not like anything of an orange derivative because it always tastes artificial. This was absolutely lovely! The teas are very smooth and mellow, very flavor forward. No overwhelming acidity or bitterness \u2014 even if you're like me and forget to take the tea bag out! It's a proper cup of tea for each varietal. It came well packaged in a lovely box that is very giftable. This was a value that well exceeded the price. I HIGHLY recommend this selection of teas! I am ordering more for birthdays and such. And especially more for me! Get this!\" \u2014Shonda C. Get it from Amazon for $12.49. Promising review: \"So much to love about this kettle!...THIS Cosori product is sturdy and made well. It looks SO nice sitting out and we love that we can set the water temperature! I drink matcha tea each morning and my husband drinks coffee so filling the kettle, setting the temp is easy and accurate. The kettle beeps three times when the water is heated to your liking and then it shuts off which is nice. The weight of this beauty is very sufficient and the gooseneck pour is elegant and fun. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to get away from the bulky electric hot water kettles and have a great looking product sitting out on your counter.\" \u2014Chris Baum Get it from Amazon for $69.99\u00a0(available in three colors).

The lids fit perfectly and I\u2019m able to freeze soups and then put the big cubes into freezer bags for storage. They\u2019re soft silicone so it\u2019s really easy to get the frozen soup out of the container. This was a bargain for how well-made they are and how well they work. Saves the family time and money.\" \u2014Shelly Valladolid Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in three colors). Promising review: \"I saw this online and decided that I'm giving it a try. I have a hard time sleeping without feeling support around me. I toss and turn over 40 times per night according to my sleep app. I tried this hoping for the best and I will say, I slept like a baby for the first time in seven years. I put a pillow under each side to prop it up to make it cradle in more and I\u2019m in heaven. I'm 57 and have had a hard time dealing with the emptiness of divorce. Who needs a man when you\u2019ve got this to sleep in?\u00a0Purchase it! You won\u2019t regret it. And best of all, no one snoring next to me!

Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping editor Abby Kass says about it: \"I've been using a similar one for years, and I still swear by it. It's so much cheaper than buying microwave popcorn all the time, not to mention better for you. It's super easy to use and makes delicious popcorn in minutes. Plus, it's collapsible, so it won't take up a lot of room in your cabinet. You *can* use it as its own bowl, but it's usually pretty hot after coming out of the microwave, so I usually just transfer to another bowl so I don't have to wait for it to cool.\" Promising review: \"Absolutely amazing!

The remote control makes it very easy, and the flames and logs look amazingly real. The crackle of the fire can be turned on or off and can also be adjusted...low\/high. It sounds so real, I feel the need to put a fireplace screen up. This is an excellent product. No problems whatsoever. Opened the box and plugged it in. It\u2019s very hard to tell they are not real.

Check out a TikTok of the reading chair in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Amazing reading chair\/lounger. If you're one of those people who needs to change positions often while reading, this chair is the bomb. I leave a charging cord in the arm for my phone and headphones, slide out the foot, and grab whatever book I chucked under there. I can lay down, recline, sit straight, etc. with ease. The foot stool part, being collapsible and held up with thin bars, did kind of sink a little after awhile but nothing that makes the chair feel broken or look lopsided. It's a solid little guy and I plan on picking another one up eventually for another room I like to read in.\" \u2014Calvin Andrews Get it from Amazon for $239.99+ (available in five colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"Tired\/annoyed with constantly fixing and fidgeting with pillowcases while trying to sleep and get comfortable. Bought these because of the zipper functionality and I honestly don't think I'll ever buy another pillowcase without zippers. They're hardly noticeable too, which is something I was originally concerned with. Best quality after the zippers is the coolness of these. 'Cooler than the other side of the pillow' takes on new meaning with these things. This material's 'cool' just seems to be cooler than any other pillowcases we own.

Promising reviews: \"I thought the\u00a0hype\u00a0was just\u00a0hype, but this is the kitchen tool I didn't know I would love as much as I do. From frozen to cooked chicken while retaining more moisture than any other method I am used to using.\" \u2014Amanda T. \"If you're wondering if the\u00a0hype\u00a0about instant pots is legit, I'm here to tell you that it IS and you need one. It's really helped me since I frequently forget to thaw meat the night before. Also, being able to throw everything in and have a fantastic white chicken chili come out in less than an hour, is just ideal... It came with a little recipe booklet, as well as a cheat sheet of reference times for cooking, which is hugely helpful, since I don't always want to Google for every single thing I cook. It works as a slow cooker, pressure cooker, has a saute function, can cook rice, make yogurt, steam eggs, and basically anything else you want. It's been helpful for me because I've been able to branch out into different meats that I might not normally have the time or know-how to cook properly. If you're stressed about safety, this is reassuring because the directions are very clear, and it locks in. I was really freaked the first time I used it, and knew nothing about pressure cookers or Instant Pots at all the first day....Anyways, the amount of cupboard space this takes up is worth it, and if we had a bigger kitchen I would leave it out all the time on the counter. I love it THAT much.\" \u2014emrev Get it from Amazon for $89.95. Promising reviews: \"I'm a side sleeper and have a lot of neck problems.

My mom, who had been using this Supergoop stuff the whole time, got me a bottle of this cult-favorite for Christmas last year (moms do know best sometimes!!). I couldn't be happier with it!\u00a0A dime-size amount covers my entire face, because it's translucent it leaves absolutely no white cast, and 10 minutes after putting it on, my face just feels like I applied a little bit of a nice moisturizer or makeup primer, not anything that's grease-central, like sunscreen usually is.

They fold up so it's easy to tuck them away or hold at different angles. They lasted ALL day with intermittent use. Let me tell you, this gal does not like being hot and these things were a\u00a0lifesaver! While they did sometimes run out of mist faster than I'd like (but at a fair rate due to the water compartment size), even just having the fan blowing on me helped me from feeling sick. The three speed options were amazing and helped save the battery life. My whole family passed these around while standing in lines and everyone liked them.

I got to try this and to say I'm obsessed does not express how passionately in love I am with this freakin' foundation. Holy cow, put me on a subscription. This stuff is literally flawless, gorgeous, *chef's kiss* on. It's also surprisingly suuuuper lightweight, like, to the point where I forget it's on. Normally when I'm wearing a full face of makeup, I can't WAIT to wash it off because I can feel it on my face but with this, I have to force myself to wash it off cuz it's so comfortable on. When they say \"can't feel coverage\" they meant that. Oh and btw, I could win the award for world's oiliest skin. I'm a greasy gworl. I haven't found a foundation that keeps me as matte as this does. Look, idk what Urban Decay is into but this potion is truly magic. I have to see how it does on hot summer days and at the pool but so far, it does everything it says it will. Doesn't transfer and blurs my skin beautifully. The setting powder in this really works overtime at keeping me matte all day long. No oily skin by the end of the day with this, just the same flawless beat as I did in the morning. Love this so so much. Def in my top two and it's not two! Get it from\u00a0Sephora\u00a0or\u00a0Amazon\u00a0for $40 (available in 40 shades). Promising review: \"I had five awfully painful plantar warts on my foot for about four months. They were all about a 1\/4 inch apart on the ball of my foot and I had a massive one under my second toe. It was becoming hard to walk with how painful they were. This was a Hail Mary and it worked phenomenally. The gel coats well right where you apply it. It doesn\u2019t have an awful stench. I applied it every three to four days for a couple of weeks. I noticed the pain was less and less until I didn\u2019t notice any. Last night I was actually able to pull and peel the remains of the dead warts out!! Kinda gross, but kind of cool. Seriously, this product works. If you have annoying warts...this is the answer!!!\" \u2014CJ805 Get a kit with the gel and 12 patches from Amazon for $11.99\u00a0(available in three styles and in multipacks).

Promising review: \"TikTok has influenced me to purchase a lot and this has to be one of my absolute favorites!! It\u2019s a beautiful, glossy glow and not greasy at all!

If this is in your cart, do yourself a favor and buy it now!!\" \u2014GalacticSam Get it from Sephora for\u00a0$50\u00a0(available in two shades). Promising review: \"I have tried many eye masks through the years and was pleasantly surprised by this product. It's worth the hype. I'm a skincare junkie and have spent tens of thousands on skin products including LED red light masks, infrared saunas, and every new facial device that has come along including high end skincare and everything in between. I have eye bags and hollows for days and these do a phenomenal job at plumping and hydrating the under eye area while reducing the grocery bags. Great quality and quantity for the price. I will be repurchasing.\" \u2014Nvohpa88 Get 48 pairs from Amazon for\u00a0$29.95\u00a0(available in 6-, 24-, and 72-packs, and in four styles). Former BuzzFeed Shopping editor AnaMaria Glavan swears by this thing. She says, \"The glove is super comfortable and using it couldn\u2019t be more foolproof:\u00a0Just put it on and run your hands through your pet\u2019s fur. That\u2019s it! The silicone grooves pick up so much fur with ease. Like, my dog looks close to hairless. HOW is he shedding so much!?!? After a few runs, I found that I would have to remove fur from the glove before continuing (you can pick up the fur with your other hand or run the glove under some water \u2014 either works), but it\u2019s no biggie. The silicone actually makes it really easy to keep this clean. We got Rockie when he was 5, and he\u2019d been riddled with skin issues and allergies, so I was pretty nervous to use anything that could potentially aggravate his conditions. However! Not only does this *not* bother his skin, but he\u2026loves this. A lot. He starts snoring after exactly two run-throughs on his back. Also, his coat looks SO shiny after each use! TL;DR: This is one of those inexpensive add-ons that any pet owner should have on hand.\" Promising review: \"The cats are in heaven!!! We have four cats and bought this to try to cut down on shedding and hairballs. After having it for just a week, we never want to be without it. Even our antisocial cat comes up and begs for a pet when the glove comes out. The only thing that is not perfect on this glove is that I have smaller hands, and the glove is a little big, so my pinky doesn't stay where it should. But hey, if that's the only downside, we aren't going to complain. Long story short, if you love your pets, you will buy this glove as soon as possible.\" \u2014Doad64 Get it from Amazon for $8.99. Just make sure it's a bottle that can actually be squeezed, since this won't work with totally solid bottles. Promising reviews: \"Life-altering.\u00a0I will never fight with a pump bottle again. As soon as it gets difficult to pump anything out of any bottle, I will waste no time in 'flipping it.' I'm so glad someone created this. Upside-down bottles are such a small annoyance in life, but this simple solution really means a lot. 100% worth the price.\" \u2014Amazon Customer \"You need them! This was a genius idea! I hate having to flip the darn lotion bottle upside down when the pump doesn\u2019t reach the end and makes a mess. But now, this works so well I could not believe why I hadn\u2019t bought these before! It makes it so easy to squeeze out and they are reusable!\" \u2014Carmen B. Get a pack of two stands and six adapters from Amazon for $14.99\u00a0(also available in one- and six-packs and in two colors). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. It also comes from a Korean-owned brand! Promising review: \"This is the first lip oil I've ever used. Usually I avoid anything with oil because I have very sensitive and generally oilier skin, but I wanted to give this a try because I wanted something sheer and pretty for a natural makeup look. Probably the best purchase I've ever made!!! It's super sheer and looks fine on its own without any other makeup. The smell is delicious, and while the gloss dries and fades after about an hour or two without eating, the color stays all day! I did have to reapply after eating, but not after drinking water! I just wish it was bigger, it's a teeny bottle. Would definitely buy again!!\" \u2014Rachel Get it from Amazon for $12\u00a0(available in 14 shades and in multipacks). Check out a\u00a0TikTok about the snail mucin face masks.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I love this Cosrx sheet mask. When you take it out of the package it can be a little daunting. However, carefully separate the face mask and place it on your face. There is ample snail mucin on the mask. Not to disappoint! It feels cool once on your face and works amazingly. I also purchased the Cosrx moisturizer and hydrating serum and LOVE them both as well!

They're\u00a0also airtight, so the paint in them won't dry out if you don't finish up the paint in the pen all at once.\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"If you own or rent a place, you need these touch-up pens. All you have to do is put the paint in and touch up your little boo-boos...its really worth having.\" \u2014SNOWDIVA \"We were in the process of selling our house when I came across this product on TikTok. I bought it thinking its worth a try and it has been amazing! After doing the big touch-ups, I used this product anywhere we made scratches in the paint from moving furniture. It has been such a lifesaver! No more bringing out the buckets of paint and risk making a big mess! 100% worth it. I will note that to refill it you need to turn it counter clockwise and little pieces will break off when you do this but it does not mean the product is broken. It will still function as intended!\" \u2014Brooklyn Beaty Get a pack of two on Amazon for $14.99+\u00a0(also available in a five-pack).

Promising review: \"I bought this attachment because I live in Texas and I'm pregnant. I figured this would be a great way to beat the heat while waiting for baby. I love that it has two different attachments, one for coarse and one for fine shaved ice. The coarse one produced ice more like a snowcone. I will try the fine one soon and see how it turns out. This is a high quality attachment!\" \u2014Caitlin Robbins Get it from Amazon for $99.95.\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"Anyone with dark under eye probs like myself need to have a brightener! I used to spend $40 on Becca, but this one is better in my opinion!! It\u2019s very pigmented and covers blue hues in the corners of my eyes. It can be worn alone but I prefer it under my concealer. It blends incredibly well, it's very creamy, and easy to apply. It will probably last me six months \u2014 a little dab goes a long way. It\u2019s extremely buildable, too. I am just so in love. I\u2019m a sucker for saving money and this purchase just saved me over $30. I will recommend to all my friends and family. Just BUY it!\" \u2014Caitlin Newcomb \"Bought this after seeing an influencer use it on TikTok. This works really well. I can instantly see a difference when I use it under my eyes.

But this tongue scraper is by far above and beyond anything I have used in the past. The immediate results were disgusting, which in this case is a good thing ;-).

I spray my hair with a little bit of water, add a small amount of this to my hair, and I can literally see my curls come to life! It works well when I blow out and flat iron my hair too, I add this and my heat protectant and my hair comes out so smooth and soft! I also use it as an edge control since it does have some hold to it, very versatile product. And a little of the product goes a LONG way!\" \u2014Marie G. Get it from C\u00e9cred for\u00a0$38.

Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD.

This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but\u00a0it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY.\u00a0I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but\u00a0it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me.

This purchase has been nothing short of a game changer. The fan's 360-degree rotatable design ensures that my four-year-old receives ample airflow, eliminating any discomfort from the heat. The speed regulation allows me to adjust the fan's intensity according to the day's temperature, and the ease of setup means it's perfectly tailored for any vehicle. No more sweaty backseat rides; my child can now enjoy a cool and comfortable journey, even on the hottest days.\" \u2014Ruth Get it from Amazon $28.99 (available in nine styles).\u00a0 Promising review: \"This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo\/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you, thank you, thank you!\" \u2014Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in women's sizes M\u2013XXL and in several color combos).\u00a0 Promising review: \"Super happy with this purchase! The price of 10 headbands is about the same as I have paid for one name-brand headband, so I was expecting sub-standard quality. But they are really great. I've worn them and washed them, and they are holding up well. They stay in place when I am working out hard or running. They are great at absorbing sweat, too.\u00a0They probably stay in place a little better than the\u00a0expensive\u00a0headbands I have. The colors\/designs are super nice, too.

I highly recommend this product!\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $12+\u00a0(available in two sizes).\u00a0 Psst \u2014 you can also get this in an \"extra strength\" version and a curly hair version!\u00a0 I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and\u00a0they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run. They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some \"yikes!\" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough.\u00a0 Promising review: \"These socks are designed perfectly for\u00a0running\u00a0socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you. The size is true to fit.\u00a0 I've purchased many packs of these and they are the best I've tried.\" \u2014SmokeyBear Get a pack of six from Amazon for $16.95+ (available in four color combos and sizes S\u2013L).

Promising review: \"I purchased this case in July for an upcoming canoe trip with a friend, and as luck would have it, we flipped our canoe. I just assumed my phone would be discovered a thousand years from now and placed in a museum as an ancient artifact. Fast forward to this week. I was contacted via FB by an Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office diver and guess what he found? Yup, my phone case with all of the contents intact and dry as a bone! He had to cut the case open, but there was not one single drop of water in it and he ended up purchasing a case for himself because he was just that impressed!\" \u2014Julie McDonald Here's what\u00a0BuzzFeeder Elizabeth Lilly\u00a0has to say about this case: \"With these,\u00a0I find that they're good for about a day due to condensation. So, for a trip I'll buy two to three.\u00a0I've used this case to take underwater pics, on boat rides, and have worn it with the lanyard jumping off a boat into water.

I stained a pair of beloved bright-blue bike shorts in my sleep and tried to get it out with soap and water, but the stain was still there when it came out of the wash.\u00a0I treated it with this, stuck it back in the wash, and BOOM, it's like it never happened\u00a0(I panicked before I could get a before and after, please forgive me, laundry gods). Promising review: \"I initially used this on the armpit sweat stains of my workout clothes. After a single wash, with two rinses as recommended, the stains were gone. I then used them on some dress shirts with hideous deodorant stains. GONE! The shirts are now in pristine condition and I don't have to throw them away. This product is amazing. I had used oxy clean previously, but it had the tendency to discolor my shirts. I've used this on red, blue, black, and orange shirts. No stains after washing and no bleeding or fading of color.\" \u2014Kimmy D Get it from Amazon for $12.99. Promising review: \"Expensive isn't always better. I tried this spray before spending the day outdoors in 90-degree heat at Disneyland, and the only place my makeup moved was on the tip of my nose because I have allergies and use a lot of Kleenex. But otherwise, it looked as fresh as it did when I put it on. I\u2019ve used Mac and\u00a0Urban\u00a0Decay\u00a0setting spray, and they never worked as well as this stuff. I am completely amazed.

ASK ME HOW OBSESSED WITH THESE SHORTS I AM, I DARE YOU!!!

On my first day of wearing them, I walked about 40 city blocks with no pain, blistering, or rubbing. Zilch!

I recently went on a weekend trip to Grand Cayman and decided to visit the Crystal Caves. I thought, \"Caves! They'll be nice and cool!\" Nope. I wore a gray T-shirt and looked like I'd swam wearing my clothes because it was so dang humid. But my feet were fine and cool thanks to these shoes.

Promising review: \"These work great. I live in Georgia and used it while mowing the grass in 95 degree heat and barely broke a sweat.

It's very high quality. Some reviews say it's no different than a wet towel. Not true. You can't get a towel to stay on your head, a towel doesn't breathe well and is too heavy when wet. Great product.\" \u2014Darrell Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in five colors). Promising review: \"Bought these on a whim to have for work to keep the\u00a0sweat\u00a0out of my eyes. Very cute, nice pops of color for my dark work outfits. But they work beautifully for moisture wicking so far. I've worked hard enough in the heat to where it looks like I have taken a shower and my shirt is soaked and I can wring the\u00a0sweat\u00a0from my ponytail. Gross, yes I know but that's my reality and my job demands it. But so far since I've been using these no\u00a0sweat\u00a0has burned my eyes and has keep my shirt much more dry than it has been, even my hair is less damp.

I'm pregnant and find it hard to relax and fall asleep now that I'm in my third trimester and these are great at night when I shower in the dark with just a nightlight. The scent is strong and will give a great waft every time it comes into contact with the hot water. I'm usually in the shower for about half an hour and I put this in the very back and it usually lasts throughout the entire time. If I put it near the front it dissolves in about 5\u20137 minutes and can be a little overpowering.

I\u2019ve been practicing lettering for awhile and have picked up a couple books here and there to practice with, but this book really took my hand lettering to the next level physically and with confidence. I also really appreciate that the author used good quality paper to practice on, as I\u2019ve used other books with poor quality paper that has ruined some of my pens.

Promising review: \"Thanks to this book, my self esteem has gotten a much needed boost as I proudly show off my finished masterpieces to anyone and everyone I think will give me a 'Wow!' in return. I can finish one in two or three sittings when I'm feeling sharp. It does say in the intro that my mind might start to meander along to other things while stickering but I will tell you that this is the ultimate mindfulness meditation time for me because if my mind starts to wander at all from repeating a24 or c12 whatever it is, I immediately forget what sticker I have on my finger. It is nice to think of nothing sometimes. The weight of the book alone makes you feel like it's something special. I like the perforations so I can tear out the sticker sheets to hold as I work on my masterpiece.

I got to try this and to say I'm obsessed does not express how passionately in love I am with this freakin' foundation. Holy cow, put me on a subscription. This stuff is literally flawless, gorgeous, *chef's kiss* on. It's also surprisingly suuuuper lightweight, like, to the point where I forget it's on. Normally when I'm wearing a full face of makeup, I can't WAIT to wash it off because I can feel it on my face but with this, I have to force myself to wash it off cuz it's so comfortable on. When they say \"can't feel coverage\" they meant that. Oh and btw, I could win the award for world's oiliest skin. I'm a greasy gworl. I haven't found a foundation that keeps me as matte as this does. Look, idk what Urban Decay is into but this potion is truly magic. I have to see how it does on hot summer days and at the pool but so far, it does everything it says it will. Doesn't transfer and blurs my skin beautifully.

First is meditation at least one to two times daily to quiet your mind. Another is an attitude of gratitude. Gratitude notes that our lives are a product of who we meet and experiences we have. The words 'thank you!' are like magic because they are heard less frequently. The style, substance, and structure of this journal is well thought out. It is compact and can easily be carried wherever you go. It is good quality material and construction so it will last a long time. It is a simple to use structure and guide.

Cuz these extensions are straight up wizardry. That's me above, I got to try these recently and I'm so in love. I've been wearing clip-ins for 10 years so I've tried 'em all. These reign supreme like Fiona Goode. My hair is like an inch longer than SHOULDER LENGTH and these invisible clip-ins blend so well with my hair even though they're 24\" long and my hair is like 12\" long. I used my Chi shampoo, conditioner, and serum, and flat ironed with my BaByliss Pro flat iron, and my curly hair got as bone straight as these silky extensions. I was a Bellami girly through and through until their seamless extensions literally started breaking at the weft after only having them a year. These are quality and the weft is so thin that it doesn't add any bulkiness to your hair. Def recommend trying these, currently obsessed. They look so natural and feel amazing in my hair.

After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2\u20133 minutes, I could see my white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin, however, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom and my scarring doesn\u2019t look as deep! The cleanser has a light clean scent. Not super strong! I am currently pairing this cleanser with the Anua heartleaf soothing toner to achieve glass skin. #glassskinera\" \u2014Myshel Cagle \"I can't live without this cleansing oil, it's magic in a bottle.

BuzzFeed Staff You only need a small dab for your hands, and don't worry, it's fragrance-free!\u00a0 Promising review: \"This stuff is incredible. I've been using it since I was a kid and it's just perfect. I get super dry hands, especially because where I live the winters can get down to -40 degrees F. This stuff is magic. I don't know how else to explain it. This is just the best and most moisturizing hand cream I've ever tried \u2014 and I've tried a lot! A little bit of this goes a LONG way, so don't worry that it's only two ounces.

I do follow up with a gentle cleanser to cleanse my skin once all my makeup is off. They're big and dry quickly so you can use the same towel a number of times before having to wash it or switch to another one.\" Promising review: \"These things are so soft! Great for taking off\u00a0makeup. I was using the Makeup Eraser\u00a0before, but these are 100 times better. You just wet them, wipe off your\u00a0makeup, rinse and hang out. I guess you could use a new one each day, but I they are very big so you can get a few days out of one.

I stumbled across this on TikTok. I had never heard of it before but decided to give it a try. I used it for the first time yesterday and I couldn't believe how amazing it made my hair feel and look. It's sooo soft, shiny, bouncy and nourished. My bleached rat's nest now looks and feels like hair again. I\u2019ve been really frustrated about my hair for years now because of all the damage. Now I can finally relax and enjoy my new hair.\" \u2014Eline \"Like many others, I tried this as a replacement for\u00a0Olaplex.

BearPaws are very well made \u2014 I bought a pair of slippers a while back and I'm still impressed with how beautifully made they are. Yet they're half the price of\u00a0Uggs. Don't get me wrong, I love my\u00a0Uggs, but wanted a less expensive, waterproof, warm boot to slog through Wisconsin winter snow\/slush and not worry about them getting messed up. These are perfect. They actually have better traction and arch support than\u00a0Uggs.

They were perfect for the festival I went to. I wanted shoes I didn\u2019t care that would get dirt and I didn\u2019t want to wear my Docs for that reason. Honestly I like these better than my Dr. Martens. I walked in these for three days straight, eight hours a day and they honestly didn\u2019t feel like normal boots they were pretty comfortable.

After you've given it a minute to dry, it lasts all day long and doesn't smudge or fade. It seriously gives the effect of false lashes, without the discomfort.\" Read her full Essence Lash Princess Mascara review for more!\u00a0 Emma says: \"Hello, that is my face above (I'm the blonde), because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time.\"\u00a0 Promising review: \"Saw this product on TikTok and thought it would be expensive looking at the results they got. I am beyond amazed with how my lashes look after about two coats. For around $5 you couldn\u2019t ask for a better mascara! I will be buying this same one when I run out. I was not expecting to like it as much as I do! No complaints.\" \u2014Kd Get it from Amazon for $4.74.

It works so great! A much more peaceful way to wake up for sure, if you\u2019re a heavy sleeper this may not work for you, but as someone who easily wakes up to light, it is great! Wayyyy cheaper than the Hatch one and does the exact same thing!\" \u2014Hannah Get it from Amazon for $32.88+\u00a0(available in three colors).\u00a0 After brushing and flossing, you paint your teeth with the pen (each pen contains about 20 uses), wait for 30 minutes, then rinse!\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"I have to say, I was skeptical about this product from all the\u00a0TikTok\u00a0hype about it but after trying it out, it really does work.\u00a0This was super easy, didn\u2019t hurt my teeth at all, and didn\u2019t taste much different than my regular toothpaste, since I got the mint-flavored one. I used it for a few weeks before my brother\u2019s wedding and it worked like a charm. I noticed visible results in only a couple of days and was able to keep using it until I reached my desired shade of white. 10\/10 would recommend for anyone with sensitive teeth and tastes!\" \u2014Victoria Bravo \"Saw this on BuzzFeed \u2014 they were right! It's easy to use and actually works. I was so surprised at how well this pen bleached out some coffee stains on my teeth after just one application. I've tried Crest\u00a0Whitestrips\u00a0and this is better because you can get in between the teeth.\" \u2014CS Get a two-pack from Amazon for $18.95+. Promising reviews: \"These joggers are as good as my Lululemon Align joggers and much much cheaper....can buy three of these for one LLL.\" \u2014Debra \"These are literally the best leggings\/joggers I have ever owned, and I plan to eventually buy every single color. I originally saw these on TikTok and heard they were like the Lululemon ones but cheaper. I've never owned Lululemon leggings, but if they feel anything like these, then I have clearly been missing out. These are soft and absolutely perfect. I love the pockets and jogger style and that they fit like leggings and can be worn to the gym or dressed up with a cute outfit. I need to buy every color of these before they're gone!\" \u2014Courtney\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $28.99+ (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL and 22 colors).\u00a0 Note that this doesn't heat the milk up, though, the way the Nespresso frother does.

It\u2019s so much fun to use and you make your at home drinks feel so much more special. It\u2019s easy to use and froths pretty quickly if you\u2019re on the fence I\u2019d say what are you waiting for buy it already!\" \u2014Denise \"I have tried the Illy machine with steam frother, the Nespresso\u00a0Aeroccino and this one.

The best caff\u00e8 macchiato, macchiatone, cappuccino etc.\" \u2014andrea c Get it from Amazon for $16.79+\u00a0(available in 37 styles). Promising review: \"We received this 100-piece set three weeks ago and my 3.5 year old son has been playing with it daily. Compared to the Magna-Tiles, the Picasso Tiles are very slightly heavier and the magnets are stronger too. Manga-Tiles seem to be more durable as each tile is secured with metal rivets whereas the PicassoTiles are secured with glue. However, I haven\u2019t had any issue with the tiles cracking or breaking apart when my son builds them into tall towers, especially considering how many times they\u2019ve crashed to our wood floor.\" \u2014LG Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$39.99.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Le Creuset? Don't know her. I have always wanted one of these enamel covered cast iron beauties, but even from the outlet stores they were expensive. I saw this guy after finding a stew recipe that went from stove to oven, and I got it. I am DELIGHTED with this purchase! I've cooked in it several times, including a chili recipe tonight that had to reduce by half. It left a ridiculous ring on the inside, and that sucker wiped right out. I haven't burned or scorched any of my foods and it's pretty, too!\" \u2014HerRoyalHighness Get a 6-quart Dutch oven from Amazon for $56.13+ (available in two other sizes and 10 total colors).\u00a0 Watch a TikToker compare these to the Abercrombie faux leather pants\u00a0here.\u00a0 Promising reviews:\u00a0\"Perfect pants for the winter and cold weather. The cold breeze is always blocked! I love these and they fit so well!\" \u2014Olivia Alvarez \"Love them! They are lightweight and breathable with moderate\u00a0stretch. Unless looking close you can't tell its not leather. And obviously doesn't feel like leather but who cares. For the price these pants are fantastic. I'd definitely recommend.\" \u2014Mimi Get them from Amazon for $52.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS-XL and up to 18 colors).\u00a0 Like I said, I own these and love 'em!

I use it like a serum and put a few drops on my face and d\u00e9collet\u00e9 before I apply moisturizer in the morning or night cream.

Can even reuse if I wanted.\" \u2014miguel mendez \"I own a cleaning business and have spent a small fortune on the name brand. I clean everything from condo rentals to long-term lease\/residential rentals and I have had to clean unimaginable NASTY, I mean 'pics or it didn't happen' kind of nasty, and these cut right through it. These work just as well as the name brand, if not better, and they seem to last a little longer!\" \u2014Keisha Marie Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $14.95. The earbuds can play four-plus hours with a charge, and the wireless charging case can provide up to 14 hours of charge. Promising review: \"Best decision! These are the greatest headphones ever! I saw them on\u00a0TikTok months ago and added them to my wishlist. I got a new phone that doesn't have the headphone port so I decided it was time to finally buy them.

I love Laniege\u2019s lip sleeping mask but, it gets pricy when used daily. This product is the most amazing alternative for it at a FRACTION of the price! Laniege is $24 for just one and this is less than $10 for three?! THREE? Omg take my money. Highly recommend! \u2014Nikz Get a set of three from Amazon for\u00a0$9.90\u00a0(available in six scent combinations). Several reviewers mentioned they drink more water with it because of the straw, and they're not mad about how adorable it is, either! Promising review: \"Please do not run out to Targ\u00e9 and waste your money on a Stanley IF you\u2019re only using a cup for ice\/cold drinks. This cup is just as good and far more affordable. I put ice in my cup over 24 hours ago during my shift at the hospital, and there is still ice in the cup! This product is BEYOND worth it at this price point. You won\u2019t be disappointed.

Check it out on TikTok! Promising review: \"No joke, these are pretty much exactly the same as my Skims lounge set for half the price. The pants graze the tops of my feet even when I wear them high-waisted at my belly button, so I think they\u2019re plenty long. The robe is like wearing a blanket, but still looks put together. Anyway, I\u2019m back here to buy a second color because I loved them so much!\" \u2014Jenna Get the three-piece set from Amazon for $54.99\u00a0(available in women's sizes S\u2013XL and in 24 colors).

I usually spend anywhere from $25\u2013$30 on one tube of concealer and still feel unsatisfied with the coverage. Or it looks too heavy and thick by the time i set with a damp makeup sponge and powder (accentuating my under eye fine lines). This little gem is great. I use this concealer every day instead of all my high-end brand concealers. It's full coverage, buildable, lasts all day, not drying and not too liquidy. I'm so happy I gave this a try, will definitely be keeping this baby in my every day makeup bag.\" \u2014Brittney \"My favorite!\u00a0I heard a lot about this product on TikTok.

I love how these have the little cuts in the front. Super great spinoff of the\u00a0Aerie\u00a0Crossover. They fit shorter but honestly, they still look so cute. I kinda wish I would have sized up.

With this one, I can confirm that it fit around my waist comfortably without outerwear, across my chest without outerwear, *and* over a thick coat and several layers. The pockets inside are so handy and I even had room to spare throughout my Iceland trip. Just make sure that you zip the zipper ALL the way because the zipper goes down pretty far on the sides for easier access to contents.\" Promising review:\"I\u2019m SOO impressed with the quality of this bag! I\u2019ve worn the Lululemon belt bag and I gotta say, this is pretty similar.\u00a0Almost identical, except the Lululemon is a tiny bit smaller size. The Lululemon one also has a plastic zipper but this Amazon one is metal. I prefer the plastic but this one is OK. It might be better than Lululemon JUST for the fact that they have so many color options!\" \u2014Em Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$13.98\u00a0(available in 43 styles).\u00a0 More bells and whistles: they come with an optional timer that'll turn them on at the same time every day, and you can adjust their brightness level and choose between flickering or just a steady \"on\".\u00a0 They need three AAA batteries per candle, but that will last you about 150 hours \u2014 over six days if you left them on constantly.\u00a0 Promising review: \"With the price of batteries, these beautiful candles are a must. I've always used\u00a0Luminara, which, unfortunately, devour batteries and die after several years. These candles also have a more soothing, ambient affect.

I discovered this brand from my coworker who was wearing this bodysuit in a different color and it looked so good on her I knew I had to give them a try. Finding items that fit my body nicely is next to impossible; but THIS?! It was literally perfect and full coverage + support and not sheer at all! I\u2019m buying this in so many colors and the quality is SO good. I love this more than my\u00a0Skims!\" \u2014Zoe T Get it from Amazon for $29.99\u00a0(available in women's sizes S\u2013XXL and five colors). BuzzFeed Shopping writer\u00a0Emma Lord\u00a0says, \"I'm a Glossier Cloud Paint stan so I'll continue to buy it, but I love this affordable alternative, too! It spreads on super easily and can either go on sheer or build for a bolder effect. I got the Rose Flush\u00a0shade and enjoy it for ~everyday wear~ since it's so easy to squirt a bit on my fingers, swirl it into my cheeks, and be on my merry way. It lasts all day and looks super natural to boot!\"\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"This is a great, cheap alternative to\u00a0Glossier\u00a0Cloud Paint. It\u2019s less pigmented and blends more easily, so it looks very natural.\" \u2014Amazon Customer \"Such a pretty color! Heard about this on TikTok. Sheer and the color is sweet. And the price can't be beat.\" \u2014Kaye Ralene White-Hancock Get it from Amazon for $5.98+\u00a0(available in six shades).\u00a0 It's sold out frequently thanks to TikTok, so if you want this, it's probably best to grab it while it's in stock!\u00a0 Promising reviews:\u00a0\"I was super impressed with this primer after have tried Tatcha Silk Canvas. The textures in my opinion were nearly identical! It was easy to spread, it felt like silk but not like super silicone or anything like that, very velvet like. No scent, my makeup didn\u2019t separate nor crease, key is a little goes a very long way. For $8 you can\u2019t beat it!\" \u2014Brandy Dail \"Highly recommend. Learned about it as several influencers used it on\u00a0TikTok. Tried it and it\u2019s my favorite. Better than all the expensive brands I had tried before. Smooth application and does an excellent job! Excellent.\" \u2014Binnyx1 Get it from Amazon for $10.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Comparable to Lululemon. I love my\u00a0Lulus\u00a0but wanted something more affordable and this hit the mark! I\u2019m typically a size medium, and the medium fits great! I bought two, the fuchsia and white \u2014 I love both colors and the material is very soft.\" \u2014Alyssa Lynch Get it from Amazon for $22.99+\u00a0(available in women's sizes XS\u20133XL and 29 colors).\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"I wore these to the gym one day and my Lululemons the next. I preferred these. They stay on better, are a little bit thicker, and feel softer. Granted my expensive\u00a0Lulus are two years old, but well taken care of. These are cheaper and better quality. Side by side it is hard to even tell the difference, other than the logo on the back; and the stitching on the inner leg is different on these than the Lululemon.\" \u2014Alaina \"Currently 20 weeks pregnant and these are all I wear, I basically live in these leggings. They\u2019re so stretchy and comfy, definitely recommend for pregnancy!\" \u2014Alba siviero Get them from Amazon for $19.99+\u00a0(available in women's sizes XS\u2013XL, with 25\" or 28\" inseam, and in 22 colors\/patterns). Prime members:\u00a0You can\u00a0try before you buy! Yes it's cold out right now, but I always wear my Birks around the house just bc they're that comfy! And if you're lucky enough to get to snowbird somewhere warm, these could be very nice to have.\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"I bought these sandals before a three-week trip in Europe; I didn't want to pay for Birks but did want something in similar style with good arch support. I was a little skeptical about the low price, but gave them a shot...and they were the MOST comfortable sandals I've ever owned. I walked over 120\u00a0miles\u00a0in them in three weeks on our trip and never once had foot pain. They broke in so quickly and were very supportive from the get-go \u2014 and still are! Highly recommend.\" \u2014Han Lin \"I saw these sandals on TikTok so, I decided to try them. They are SO COMFY. You can\u2019t beat the price either. They\u2019re extremely soft and the strap across the top of the foot closest to the ankle offers good support so, you\u2019re safe if you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of walking. I highly recommend these sandals.\" \u2014PlantLady Get them from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in\u00a0women's sizes 6\u201312, including wide sizes, and 11 styles). Promising review: \"Don't hesitate, just buy these. I was using the Real Technique sponges for years and\u00a0bought these on a whim after seeing several TikToks praising these. I love these sponges and the price. I apply liquid foundation with a damp sponge and these work better than Real Techniques. They are dense but soft and 'bouncy.' I wash mine between each use and these hold up very well and much better than the RT. Very happy with my purchase and the price. Will definitely continue to buy.\" \u2014chris Get a set of five from Amazon for $6.99+\u00a0(available in seven sets of colors). Keep up with luxe beauty releases? Yep, it's very similar to the $40\u00a0James Charles x Morphe palette... Promising reviews: \"Clearly time I got a new eyeshadow palette. Sargent Freddie Mercury (my not even 4-pound bunny) made it his mission to destroy my James\u00a0Charles\u00a0overpriced palette.\u00a0This palette is the same quality, maybe even nicer.\u00a0This eyeshadow was put on at around 3 p.m. and it's almost 1 a.m., the 'highlight' stayed on my nose even with my mask on through a whole day of work. That blew my mind.\" \u2014Daniel T Adams \"The colors are very pigmented! All I have to say is RUN and get this product!!!! I looked up reviews on TikTok for affordable but pigmented palettes and I kept seeing this one. Safe to say I was NOT disappointed.\" \u2014Courtney Melvin Get it from Amazon for $8.99. Promising reviews: \"What can I say, I saw a TikTok about this lipstick and for $10 had to try it! The reviews are right, for some reason this lipstick is better than even $20 name-brand ones bought from Ulta. Not only does it smell great, but dries in under a minute and survived eating a cupcake, a Starbucks drink, and an entire evening out, no smudging and had to be removed with a makeup wipe. Fantastic product!!\" \u2014Claire \"Beautiful and soooo worth the money! Usually I always purchase either Stila Cosmetics or Kylie Jenner but both of those are very pricey and expensive, so I looked up matte lip glosses on Amazon and saw this and thought I would give it a try. I absolutely love it. Very easy to put on does not smudge, beautiful colors, very very happy about the size of it! I went and purchased set B now because I love this product!\" \u2014Vickyy Get a six-piece set from Amazon for $9.88\u00a0(available in three shade sets).\u00a0 Multiple reviewers like it for sensitive skin, acne-prone skin, and oily or combo skin times (reviewers with dry skin like it, too). Several people say it's similar to the $182 (I knowwww!!)\u00a0SkinCeuticals vitamin C serum.\u00a0 Promising reviews:\u00a0\"I actually heard of this product on TikTok. It\u2019s a nice lightweight formula. Makes your skin so smooth and I\u2019ve noticed a more even looking skin tone.\" \u2014Katelyn Hoffa \"I absolutely LOVE this serum. I was spending an absurd amount of money on\u00a0SkinCeuticals\u00a0products. This serum is way better. My skin is clearer and more bright. The only negative about this serum is the smell. It's awful! I will tolerate it and continue to use it because of its effectiveness and price!\" \u2014Tish \"I am a licensed esthetician who deals with hormonal cystic acne that leaves scarring on my sensitive skin. My skin has improved so much since I started this!!! First, my skin purged out underlying blemishes but after was clearer + smoother than I\u2019ve seen it in YEARS! I love that it not only targets my acne scarring with the vitamin C but also soothes the redness with the niacinimide, has retinol, AND helps minimize my blackheads and pore size with the salicylic acid. \ud83d\ude2d It is the perfect product for my sensitive oily acne prone skin!\"\u00a0\u2014Jackie Get it from Amazon for $13.49. Promising reviews: \"I have the kind of eyebrows that look very full with brushing, but can quickly look like one has 'collapsed' once my hair or something else touches it. I\u2019ve used nearly every product from Anastasia Beverly Hills, but never had luck keeping my brows in place. Well, let me tell you, this stuff is no joke. I had to scrub my eyebrows clean tonight to get them to move. If you need some help holding your fluff, this will be your new favorite product. Also, I was able to ditch the eyebrow pencil since this this stuff holds every hair in the place you brush it.\" \u2014Bailey M, Deacon \"Saw this on TikTok and after looking around where I live for some clear soap and coming up short I decided to try these out. They are a great value for the price. Super easy to use and give a great effect on the brows.\" \u2014Linds Get it from Amazon for $7.99+\u00a0(available in a one- or two-piece set, and with a brow gel). Some reviewers said that they were able to skip wearing a bra with it! Promising reviews: \"Okay this is so good. I had the\u00a0Zara\u00a0bodysuit identical to this but it quickly got stretched out so I tried this one out. It is 10 times better than that one. The fit is perfect, it hugs you just right and is supportive enough that I won\u2019t wear a bra. Also, not see through at all! Amazing. Need in all the colors.\" \u2014Dawn E. \"Saw these on a TikTok video and I took a chance. The sherbet orange one looks just like the picture and it\u2019s double layered material so it\u2019s not see through. It\u2019s smooth material and lays flat. Will def buy more.\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL and 29 colors).\u00a0 Prime members: You can\u00a0try before you buy!

I\u2019m a 5.5 in heels so I got the 5 and they fit perfectly. They are pretty comfy too, which is nice. I\u2019m thinking about getting them in different colors now.\" \u2014Courtney Van Court \"Baby goooorl... March yourself into the checkout browser because these are so so so good!! They're really\u00a0comfortable, which I wasn't expecting all except for the ankle strap, but I think that's because I'm sensitive??? The height was something I was a little scared of, but they're so easy to walk in, I suppose the platform cancels out a portion of the heel. Obviously they're not perfect, but if you want that, you should probably go talk Versace with $1,800 in your pocket.\" \u2014Anika Get them from Amazon for $39.99+\u00a0(available in women's sizes 4\u201310.5 and seven colors). Check out a TikTok of the SoCozy Curl Spray\u00a0on one kiddo's gorgeous hair. Reviewers with curls all the way from 2a\u20134c love it! Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by this. I didn\u2019t think it would work as well as it does. My little one has curly hair and it\u2019s not very long. (She\u2019s 2.5-years-old.) I was using a misting spray that I didn\u2019t love the smell of and it was kind of on the\u00a0expensive side. So I gave this a try to see if it could replace that one. And it ABSOLUTELY DOES!\u00a0This redefines my daughters almost coil curls, moisture is great for her frizzy curls and I thought maybe this would be too heavy for\u00a0more\u00a0than after shower wet hair but it\u2019s great on dry hair!\" \u2014Sarah Get it from Amazon for $7.59. Promising reviews:\u00a0\"This is velvet, full coverage without feeling like glue on your lips. It does transfer. The color is very pigmented so what you see is what you get.

I usually go for lip stains because I love bold lip colors but hate it when they smear. I saw a TikTok where a woman was raving about these velvet lip stains so had to give it a go! It isn\u2019t a stain at all but it is a super nice, velvety long wearing lipstick that is HIGHLY pigmented for an affordable price point.\" \u2014OCDesthetician Get it from Amazon for $9.90\u00a0(available in 23 shades).\u00a0 As one reviewer mentions, pick up some\u00a0reusable pads\u00a0and you'll never have to buy makeup wipes again!\u00a0 Promising reviews: \"I was skeptical about this product at first but I am so glad I decided to buy it. It really removes my makeup, even waterproof mascara with ease. It has no smell and doesn't leave my face oily. It reminds me of my Bioderma that I got in the UK. And for this price, amazing!\" \u2014Kat \"Miracle worker. Minimal smell, feels nice, helped a lot when taking off make-up. Really good. Came unopened and brand new. Bought it because of TikTok haha.\" \u2014Tracey Get it from Amazon for $8.97+\u00a0(available in three sizes and in packs).\u00a0 BTW, this is our budget pick for the\u00a0best makeup remover!

Promising reviews: \"This is my new favorite peel product! In 10 minutes, my skin looked glowy and smooth, and felt soft and even. There was zero irritation, just healthy, happy skin. Babyfacial works, but always left my skin red, extra oily, and hot to the touch. Not this product though! Not to mention it literally costs less than 10% of what Babyfacial costs.\" \u2014ClaireEB \"TikTok was right. I love this! I have been using it for 4 weeks, once a week and have noticed a difference in my skin. It has helped clear up my acne as well as even my texture.

Promising review: \"I had a work trip in New Orleans and was looking for something cute, business casual, and cool enough to survive pregnancy while traversing through the swamp. I was slightly concerned about quality, but for the price, I was fine with risking it. YALL. It is sooo much better than I could\u2019ve even imagined. It\u2019s precious. The white is a little sheer but not so bad that you need an undershirt. I did wear nude shapewear, but I always do. Super light fabric, plenty of stretch, and super\u00a0flowy. I sized up to accommodate my 23-week baby belly, and it was perfect. I got more compliments on this outfit than I\u2019ve gotten on any in the past few years. If you're nervous about it, just get it.

BuzzFeed Staff Promising reviews:\u00a0\"I always see people using this on\u00a0TikTok, but the videos don\u2019t even do it justice. The Pink Stuff made everything spotless. Counters, stoves, sinks, literally everything. Best cleaning product in the world and I will literally never use any other brand again.\" \u2014Hailey Peters \"This stuff is some magic sorcery.\u00a0I\u2019m not usually a fan of traditional cleaning products and tend to opt for natural based cleaners. However, I had some soot over the fire place nothing would take off. Not only did it do a pretty dang good job on that\u2026everything I\u2019ve tried it on has gotten that item super clean with minimal scrubbing effort.\u00a0Will always have on hand now.\u00a0Got hard water stains off when\u00a0CLR\u00a0wouldn\u2019t even get it clean and made the faucet look brand new\" \u2014Kim Montero Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$5.29. Promising review: \"We cannot BEGIN to tell you what a lifesaver this is! We have two old fiberglass tubs with vinyl shower enclosures that no matter what amount of scrubbing we have done with everything from bleach to cleanser to vinegar and baking soda would NOT come clean. After I took my shower last night, I sprayed down the tub and walls. Within minutes, all the built-up water deposits and dirt and grime began to melt away in front of my eyes. I left it on overnight, and when I got up this morning, it did not look like the same tub and shower. This product is a godsend, especially for old folks like us who have difficulty getting down on our hands and knees and scrubbing anything. More importantly, it performs as advertised. We plan on using it as part of our weekly cleanup routine. This is truly an overnight sensation!\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.60+\u00a0(available in two scents).\u00a0 Promising review: \"This stuff is amazing. I live in an older apartment complex and even though I scrub and clean my bathtub every week, the caulk around the edge still managed to grow mold and turn brown\/black. I scrubbed with many different products and it didn't seem to make a difference. I found this product and the transformation is huge. First, it's easy to apply because of the squeeze top. I was able to just really focus on the caulk. Then, because it's a gel, it stayed put and didn't ooze everywhere. It really surprised me on those vertical sides. In the first picture, I already scrubbed my tub and even used some sturdy brushes attached to my power drill. The second half of the picture is after five hours of letting this mold remover soak and just wiping it off.\" \u2014Rochelle Get it from Amazon for $14.99.

Our water is so full of iron, you can\u2019t even drink it, so it stains everything it touches.

I was pleasantly surprised. The toilet tank is from the 1960s and I doubt it's been cleaned within the last few decades. In the 'after' photo [above] you can see that there is still some rust left over but large chunks fell off the sides and can be seen on the bottom of the tank.\" \u2014Nicole Get it from Amazon for $7.27\u00a0(also available in a multipack). Promising review: \"This stuff is absolutely AMAZING. My wife and I were getting tired of looking at our worn-out cabinets and wood paneling and were very close to paying a professional thousands of dollars to refinish it all, but then we came across this product. Our paneling and cabinets were looking rough. We have two dogs who jumped up and scratched places. We also had an area that was damaged by water spots where our dog bowls were. Several other areas were just worn from heavy traffic. This stuff was like a magical eraser for water spots, scratches, scuffs, and any other blemish. We simply wiped the product on with a paper towel and let it sit for 20 minutes before wiping it off with a clean towel. Everything looks brand-new. I'm buying a couple more so we can finish our cabinets and wood paneling. We're so glad we found this product.\" \u2014Kris Get it from Amazon for $9.98. Promising review: \"I don't often write a review of a product. But this was so impressive, I thought I should let others know. We have a set of vinyl outdoor chairs that were constantly covered with mildew. When we were feeling ambitious, we'd take the time to power wash the chairs, which worked pretty well but was a lot of work. The problem was that a couple of days later, the mildew was back almost as bad a before. With this mildew stain remover, we sprayed the chairs, let them sit a few minutes, and hosed off with a regular garden hose. Easy. And they were cleaner than they ever got using the power washer. When we put the chairs away two months later, they were still clean.\" \u2014Christine A. Simonson Get it from Amazon for $10.48+\u00a0(available in three sizes).

I was skeptical when I first sprayed it onto my fridge because it took a second for the streaks to start fading, but lo and behold, there was *zero* residue left behind after a super brief wipe sesh. Once I saw how downright dazzling my fridge looked, I decided to put it to the ~real~ test \u2014 my filthy dishwasher. Again, a minute of buffing with a microfiber towel was enough to make it look like a brand new appliance, and it worked wonders on the greasy stainless steel edges of my oven, too.\" Promising review:\u00a0\"I live in an apartment.\u00a0The sink is about 35 years old and has become badly stained and scratched from neglect and indifferent care.\u00a0This has made a noticeable difference. This sink will never look brand new again, but your product removed, I would say, about 80% of the stains, without any extraordinary effort, and put a really polished look on the sink.\u00a0It is gleaming and actually looks very clean for the first time since I have lived here.\u00a0\u2014David Brennan Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$19.95+\u00a0(available in two sizes). Promising review: \"I thought the world had ended!! RED WINE SPILLED ON AN ORIENTAL CARPET!!! The cream fringe took the brunt of the spill. The first thing I did was put white wine on it\u2026after all, isn\u2019t that what you have heard and read? That white wine will remove red wine from whatever. Didn\u2019t work for me. Rush to Amazon\u2026what to do\u2026.what to do? I found several products that sounded promising. I read the reviews. So glad that this is what I chose! Worked like a dream. When it arrived the stain had been set for four days, and following the directions on the bottle, the stain instantly started to disappear. My cream-colored fringe was back. Amazing!!! My carpet is back to its beautiful self. Am I happy? So happy words can\u2019t convey.\" \u2014Pat Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available as a wipe or spray as well as in multipacks). Promising review: \"I love you, little electric pressure washer! Oh let me count the ways...I honestly can't say enough good things about this little guy. Our deck was in serious need of a wash. I really liked the idea of a small electric pressure washer mainly for the ease of maneuverability but was unsure if it really had the power to get the job done. Oh man, let me tell you this thing is fantastic! Once I got started I couldn't stop. I was washing everything in sight. Deck, fire pit, stepping stones, planters, outside rug...I was unstoppable! I was a filthy mess from the thighs down because of all the muck flying everywhere but I didn't care, I was happy.\" \u2014Larry Crouch Get it from Amazon for $169.99. Promising review: \"If I could give this product 6 stars, I would. My husband and I use it almost every day. We have three furry dogs and six fluffy cats, which makes for A LOT of hair. We were using a lint roller before we bought our ChomChom Roller. The lint roller didn't work very well and had to be replaced. We have had our ChomChom Roller for months and it still works just as well as it did when we first got it. We can actually invite our friends over now without worrying about all the pet hair.\" \u2014Morgan Willis Get it from Amazon for $21.99+\u00a0(available in three colors).\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"I rarely post reviews, but this stuff has completely changed our lives. Our dishwasher, utensils, plates, and glasses were covered with dry scale and\u00a0nothing\u00a0we tried came close to helping. After using the tablets three times our dishwasher looks like new; our glasses are sparkling like fine china and everything\u00a0else\u00a0looks fabulous. Highly recommend, worth every penny, best product BY FAR!!! One great advantage is you can use it with your dishes. Some other products are used to clean the dishwasher but not to clean dishes and glasses. Buy this, you will be blown away!!! It is astounding!\" \u2014Jenny Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $8.99\u00a0(also available in a 12-pack). This oven scrub is made out of 100% plant- and mineral-derived ingredients.

Well worth any wait.\" \u2014Diane Coury Get it from Everneat on Etsy or Amazon for $19.99 (available in three scents). Promising review: \"I had never even thought of descaling my 2-year-old Keurig before Amazon suggested it, but this stuff was cheap, I knew I was supposed to descale regularly, and I knew this kind of descaler wouldn't be as hard to rinse out as the smell of vinegar.\u00a0I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the next morning it took much less time for the water to heat up and my coffee tasted twice as strong and rich as it did before descaling, which means the brewing temperature is higher now that the heating element isn't caked with mineral deposits. Now I feel a little silly for drinking mediocre coffee for so long.\" \u2014Lenore Get it from Amazon for $9.99+\u00a0(available in two sizes). Promising review: \"I had no idea that cleaning a Keurig was a thing. I bought these because I saw them on\u00a0TikTok\u00a0believe it or not. I wanted to give it a go because my Keurig isn\u2019t that old and I didn\u2019t think it would do anything. IT WORKS SO WELL! My Keurig wasn\u2019t as nasty as some I\u2019ve seen, luckily.

Promising review: \"Two months ago we got an 6-month-old puppy who has needed some time to get adjusted. That included more than a few accidents in our living room and on his bed. This machine has made clean up of everything so much simpler and I love that it's deep cleaning and has a nontoxic pet cleaner so that our not-so-little puppy can isn't harmed through exposure or smells. Also helpful since my teenage sons like to camp out on the couch with their friends on long weekends and our couch gets that fresh clean smell in an hour.\" \u2014Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for $123.59. Promising review: \"My daughter and I live in a carpeted studio apartment. We both have long thick hair. We also have two cats: one with short hair and one with long fine hair. This sweeper is amazing. I had a vacuum cleaner that was new and so awful that it would burn out before I could vacuum half the studio. It was also impractical for our tiny space. This sweeper is a godsend. It picks up ALL of the hair, human, cat, even the fine, thin, soft long cat hair. It's also great at picking up the cat litter. I don't know what type of carpet ours is, but it's definitely not low pile. The only thing it does not pick up are the torn out pieces of carpet from the cat tree on the floor, but that's OK. This has been so much easier than the other vacuum cleaner we had.\" \u2014J. S. Get it from Amazon for $30.89.

Went on easily and cleaned the floors easily! I always hated the one-time use pads and never felt like they got my floor clean.

They're safe to use with pretty much any type of washer: HE or regular, top-loading and front-loading.  Promising review:\u00a0\"I've been using this product for several years now. I have two teens and a husband who's an auto technician. Boy do they get filthy! After time this grime buildup will make your washer stink bad. I don't do it every month as they say to as I don't have that type of money but when it stinks, this product is the bomb! Makes your washer smell really fresh, like brand new. If it still stinks after one tablet, pop another one in and no more stink!! Yay! I would give this 20 stars if I could. Really love this product so much so that I bought the ones for my dishwasher too!! (they work great too!)\" \u2014berja Get a pack of six from Amazon for $11.95. Check out why this TikToker loves this stuff here. Promising review: \"Initially, I bought this because I\u2019m potty training a puppy and it\u2019s not going great. This product really worked well on my carpets for the dog messes! However, I\u2019m writing this review because my jerk cat decided one evening that my new comforter was a great potty spot. Thankfully I noticed the mess immediately so I was able to get this product on it immediately as well. I did let it sit overnight to really penetrate the stuffing even tho that isn't in the directions. I was certain the comforter was a goner. I tossed it in the wash the next morning and I am BLOWN AWAY by the lack of smell or stain. Cat urine is so stubborn and it can easily feel overwhelming when trying to eliminate the smell but this product 100% has my support. I\u2019m buying more the second I\u2019m done with this review.

I have a 24-year-old home that has not been remodeled yet. The master bath shower tile and fiberglass shower pan were in pretty bad shape. We tried many types of cleaners to remove residual soap and hard water stains with little success. As a last-ditch effort, I purchased these brushes. They worked amazingly well. Using Krud Kutter and these brushes removed every bit of the dirt and polished those tiles so that they shine brilliantly like they did when they were new. I am completely satisfied with my purchase of these brushes. They are well made and held up beautifully to the forces I applied while using them.\" \u2014Tom S4TX Get the set of three from Amazon for $18.95 (available in six different brush stiffnesses).

My German shepherd mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping \u2014 this cleaner lifted the stain and now it\u2019s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on Amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissell carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power.

Promising review: \"Last night I was reborn. What is the cause of this renewed zest for life, you might ask? It was the use of the Rubbermaid Reveal Power Scrubber on my shower grout. It elevated a simple baking soda-and-water solution to alchemical proportions. My pink-tiled shower, the one that came with my scummy apartment, the one that never looks clean no matter how many hours of backbreaking labor I put in, now looks bright, clean, and full of promise. An otherwise disgusting and dated purely utilitarian part of my home is now art. TL;DR: This is absolutely incredible.\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99.

This shampoo is hypoallergenic, cruelty-free, and paraben-free. Promising review: \"I absolutely LOVE this brush shampoo! I was a little skeptical of how well it would clean my brushes since I'd never tried it before, but after using this I am very pleased with the outcome. It has a faint shampoo scent but nothing too overpowering, and suds like you wouldn't believe. It got all the way down to the base of the brush and gave it a really good cleaning. One of my brushes is made from boar hair (Est\u00e9e Lauder powder brush) and I was worried it was going to frizz it out and ruin the shape, but it actually improved it after I had previously used baby shampoo. It's very soft and not at all coarse feeling. I also used this shampoo on my Beauty Blender, and it did a great job getting all the foundation out. All in all, I'd rate this product a 10\/10!\" \u2014Ryan Brooks Get it from Amazon for $6.79.

Promising review: \"As soon as I used this stuff, I couldn't believe it! We had a new stove that I didn't clean for months and assumed the burnt pea juice (my enemy) would just be a new stain forever. However, after one application, it was basically gone. I used the scraper that came with it and did one more small application on just that spot, and it was gone! Every time I use this it looks like my stove could be brand-new.\" \u2014Christi Get it from Amazon for $12.48. Promising review: \"This stuff really works on grease! I was skeptical about purchasing this product because nothing seemed to clean my greasy stovetop.

Footbed is more padded than the designer version. Leather is soft and comfortable on the foot. Sole is not slippery.\" \u2014Emily Wilson Get it from Amazon for $49.89+ (available in sizes 5\u201312 and in 10 colors). Promising review: \"I love this! Good quality, and the pattern is beautiful. It came in a cute envelope. This scarf fits well as a top, it is silky, so it slides a little if you don\u2019t tie it right. I also use it as a headband in different ways.\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.99\u00a0(available in 33 colors and patterns and various two-packs).

This is a well-made, sturdy, rattan woven bag. I especially like the secure top snap. Also, the strap isn't too long (usually a problem) if you're petite. It has a pretty floral liner, which makes it different. It fits my smartphone, card wallet, and small makeup bag. This is my go-to spring bag. Loving it!\" \u2014DJ Get it from Amazon for $21.99+\u00a0(available in two colors). Promising review: \"I have trouble with rain boots because I have wide feet and they usually crowd my toes but these are perfect! Super comfortable and didn\u2019t need to break them in whatsoever. Sprayed the hose on them to make sure they\u2019re waterproof and they are! But some water will come in on the sides where there is fabric but that\u2019s pretty standard with any boot like this. Just amazed at the quality and comfort for the price.\" \u2014J. Enyeart Get them from Amazon for $27.98+\u00a0(available in sizes 5\u201312 and 15 colors). Promising review: \"I love this jumper. Super comfy, a perfect fit. The waist is a string tie (not elastic!), which I really like... The ankles and wrists are stretchy with the perfect amount of 'give' so I can get my feet and hands in and out easily. The fabric is lightweight and easy to move, dance, and do yoga in. Of course, it's a V-neck, so I wear a cami, sports top, or halter underneath.

If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sport coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. I've had it for three weeks, and it is life-changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore. I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat...I was sweating through my shirt on my back...BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS.

I came across a\u00a0TikTok\u00a0promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable.

It never\u00a0worked\u00a0\u2019til I bought this one. Let me tell you, it only took just under a week to see GREAT results. It\u2019s pretty much gone and it\u2019s been less than two months.

These cold sores were probably the worst I've had and wouldn't clear up or stop itching\/hurting. I googled cold sore remedies, and these happened to pop up. After reading the reviews, I immediately ordered them. They came right on time, and I put them on before bed last night.\u00a0It's been less than 36 hours, and these cold sores are already healing beautifully. I plan to order another pack or three, so I can keep one at home, one in my purse, and one in my locker at work so if I ever feel the warning tingle\/itching of a new breakout, I can slap one of these bad boys on and get rid of it quickly! Highly recommend for my fellow cold sore sufferers.\" \u2014Jessica Hill Get a pack of 30 from Amazon for $27.32\u00a0(also available as a pack of 15).

Truly a\u00a0miracle\u00a0product. I had an AWFUL keloid bump forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was just getting bigger and more irritated by the day, nothing was helping. I bought this stuff and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone!\u00a0I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn\u2019t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick! Also smells pretty good, definitely no bothersome or overwhelming scent which is appreciated in a product that I\u2019m applying on the nose area.\" \u2014Jordan Caprigno Get it from Amazon for $12.85\u00a0(also available in multipacks).

I stick it on and honestly forget that it's even there.\u00a0The adhesive is strong, so it stays on during my tossing and turning at night, but I often wear it during the day, too! I work from home, and it's not noticeable during my video calls which I truly, truly appreciate.\u00a0I begin seeing the gunk from my zits after 2\u20133 hours of having it covered, but I leave it on for at least the full six. When it's removed, it's like the healing time was sped up and what would've taken a couple of days took just HOURS.\" Be sure to read the full\u00a0Mighty Pimple Patch review\u00a0for more deets! Promising review:\u00a0\"These little patches are a miracle worker. When I feel a pimple coming on, I slap one of these on and leave it on overnight and the next day it's gone before it's even started. Also\u00a0have\u00a0used them on full-blown breakouts and it shortens the healing time. A\u00a0must-have.\"\u00a0\u2014Chris C. Get a 36-pack from Amazon for $10.77. Check it out in action on TikTok!

I was initially skeptical of trying anything on my feet.. and let\u2019s be honest, the peeling feet pictures are not for the weak :) .. but oddly extremely satisfying.

I bought it hoping it would at least somewhat work, as so many don't. This is absolutely perfection! It works well, it's quiet, small, easy to take with you if you so desire, and most importantly...IT WORKS!!! I'm a soon-to-be-65-year-old\u00a0woman who has hair where I never did before, most annoying. This gets rid of it.

I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\"\u00a0 Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals\/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft, but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $8.91\u00a0(also available as a four-pack).\u00a0 Just presoak feet, apply the gel, let sit for 5\u201310 minutes, and rinse!

Bought this thinking it would work pretty average or similar to others I had used. I was sooo wrong. It is literally the most amazing product ever. It works SO WELL! Usually, it takes me a good 15\u201320 minutes at least to achieve somewhat of a soft heal. Enter this, it took me five minutes tops. I\u2019ve never had softer feet!

Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress.

I had gastric sleeve surgery and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on) and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever. I still use it twice a week and love it! I\u2019m not in love with the way it smells but others love it when they smell my hair.\" \u2014Diane J.

I have been dealing with dandruff for almost 10 years, fortunately not that heavy but enough where it was embarrassing. I tried everything. Leave in conditioner, tea tree oil, Head and Shoulders, etc. One brand did work for a couple of days but that's it. But this product has worked EFFECTIVELY. Dandruff-free for two months so far.

Intimate Rose is a small biz creating wellness products, like dilators, weights, supplements, and more that help treat issues and pain related to the pelvic floor.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Since starting, my bladder control has significantly improved. I am now able to sneeze or cough without peeing myself. Yes, that's right. I am able to hold my pee longer, which means I can actually make it to the bathroom without dribbling on myself. The best part is that just a few short weeks into the program you will have results you can feel. I think every woman who has ever had kids should try this, out. The overall quality of my life has improved. Ditch your panty liners, stop the embarrassing dribbles, no more dashes to the restroom because of a weak bladder. Even my sex life has improved; I have control of those pelvic muscles now. Just remember to wash the weights before and after each use with an antibacterial spray, and allow time to air dry before putting them away. I say air dry because if you wipe them dry with a cloth you run the risk of giving yourself a bladder infection or urinary tract infection, and those are no laughing matter. Easy to use, easy to clean, stores away quickly.\" \u2014Lady Tauber Get a set of six weights from Amazon for $49.99\u00a0(also available as a set of two).

My oral hygiene is great (tongue scraping, brushing, flossing, etc.), but I have\u00a0allergies\u00a0and constantly have a bit of post-nasal drip, which contributes to the bad breath. While this stuff isn't perfect, and my breath doesn't stay fresh all day, it is definitely the longest-lasting product I have tried so far. It is the first thing I have tried that still gives me that minty feeling when I breathe deep 4\u20136 hours after using it. I've found that gargling and using the TheraBreath throat spray in addition to rinsing with this have greatly improved my breath. Will definitely be buying again.\" \u2014Alex Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.57\u00a0(also available in mild mint).

If you are looking at it and thinking about it, YOU NEED IT.\u00a0And this stuff. Is. Awesome. Literally chunks of ear wax came out of my ear holes the SIZE OF CORN KERNELS. Where was this coming from? Why is my body making so much wax? Where was it being stored, because I did NOT think ear canals were that spacious, but apparently there are some storage closets in there or something because HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD the ear nuggets are real.\u00a0My ears feel so squeaky clean!\u00a0And get this, my hair makes sounds.

Despite all the rave reviews I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and make a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again \u2014 these are worth every damn penny.\u00a0 Psst \u2014 just note that airlines will still enforce weight limits, so don't fly TOO close to the sun packing these up!!\u00a0 Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.97.\u00a0 The color adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a\u00a0TikTok\u00a0promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it.\" \u2014Monica T.\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in two shades).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I used these several times for the past year, traveling for business and leisure. It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag\/or small backpack pocket. The portable chargers take about 30\u201335 minutes to fully charge if dead. Once charged, they charge fast and hold a charge for many hours.\" \u2014J Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in seven colors and in two-packs).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great and with the price point I don\u2019t have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!\" \u2014Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $19.99 (clip the $2 off coupon on the product page for this price; available in seven sets, as well as two-packs and individual pairs).\u00a0 I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and\u00a0they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run. They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some \"yikes!\" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough.\u00a0 Promising review: \"These socks are designed perfectly for\u00a0running\u00a0socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you. The size is true to fit.\u00a0 I've purchased many packs of these and they are the best I've tried.\" \u2014SmokeyBear Get a pack of six from Amazon for $16.95+ (available in four color combos and sizes S\u2013L). Purity is a small business that specializes in tech products and accessories.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I've tried soooo many different types of earbuds over the years with no success. But these Purity open-air headphones are the first pair I've ever tried that actually fit well, don't hurt, and sound great! So, after many years of trying, I've FINALLY found the right ones for my ears!! Woohoo! They are comfortable, lightweight, have great sound clarity, are easy to operate, have great battery life, and people can hear me clearly when I talk on the phone with them.\u00a0\u00a0I definitely recommend these, especially if regular in-ear buds don't work for you either.\" \u2014CPic Get it from Amazon for $14.59 (available in 14 styles).\u00a0 Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products.\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched.\u00a0Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive.\" \u2014Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $8.99.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I got these to help motivate me to write in a journal to help my mental health.

Joesoef Skin Care is a small business that specializes in anti-acne skincare products.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I recently saw a dermatologist talk about those clogged pores on and around your nose. If they are of uniform size, they aren't blackheads. She suggested using a sulfur soap to get rid of or minimize those stubborn clogged pores. This has a slight sulfur smell, it is not overwhelming and it disappears when dried. It works! My pores are much smaller. After applying and drying, moisturize.\" \u2014Sandy G Get it from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in multipacks).\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers! They are simple to use, cheap to refill, and catch a ton of small bugs and flies. I have eight of them now, all around my house!

This feels absolutely amazing going on. Gets absorbed quickly, for a lotion rich with oil. Doesn't leave a greasy feeling, as long as you give it a minute or two to fully absorb. The scent is, for me anyway, like aromatherapy. It smells like an iced sugar cookie, and is a great base layer for fragrance. Very relaxing.\" \u2014Dragonheart Jo Get it from Amazon for $8.98.\u00a0\u00a0 Read more about how biotin shampoo could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic. Maple Holistics is a small business that specializes in beauty products with all-natural ingredients. Check out a TikTok of the biotin shampoo in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I love this shampoo! I had gastric sleeve surgery, and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo, as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it, but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on), and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever.\"\u00a0\u2014Diane J. Huff Get it from Amazon for $11.95. Promising review: \"I have ordered this twice now. If my skin is breaking out I just spray this on after washing my face and let it air dry. It is non irritating and non drying. It has a light chlorine smell to me. I can use both morning and night with no irritation. After a few days of this my skin starts clearing up! I put some in a travel spray bottle and take it when I\u2019m flying. My skin always feels dirty on planes and I spray it on a few times on travel days to freshen my face and hopefully kill some bacteria. It sprays over makeup with no issues.\" \u2014SaraSmile11 Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$17.46.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I've gone through several sunscreens to wear with makeup, and this has been the best for me. I'm a simple girl. I apply this with vitamin C cream, let it absorb then apply my It Cosmetics CC cream. It acts like a primer for me, and my CC glides nicely over it, no pilling, no heavy or cakey feeling. It's def lightweight but provides great protection.\" \u2014Emily Haynes\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $14.12.\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the foot masks in action.\u00a0 I'm a long-ish distance runner, and these were certainly an interesting experience for my feet! You slide them on and, after a few minutes, feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. After that, my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in.\u00a0The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days!\u00a0 Promising review: \"Very soothing. My husband and l used these on our European vacation, and they definitely felt good on our feet!\" \u2014KS2018 Get a set of three pairs from Amazon for $11.97.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"I saw this product on\u00a0TikTok\u00a0and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn\u2019t lie \u2014\u00a0spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner.\u00a0Usually, I\u2019ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, including soap scum. I\u2019ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then will take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise, it\u2019s a worthy cleaning staple in my house.\" \u2014Tara D.\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $19.31.\u00a0\u00a0 Promising review: \"I purchased this because I saw them all over\u00a0TikTok. As someone with chronic illness I honestly carry around like 10 different pill bottles for 'just in case' situations. This little pill box is a great size, I love that it\u2019s magnetic and each little compartment fits a good amount of pills. It won\u2019t fit a ton of Tums if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, but the amount of space this has saved in my bag is amazing!\" \u2014Jasmin Salas Get it from Amazon for $9.99.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Saves me from auto logouts! My brother recommended this handy gadget. I work from home and have three monitors. When I leave my desk for lunch, the computer goes to sleep and when I come back, everything is logged out and whatever was on three monitors ends up on two. SO frustrating. This is programmable for three settings and I use it on the minimal movement so when I come back, everything is just as I left it. Revolutionary! Just remember to turn it on!\" \u2014Isaiah Get it from Amazon for $8.99.\u00a0 Mouthwatchers\u00a0is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in\u00a0antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with \"great\" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines.\u00a0 I've had one of these for awhile and I love it! I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these??\u00a0Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"This was another one of my\u00a0TikTok\u00a0purchases!\u00a0I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth, so I thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazingly!\u00a0My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use, and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard, those tiny bristles really get in there, and if you push too hard, you might be sore like I was. It felt like after going to a dental cleaning.\" \u2014Amy N.\u00a0 Get a two-pack from Amazon for $8.91.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"First off, if you have extremely oily skin, this. is. it. I was so tired of getting blotting powder\/wipes. It felt wasteful and always left residue on my face. I saw this on TikTok and NEEDED it. It was back ordered, but then I got an email saying it was in stock, and I was SO excited. Not only is it affordable, but it's washable, which helps you save money and be less wasteful.\" \u2014Kelsey B.

This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I\u2019ve used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!\u201d \u2014Amazon Customer\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $9.97\u00a0(available in 16 styles).

Need a shoe cleaner? PERFECT for sneakers. I could name a million more uses, but I can ASSURE you this is worth every penny. What\u2019s more? You need such LITTLE of this product, it will last a VERY long time. Thank you, TikTok!!!\" \u2014Rachel in CLT Get it from Amazon for $5.29. Hello, that is my face above, because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time.  Promising review: \"AWESOME. I\u2019ve always bought overpriced mascara. I\u2019m very picky and hesitant, but I saw some reviews saying how awesome this was. I\u2019ll never go back to 'Better Than Sex' mascara because that\u2019s what I always use, and I\u00a0compare\u00a0it to that. This is the best mascara!!

Now I\u2019m able to light candles where the candle wax has melted down, and it\u2019s hard to reach inside the jar.

I definitely recommend this.\" \u2014Cassandra S.\u00a0 \"Another product I got from\u00a0TikTok. It\u2019s a necessity. No more struggling and almost burning yourself. Stays charged for days.

I\u2019ve used whitening strips before but those usually hurt my sensitive teeth and I hate the taste of some of the other gels on the market but this one was super easy and didn\u2019t hurt my teeth at all and didn\u2019t taste much different than my regular toothpaste, since I got the mint-flavored one. I used it for a few weeks before my brother\u2019s wedding and it worked like a charm. I noticed visible results in only a couple of days and was able to keep using it until I reached my desired shade of white. 10\/10 would recommend for anyone with sensitive teeth and tastes!\" \u2014Victoria Bravo Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.96.\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the salad scissors in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Love these!

The price of 10 headbands is about the same as I have paid for one name-brand headband, so I was expecting sub-standard quality. But they are really great. I've worn them and washed them, and they are holding up well. They stay in place when I am working out hard or running. They are great at absorbing sweat, too.\u00a0They probably stay in place a little better than the\u00a0expensive\u00a0headbands I have. The colors\/designs are super nice, too.

It works great, but I probably need some practice with it. I currently just floss my hair through it so it will hold them and there are a few stray hairs that don't stick.

Love everything about the zero-gravity chair! This is my first experience sitting in a chair like this... and I love it. I fell asleep outside, and it felt better than a hammock. I bought the beige... love the color. The fabric feels like a tough nylon. It has already rained on my chair, so I can attest that the chair is waterproof. The water beads off the fabric.

I just use a regular wall, so I assume it would look even better on an actual screen. The video is at 135 inches and the quality is pretty good (looks better in person). It\u2019s like having a movie theater at home. I use some old speakers and they work perfectly. 100% recommended.

The\u00a0setup\/take down is super easy, and the frame is very sturdy\u00a0\u2014 we have definitely put 300-plus pounds in it.\u00a0 The ability to raise and lower the hammock with the multiple hook positions might be the best feature.\u00a0I have bad knees and like to get into the hammock from a higher position...no problem. My kids like it lower so they can reach the ground to swing it...no problem.\u00a0 It works great as a traditional hammock to lie in. It works as a 'swing' to sit on. It has enough fabric that you can cover up if you're cold or want to block out light or bugs.\u00a0 We have accidentally left it out in the rain several times, and it dries great,\u00a0hasn't faded from the sun, hasn't had any mold, and hasn't developed any weird smell. Things not to love: Nothing! This is a great hammock. It may not be as portable as those little nylon hammocks, but if this is for your yard and not for camping, this is hard to beat.\" \u2014Mary Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$63.99+\u00a0(available in a a variety of colors\/patterns).

Promising review: \"I\u2019m impressed with these. Assembly was very easy and took little time. I assembled them inside my house and moved them out to the garden afterward. These are good weight to them, even when empty. They feel and look like a high quality product. I used a staple gun and lightly tacked the liner up to the edges of the bed. This made the beds much simpler to fill with soil. A few days after filling with soil and seeds, we had six days of all-day, non-stop rain. The beds held up beautifully and show no signs of wear. I am currently growing a whole crop of gourds in the beds. These are performing beautifully. I am thinking I will buy one or two more.

I warmed up leftover brisket in a skillet and tossed a little of this on it at the end, and let it caramelize, and it was outrageously good.

It\u2019s easy to use, easy to clean, and best of all it makes some amazing ice cream. For best results on the consistency of your ice cream I recommend not filling it to full capacity. I always go 1.75 quarts, since some ingredients make the ice cream expand and spill over the edge. I also freeze the container a day prior to using it. I wouldn\u2019t attempt to make more than one batch in one day, the container needs to be as cold as possible.\" \u2014Beatriz Get it from Amazon for $79.95\u00a0(available in three colors).

The linen squares are good but you have to keep them around (aka keep replacing them) and they end up in the landfill. This little contraption really works and I just rinse it at the end of the day and start over\u00a0again\u00a0the next. I keep one in my desk and\u00a0bought\u00a0a second for my purse.

Love the colors too!\" \u2014Vivian Get a four-pair set from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in seven color combinations). Promising review: \"Best thing I have ever bought for my kitchen. Say goodbye to the heinous noise of slamming cabinets. My mother is notorious for just letting go of the cabinets and letting them slam shut, so before she came to visit I installed these and I couldn't have been happier. They keep the noise to a minimum and likely help to improve the longevity of the cabinet doors by reducing the impact. They are easy to install (although time consuming for all the cabinets in the kitchen) and mine have not fallen off after five months of use. When installing, I pressed them onto the cabinet hard for a 30 count before letting go. I think this is required to make them long-lasting. My father installed these at his home after he visited and his fell off because he just placed them on the cabinets like a sticker. After installing a second with the same method I used, he has not had any fall off.\" \u2014Dave Carlson Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$9.88. Hair Tie Hub is a small business that specializes in hair tie organizing keychains.

I\u2019ve been looking for something like this for years. I always forget 10 minutes later if I actually took my medicine or just put it down. I\u2019ve tried so many different ways, making marks on the bottle, making stickers, and other pill containers. None ever work. And pill containers are so bulky when I only need one pill.\" \u2014Niki Get a pack of five from Amazon for $19.99\u00a0(available in three colors). Promising review: \"This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo\/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you thank you thank you! Sincerely, all the grateful tatas you've helped to care for\" \u2014Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in sizes M\u2013XXL and in three colors or a multicolored pack).\u00a0 Promising review: \"This simple item has made my life easier. It is extremely easy to install and to use. It has increased my productivity in the office when needing to refer to a hard document. When not in use, you can easily hide it behind your screen.

Promising review: \"I have a giant, 40-oz.\u00a0Owala stainless-steel bottle and a giant stainless steel Stanley brand coffee mug that fit beautifully in this cup holder extender! Now, my bottle isn't rolling around on the floor or all the way in the backseat where I can't reach it. I can actually enjoy drinking my coffee again instead of sealing it up and waiting until I get to work to drink it. It's expensive but it's well made and easy to put together. I really want a second one for my other car but I'm not sure I can justify the expense for the short amount of time I spend in that car!\" \u2014Vixxm Get it from Amazon for $26.99+\u00a0(available in three sizes).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I used these several times for the past year, traveling for business and leisure. It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag\/or small backpack pocket. The portable chargers take about 30\u201335 minutes to fully charge if dead.

In fact, because you get five pairs, I put a set on my glasses, and I'll be darned if they don't work really well. They add a little bit of bulk to your glasses so if you're extremely fashion-conscious, it's not like tape-on-the-bridge nerdy, but it's there. But if you're more concerned about having your glasses feel like they're going to stay put on your head, then you'll like these. They aren't too thick so you don't really notice them on your ears. In fact, because of the soft silicone, they actually result in less of the occasional soreness I would get from my glasses on my ears sometimes.\" \u2014Domenico Bettinelli Get a pack of five pairs from Amazon for $6.99 (available in three colors).

It\u2019s easy to use and saves so many dog bags if you\u2019re taking a number of dogs on a walk because you don\u2019t need to open a new bag for each poop. It also makes the whole process a lot less gross. I would 100% recommend this for dog walks and even picking up poop in the backyard. It holds a lot more than you\u2019d think!\" \u2014Joslyn Cavitt Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in two sizes and four colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"TikTok made me buy it but I'm not mad about it. This is a good size turntable that makes it easy to see everything in it.

TBH, you can even pop a hot coffee cup into this to keep it warm, so the Frostbuddy is technically also a Hotbuddy.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I absolutely love this! I use this all the time for my coffee from Starbucks, and it is amazing! I'll get iced coffee at 9 a.m. and still have ice in it at 7 p.m. I have many Frostbuddy products now, and their entire line is phenomenal. This is definitely a must-have item for coffee or tea drinkers. I love that it also comes with a leakproof lid, so you can put your own drink in there, too.

Promising review:\u00a0\"I just tried these last weekend at an outdoor wedding with an indoor reception. They were amazing! I kept them on all night.\u00a0First, I walked outside in thick grass, and the wedding photos were taken in a mushy grassy area. I didn't sink even a little bit. It was fantastic.\u00a0My heels were fabulous. I then decided to leave them on for the rest of the night since they made my heels more stable and comfortable. So glad I tried them. I was showing them off to the other ladies, and everyone loved the look of them.\" \u2014J L D Get a pair on Amazon for\u00a0$11.99\u00a0(available in four sizes).

I did find it necessary to reapply if I took my shoes off and put them on again.\" \u2014Donna Get it from Amazon for $9. Promising review: \"Very handy when traveling or at the gym! I got this one after getting a different brand that is smaller. I love the extra pockets on this and the roomie section for ANY water bottle or a smaller water bottle and other stuff. The zipped pocket holds my iPhone Max just fine. Just took this on a cruise and several people commented wishing they had one. So much easier than a backpack or something for your water bottle.\" \u2014Judy Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in 14 colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I love these. I have a few cute summer dresses with sleeves \u2014 eeek! The first time I tried the shields it was 104 degrees at an outdoor event, and I was sweating bullets! The shields worked BEAUTIFULLY.

Promising review: \"Because of my job, I live out of a suitcase, and I am always worried if I need an extra set of contacts or a spare pair of eyeglasses. This is perfect, because I just put it in the bottom of my suitcase, and I am confident I have them both in one place. I got the pink case, and it\u2019s very cute.

Wallaroo Wallets is a small business that specializes in uniquely-designed minimalist wallets.\u00a0 Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer\u00a0Emma Lord has to say about it: \"I've used these wallets for four years now, and they are worth every penny! Mine last about six months at a time before they get dingy enough to replace, and easily hold three cards and a five dollar bill. I've never had any issues with them un-sticking off the phone case, and they're super easy to pull off. It makes my life so much easier not to carry a wallet around, plus I never lose my ID!\" Promising review: \"The Wallaroo phone wallet is a must have for any cell phone owner. The quality of the leather and design of the wallet is superb. I recently went on vacation and purchased my Walleroo before my\u00a0trip.

It took me a while to figure out the best angle to get him out with it but once I did I went to the nail shop expeditiously!! Lol If you\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while, GET IT!

The best egg container on Amazon! How can I say that? Easy! Engineering! The slight tilt angle on the bottom of the container that the egg drawer sits on forces eggs to lightly roll forward, keeping all your eggs in the front, and never in the back, where you don't need them. It's super easy to use, so easy to clean, comes apart and can hold a full can organizer on top without issue, so no issues with sturdiness. It can easily hold 14 large eggs. Easily one of my favorite purchases.\" \u2014Karingen Get it from Amazon for $15.99.\u00a0 Reviewers love this because it doesn't require you to \"smart enable\" other parts of your home.

Our front walkway gets pretty dark at night, and I was frustrated with trying to remember to turn on the light every evening and off every morning. I looked into those light sensors you can plug in, but our front porch light is under an awning with enough shade that it would have kept the light on 24\/7. This little Switchbot solved the problem. I applied it to the indoor light switch and set the time on my phone. It has worked perfectly ever since.\" \u2014Alecia McLochlin Get it from Amazon for $29 (available in white and black).\u00a0 It comes with an optional adjustable swivel base! Promising review: \"I got this on a\u00a0whim\u00a0that it would improve my driving experience, and it has significantly. I did not attach the swivel base as others had mentioned in these reviews, and my experience has been great. Lets you see your blind spot pretty well.

I bought the beige... love the color. The fabric feels like a tough nylon. It has already rained on my chair, so I can attest that the chair is waterproof. The water beads off the fabric.

I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get, especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014JG Get it from Amazon for $44.99.

Just add your propane tank. I love that it has a lid as well. You will find sturdier fire tables, but not at this price. Excellent value.\" \u2014MGF Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$156.99+\u00a0(available in five sizes\/styles). You can order this with or without the sand and rocks.

Was simple to set up, I got a little electric pump and it took about 10 minutes to inflate, then about half an hour to fill with water. Pay attention to make sure you set it up on level ground or it will be lopsided. I live in South Carolina so it is already hot and humid, and I use it about every afternoon. It is probably good for two adults, maybe one adult and a couple of kids. The built-in seat and headrest are really quite comfy and relaxing. I will definitely buy this same pool again if it springs a leak and can't be fixed, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!!\" \u2014Kathryn J. Get it from Amazon for $45.99.

The tool-free installation is as simple as opening the unit and camping it onto the umbrella pole. It requires four AA batteries to run, which are not included.\u00a0 Promising review: \"This light is great!!! It has three settings to adjust the amount of brightness you need. Lowest level is great for just sitting around your patio table and having a couple of drinks with friends. Brightest setting is PERFECT for playing cards! We play cards a few times a month. There are two 70+-year-olds who did not complain that they couldn\u2019t see. So, works great in my book! \ud83d\ude01\" \u2014Mandie Jordan Get it from Amazon for $10.99.

A worthwhile purchase.\" \u2014RL Baker Get it from Amazon for $129.99\u00a0(available in three colors and three styles). Promising review: \"These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly. They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall.\" \u2014A.Consumer Get a set of four from Amazon for $16.99\u00a0(also available as a set of eight).

Plus, the stand is easy to assemble, disassemble, and pack up in the included carrying case for storage or travel. Promising review: \"Features to love: The cotton fabric is sturdy and breathable. I never feel stuck to it the way I do in a nylon hammock. The setup\/take down is super easy and the frame is very sturdy \u2014 we have definitely put 300+ pounds in it. The ability to raise and lower the hammock with the multiple hook positions might be the best feature. I have bad knees and like to get into the hammock from a higher position... no problem. My kids like it lower so they can reach the ground to swing it... no problem. It works great as a traditional hammock to lay in. It works as a 'swing' to sit on. It has enough fabric that you can cover up if you're cold or want to block out light or bugs. We have accidentally left it out in the rain several times and it dries great, hasn't faded from the sun, hasn't had any mold, and hasn't developed any weird smell. Things not to love: Nothing! This is a great hammock. It may not be as portable as those little nylon hammocks but if this is for your yard and not for camping, this is hard to beat.\" \u2014Mary Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$63.99+ (available in 17 colors).

Bought it because I was sick of waiting for my husband to power wash the patio with the gas power washer that is too bulky and difficult for me to maneuver comfortably. Between the pull string, gas, oil \u2013agh! No thanks. This was fabulous \u2013 easy to maneuver and did a great job on my huge patio and walkways. Did it in small batches over two days. This is a GREAT option for folks who can sacrifice a little more time to do the job versus the back-breaking lugging and annoying refilling of the gas power washers. Totally recommend!\" \u2014Sarah Get it from Amazon for $246.83. Promising review: \"This is the second privacy screen I've purchased from Amazon. I have an area in my garden visible from the street.

BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review:\u00a0\"I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue. Since my bathroom color scheme isn't on the blue spectrum, this is problematic. The well water also causes the shower glass to film up quickly.\u00a0I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed till my arms ached trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess. My ambition in life is NOT to be a full time bathroom scrubber!\u00a0I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's\u00a0TikTok\u00a0(sorry, don't remember which one) and thought 'what the heck, might as well give it a try.'\u00a0Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue and the glass looked clearer too. Day two, sprayed again and walked away. The next morning the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile and the glass looked amazing. Day three I sprayed the remaining spots and the next morning the shower practically looked new.\u00a0NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner.\u00a0The ONLY con I have is that it makes me sneeze while I'm spraying from inside the shower, but I can live with that.\" \u2014L. J.

With every shower I take, I shed a TON of hair and (as you can see from the picture) stick it to the wall so that no hair goes down my drain. I thought this method was working out well but my drain was continuing to stop up. I figured it must be my sister's fault since I was so good about not letting any hairs go down the drain, but I went ahead ordered the TubShroom after seeing advertisements on Facebook. I got this thing and after only two showers, it collected a crap ton of my hair that I didn't catch. It really is so easy to install and wipe away the hair, exactly like the videos. Awesome invention and I'm super happy with this purchase!\" \u2014Megan K.

For reference, I had very long, thick hair and it takes a while to air-dry \u2014 and I'm so happy I found this scrunchie! It's a lot bigger in person than it looks in the image, which is great because it covers more of your hair to help dry it.

So I knew that a long road trip was going to be a disaster. I was amazed at how well these bands worked for everyone! Not one single person complained about being sick for 12 hours in the car. At one point I did have one child remove their bands because they said they were getting too tight. But after only a few minutes without them, a headache started to come on, so they immediately put them back on and the\u00a0relief\u00a0was\u00a0instant.

I purchased this vacuum and have been very pleased with it. Its slim design gets under the dressers, beds, other furniture, and all the tight spaces that I couldn't get to with an upright vacuum cleaner. This makes a very low sound while in use, and honestly, I don't even realize it's operating, as the sound is pleasant (not loud at all).\" \u2014Teach3 Get it from Amazon for $199.99\u00a0(available in two colors).

I\u2019ve had my Levoit air purifier in my bedroom for over three years and can attest to how great it works. I feel a noticeable difference in how my respiratory system feels during the inversions, wildfires (smoky air), and\u00a0allergy\u00a0season \u2014 if I don\u2019t run the air purifier at night, I almost always notice an uptick in nasal congestion and respiratory irritation. The filters are very reasonably priced and the device is not too loud\u2014it provides a nice amount of white noise as a backdrop for sleeping.

Need a shoe cleaner? PERFECT for sneakers. I could name a million more uses, but I can ASSURE you this is worth every penny. What\u2019s more? You need such LITTLE of this product, it will last a VERY long time. Thank you, TikTok!!!\" \u2014Rachel in CLT Get it from Amazon for $5.29. Promising review:\u00a0\"I saw this product on\u00a0TikTok\u00a0and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn\u2019t lie \u2014\u00a0spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner.\u00a0Usually, I\u2019ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, including soap scum. I\u2019ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then will take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise, it\u2019s a worthy cleaning staple in my house.\" \u2014Tara D.\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $19.88.\u00a0\u00a0 The color adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a\u00a0TikTok\u00a0promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it.\" \u2014Monica T.\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in two shades).\u00a0 I love love love this lip balm.\u00a0I compare it to the\u00a0$24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on \u2014\u00a0I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go.\u00a0It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss\u00a0whether I'm using it alone or on top of lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the\u00a0birthday cake flavor that Glossier\u00a0sometimes carries.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home. These just feel so good on your lips! The flavors are very true to their name. They are pretty small though, so if you use it often it won\u2019t last long (which is another reason I have three of them), but for $4 each it is worth it. I sometimes like using this before putting on the E.l.f. Lip Reviver Oil. Such a great base to an awesome lip oil!\" \u2014Jax Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five flavors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I've gone through several sunscreens to wear with make-up, and this has been the best for me. I'm a simple girl. I apply this with vitamin C cream, let it absorb, and then apply my It Cosmetics CC cream.\u00a0It acts like a primer for me, and my CC glides nicely over it with no pilling, no heavy or cakey feeling.\u00a0It's def lightweight but provides great protection.\" \u2014Emily Haynes\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $13.53.\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the foot masks in action.\u00a0 I'm a long-ish distance runner, and these were certainly an interesting experience for my feet! You slide them on and, after a few minutes, feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. After that, my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in.\u00a0The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days!\u00a0 Promising review: \"Very soothing. My husband and l used these on our European vacation, and they definitely felt good on our feet!\" \u2014KS2018 Get a set of three pairs from Amazon for $14.37.\u00a0 Reviewers who run or sweat a lot during workouts especially swear by these, because the flexible ear loops lock them in place!\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the open-air earbuds in action.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Amazing sound quality! I have owned many headphones and none have been as good as these. There's always the problem with the in-ear ones that they tend to fall off, and the over-ear-ones are just too bulky or hurt to wear for long periods of time. And most importantly being able to wear them not only for audio but for calls too and have a good microphone. These headphones cover all of the above and more. They are lightweight, they don't bother my ears in any way, they don't fall off, they have a good mic, and no sound leaking at all!!!! Best purchase I've done! Now I'm tempted to try other headphones from Tozo.\" \u2014Cliente de Kindle\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $49.99 (clip the $20 off coupon on the product page for this price; available in four colors).\u00a0 Note that the the noise-canceling is 95% \u2014 ideal for keeping ears out for traffic and kid noises, if need be, but not 100% like the Apple version.\u00a0 Check out a TikTok of the headphones in action.\u00a0 Here's what BuzzFeeder Maitland Quitmeyer has to say about these headphones: \"I actually just bought these after featuring them for the first time \u2014 I've been considering buying AirPods Max, but I am very particular about how headphones fit \u2014 and am sensitive to my ears overheating after wearing certain on-ear headphones for too long. So instead of (or before) committing to the $500 version, I thought trying these for a test run would be good. Turns out, I love them so far! They're super comfortable and do *not* make my ears overheat. The sound quality to my non-expert ears is excellent too! And the noise-canceling is right for me \u2014 it blocked out annoying street noise so I could be fully immersed in my tunes.\"\u00a0 Promising review: \"These headphones are surprisingly awesome. I was rather impressed with the quality, considering the price. They are easy to pair, came charged, and are super cute. People have actually asked me if they were the AirPods Max.\u00a0I also really like how you can pause\/skip & adjust the volume on the headphones (which many headphones lack). Noise-canceling is pretty good. I can\u2019t hear very much when I play music. When there\u2019s no music, they still cancel a lot, but not everything, like most headphones. I do wish they could get a little louder, but they still have great sound quality. 4.5\/5\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get them from Amazon for $69.99.

Despite all the rave reviews I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and make a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again \u2014 these are worth every damn penny.\u00a0 Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.88.\u00a0 Joesoef Skin Care is a small business that specializes in anti-acne skincare products.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I recently saw a dermatologist talk about those clogged pores on and around your nose. If they are of uniform size, they aren't blackheads. She suggested using a sulfur soap to get rid of or minimize those stubborn clogged pores.

I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these??\u00a0Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.\u00a0 Promising review:\u00a0\"This was another one of my\u00a0TikTok\u00a0purchases!\u00a0I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth, so I thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazingly!\u00a0My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use, and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard, those tiny bristles really get in there, and if you push too hard, you might be sore like I was.

When I tell you this product makes my skin so soft and so even, it\u2019s an understatement! My skin is usually very dry, oily (acne-prone), and super sensitive, so it\u2019s really hard for me to find something that can be hydrating but gentle at the same time. The product itself is creamy\/slime consistency, and sometimes you do have to work it in a little bit to absorb.\u00a0After about 5\u201310 minutes, the product fully absorbs, and you\u2019re all set!\u00a0I use it after I apply their brand of hyaluronic acid.\" \u2014May Get it from Amazon for $15.99.\u00a0\u00a0 Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes.\u00a0 Promising review: \"This is such a great candle that fills the room quickly with a really nice strong smell that is soothing and relaxing.

It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag\/or small backpack pocket.

It is so comfortable to use; I have shoulder problems, so that is important. I've used it for about a month now, which is longer than the $$$ one from Williams Sonoma, which died an ugly death. And it doesn't twist forcibly and hurt my shoulder like others I've had. So I am very impressed.

The 12-ounce Stojo cup I purchased is very practical. It is thick and durable. The plastic collar enables you to hold the cup without squeezing it or burning your hands on the hot walls of the cup.\u00a0There is enough volume in the cup to allow for the 12-ounce brew plus ample creamer. It's not a stainless vacuum cup, but it does hold its temperature better than your typical gas station or coffee shop cup. Plus you have the advantage of being able to reheat your drink in the microwave which you can't do with a stainless cup. \u00a0\u2014ViciousCycle Get it from Amazon for $14.95+\u00a0(available in four sizes and 24 colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"Soooo pretty.

However, if I could give this pressure cooker a 10 out of 5 stars, I would. So far I\u2019ve cooked a whole chicken, beans and rice, working on baby rack ribs, and a few other things. The best feature is all dishes I\u2019ve cooked have taken no more than one hour. I have yet to try vegetables, but parsnips are in the near future as are beats. Only criticism would be to invest in some kind of trivet to keep the meat you\u2019re cooking out of the liquid.

I have curly hair which I love but sometimes I just want to put it in a ponytail and go on with my day. This is a time saver for all those little hairs that tend to stick up or don't want to stay in place. I\u2019m not a fan of hairspray, and this even smells nice. I believe it\u2019s a light coconut smell. Overall satisfied, and you don\u2019t need to use much.

I\u2019m the person who gets bitten while everyone else is fine. They follow me, and most repellent isn\u2019t very helpful. This worked great! They came near but didn\u2019t bite. The smell isn\u2019t bad either! I didn\u2019t mind it, and my sister has requested some also (she gets bitten even more than I do). I would have preferred a continuous spray nozzle, but I\u2019m very impressed with how well it kept those dang mosquitoes away in Texas!

I was skeptical about any kind of balm as I figured that it would leave a mess on my floors or one\/both dogs would just lick it off their feet.\u00a0No problems whatsoever, and after a single application, both dogs' pads are really soft and supple.\u00a0Hopefully the dogs can feel the difference.

They were actually so much more comfortable than I could have imagined. They didn\u2019t rub like some of the booties do. We walked 10 miles a day, right out to package. No blisters or discomfort. I would recommend them to anyone. You must wear socks with them, so plan for sizing accordingly. I logged 40k steps in these boots and now use them as daily barn boots.

The company is now based in Portland, Oregon. Promising review: \"This towel dries better than a conventional towel! Not only that but it was completely dry and ready to reuse in about 10 minutes. Normally we'd go through a stack of beach towels in one day. The towel itself is big but it packs up compact leaving more room in your bag for other things.

Chub rub has always been a part of my life and until now, I didn't have a great way of preventing it. I've tried various sport shorts and slathering my thighs in deodorant but those methods just weren't cutting it. These shorts are unbelievably lightweight and breathable, superrrrrr stretchy (but not in a way that bags out after extended wear), and they do. not. roll. or. fall. down. I wear them under all of my skirts and dresses (because I also have an irrational fear that everything I wear is see-through when the sun hits it) and I will definitely be buying more!\" Promising review: \"It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say these shorts are life changing. I\u2019m a chubby living in hot, steamy Florida. Chub rub is inevitable when wearing skirts and dresses. I\u2019ve tried a number of lady boxers and petit pants. They all either rolled up, down, or one leg rode up. They were also hot and non breathable. These shorts are perfection. No more chub rub, no more swamp a$$! I\u2019m in love. I wish there were more color choices!\" \u2014Rachel Get a pair from Thigh Society for $39 (available in women's sizes XS\u20136XL, in six lengths, and 10 colors).\u00a0 Comes in multiple sizes (depending on your make and model) with a money-back guarantee.

My GMC Denali sits outside in the Southeastern NC sun all day and this really made a difference. When I get into my truck I can actually sit on the leather seats without being burned.

It is a higher end umbrella but still slightly less expensive than the other big name designer beach gear company that we were considering. It is easy to pop up and stays standing, and we\u2019ve had many compliments from other people at the beach asking where we got it. The customer service from the company was excellent. Would definitely recommend these umbrellas!\" \u2014Taryn Get it from Amazon for $99.99+\u00a0(available in seven colors).\u00a0 Note that this includes just the umbrella, not the table!

It has three settings, to adjust the amount of brightness you need. Lowest level is great for just sitting around your\u00a0patio\u00a0table and having a couple of drinks with friends. Brightest setting is PERFECT for playing cards! We play cards a few times a month. We decided to try and play outside. There are two 70+-year-olds who did not complain that they couldn\u2019t see. So, works great in my book! \ud83d\ude01\" \u2014Mandie Jordan Get it from Amazon for $10.79. Promising review: \"This is the second privacy screen I've purchased from Amazon.

Each light cycles through red, blue, white, and green. Promising review: \"My pool is so old school and boring that I bought these to liven it up, and what a difference!! My pool went from 'meh' to WOW! The balls are easily inflated by mouth like a beach ball. Once inflated, a few hours in the sun, they are charged and ready to go. They light up after dusk ( it has to be rather dark). There is no manual way to power them on or off; they glow all night long. The changing colors are vibrant and very beautiful. They have a loop at the top if you would like to hang them. They would be magical, hanging in a tree or from a pergola. I really liked how easy these were to fill and charge, and I like the solar power and the amazing color display. They make my inner child happy.\" \u2014J. Matheson Get a set of four from Amazon for $69.99. Promising review: \"Scummy water bugging you? I just got this gem of a product last night.

The rounded edges and shape make it so unique. Such incredible quality for a very, very, reasonable price.\" \u2014Barbara Cooker Get it from Amazon for $254.69+\u00a0(available in four sizes and two colors). I just got these for my bedroom and they're simply gorgeous. I am a renter, so I needed an option that didn't require any electrical work and beyond that, I HATE cords, so I wanted to avoid those as well. IMO, the best part about these is that they have rechargeable lightbulbs \u2014 so no outlets necessary! I also love the remote control which allows you to set them to a cool or warm tone, dim them, and set a timer if you want them to turn off after a certain amount of time. I consider myself pretty handy, so installing these was no big deal, but I will say, even if you're not Bob the Builder, I think it's pretty simple! All you need is a screwdriver, drill (if you want to use the wall anchors), and 20 minutes. All of the necessary hardware comes included! Get a set of two from Amazon for $89.99 (available in two finishes). Promising review: \"This was the first purchase of my new apartment and totally the best purchase.

Highly recommended.\" \u2014Priya Get it from Amazon for $259.95 (available in 23 colors). The portrait lights are battery-operated and wireless so you don't have to worry about hiring an electrician or doing any installation your self. Each unit runs off of three AAAs (get a 36-pack here before you forget!) and an included remote lets you set the light to different brightnesses and schedule a timer for 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes.  PS: If you're going for an antique look but don't have the budget to buy vintage, I saw a TikToker DIY these with some gold Rub 'n Buff metallic finish and an old makeup brush, and it looked truly incredible! Promising review: \"For the price, you can\u2019t beat it. Super easy to install and lightweight. The gold had a slight orange tint to it, so be mindful of that.

It surpassed my expectations for sure. I did see a few reviews that made me skeptical, BUT I decided to go with it. SO GLAD I DID! This is easily my favorite bed I\u2019ve owned. I have a 12-inch mattress. No box spring needed. The bed doesn\u2019t squeak at all if you just tighten the screws all the way.

I will definitely be buying more for other rooms.\" \u2014Catherine Vorce Get it from Amazon for $29.97+ (available in 11 styles). Promising review: \"Fabric is soft and very nice. Pillows have funky stuffing and definitely require a good fluffing, but this chair is certainly a comp for a higher-end one that costs well over $1,000. So it's still worth it in the end! They are very sturdy and took me almost an hour each to put together. I have a set of two.\" \u2014Victoria Get it from Amazon for $90.13+ (available individually or in a set of two and in seven colors) Promising review: \"Very pleased with these. I bought six of these chairs to go around my dining room table. They arrive completely assembled, so you just have to unpack the chair.

I thought it would be coarse and scratchy, but it's not! Love love love it! I got the 6-foot round rug, which will eventually sit under my new dining table.

I did a lot of homework on finding the perfect curtains for our new home. I needed a lot of them, something pretty, full, and good insulation. It could get very expensive. These were more than I could have wanted, and at such a great price...I ended up getting the longer ones because they cost less (I needed 12 panels). As a result of longer ones, they are fuller on the bottom, look so lovely, and I get all the compliments. My mom is a designer, and I grew up being particular about fabric and how things are made. These are well-constructed and have gorgeous lining, lots of detail put into these, thank you!!\" \u2014Mrs Get a panel from Amazon for $48.99+ (available in 29 colors and 10 sizes).

This lamp is definitely a shiny, brassy gold and not a satin, champagne-color gold, but I actually love the color! My new house has a much more vintage, Art Deco vibe than my last place, and I think it fits right in with that. The milky orbs are beautiful and make the light nice and warm.

My clothes are a mess by the end of the day. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. I have tried EVERYTHING there is to remove stains and this is the absolute BEST thing out there. (There is simply not a major stain remover that I have not tried.) The only thing close is a long pre-soak (I mean like six hours) in Oxyclean. With Puracy, you get the best result by doing it well in advance, but for me that is another plus because I would far rather spray them when I put them in the hamper than do it all at once just before I do the laundry.

Promising review: \"Say goodbye to puffiness in seconds.\u00a0I saw this on a BuzzFeed article and thought it was so cute. I've used Clinique and It Cosmetics eye creams and they are great but this is different. I like this more for morning\/pre-makeup. It absorbs in literal seconds! And it gets rid of puffiness super quickly. This is perfect for mornings. This is my new holy grail eye cream. A few swipes on the eye lip and under the eye and I'm good to go. No tapping in.\" \u2014ChrisTb Get it from Amazon for $6.83\u00a0(available in two versions). Promising review: \"Where has this stuff been in all of my 46 years! Cleaned my stove like is wasn't even dirty! I simply put a small amount on my sponge and attacked the baked-on crud! It came off easily with just a small amount of elbow grease. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Nothing like I normally have to do with spraying stinky, fuming oven cleaner and letting it sit, scrub, and then repeating over and over until it's clean! This has made my life so much better! Now off to tackle the hard water spots and soap scum in the shower!!\" \u2014Jenny\u00a0 Get it from Amazon for $5.29. Check out this TikTok of the Folex carpet spot remover to see it in action!\u00a0 Promising review: \u201cThere are products that you love and buy again. And then there are products that you love and can\u2019t live without. And then above that, are a few select products that you revere and hold with the highest honor. Folex is that product. I have used Folex for years and it works wonders on everything from spilt coffee, wine, and dog messes, without any chemical smells or residue. But my love for Folex grew so much deeper when I dropped a 32-ounce jar of salsa down the stairs. My husband took one look and declared that the stairs were ruined and would need to be replaced. I took a look, grabbed the Folex and said, 'We\u2019ve got this.' If you have children, pets or are very clumsy with your canned goods, you need this bulk-size jug in your arsenal of cleaning supplies.\u201d \u2014Carobnty Get it from Amazon for $6.65.\u00a0 Promising review: \"I love the variety of scents that linger long enough to work for the purpose intended.

I definitely recommend it!\" \u2014P Gilroy Get it from Amazon for $6.99+\u00a0(available in five colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"It does what it says: extends your bra fit for comfort and to reduce bra lines in back. It does not stretch (I found the stretchy ones didn't provide enough support). These are very soft and comfortable. I didn't realize how important that was until I ordered a different brand and they were torture \u2014 itchy and stiff and awful, even after washing. I ditched them and immediately reordered this brand so I'd always have enough on hand!\" \u2014McNally16 Get a pack of three from Amazon for $8.99+\u00a0(available in three colors and in different size options). Promising review: \"Since I started using these clips, I haven't had to pull up my straps a single time! I used to have to pull them back up a dozen times a day. No more. Now I can put on my bra and then just forget that it is there. I don't notice any change in the fit of my bra. I wear a large cup size and the last thing I wanted was to add to that. However, with the straps fully extended on my bra, I find the fit to be essentially the same as before. The only difference is that the straps stay in place. If you've ever struggled to keep your straps up, you owe it to yourself to try this product.\" \u2014K. Howe Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.97+\u00a0(available in 10 color combos). Promising review: \"This stuff works like magic. I\u2019m 33 and I\u2019ve dealt with bad back acne since I was a teenager. After one week of using this, my back is night and day different.

This is like head lice treatment. If you are looking at it and thinking about it, YOU NEED IT. And this stuff. Is. Awesome. Literally, chunks of ear wax came out of my ear holes the SIZE OF CORN KERNELS. Where was this coming from? Why is my body making so much wax? Where was it being stored because I did NOT think ear canals were that spacious, but apparently there are some storage closets in there or something because HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD the ear nuggets are real. My ears feel so squeaky clean! And get this, my hair makes sounds. Like I put it up in a hair tie afterwards, and I could HEAR MY HAIR MOVING ON MY HEAD. What is that?! Seriously?! If you also did not know that moving hair creates a sound, you need to buy this product ASAP.\" \u2014Samantha Get it from Amazon for $5.98. Promising review: \"I get a spray tan every week and removing it is my least favorite part of the process. Previously, I have used \u201cexfoliate gloves\u201d which result in scrubbing at my skin for 30 minutes, just to leave it patchy & still in tact. I used this product for the first time this evening\u2026 WOW. The entire process took 10 minutes, fully removed my tan, and left my skin feeling so soft. I wish I would have purchased this sooner and would recommend to anyone in the same situation!\" \u2014Kristin De Stefano Get it from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: \"This tape works wonders. I am trying to get a recent move paid off, so I really couldn't afford to replace screens at this point, even if I did them myself. This tape made all the difference in my house. I no longer had to leave the windows closed worrying about sitting on the couch with fly swatter in hand, or watching my cats zoom around the house trying to catch them, and knocking everything over in the process.\" \u2014MsRich2U Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in three sizes and two colors). New parents, don't panic. Cradle cap \u2014 aka\u00a0seborrheic dermatitis\u00a0\u2014 is a very common dry scalp condition that affects infants. Promising review: \"The pictures posted here are legit. It makes removal so much easier and gives more consistent removal than my previous method of washcloths or just scratching the cradle cap off with my fingernails. It\u2019s amazing and gross and wonderful. My babe doesn\u2019t even flinch when I spend 10 minutes clearing his scalp of all the goo. It seems to be soothing to him. I just apply baby shampoo, then brush a little with the blue brush. Then I slowly start to comb in sections all in one direction. Then I go back and forth in different directions. It\u2019s shocking the amount of dead skin that comes off. I\u2019ve even used it successfully in his eyebrows (he gets some cradle cap there, too). This is a KEEPER!\" \u2014ZMomUtah Get it from Amazon for $4.19. Promising reviews: \"My 3-year-old's favorite activity had become shutting our cats in rooms so they could not get out, leading us to have to stop what we were doing to come to the rescue and answer their cries for freedom dozens of times a day. These are sturdy, fit snugly, hold up to attempted slammings \u2014 they do the job! Maybe a little overpriced for some pieces of foam, but whatever \u2014 they\u2019ve made my life so much better, I\u2019d buy them all over again!\" \u2014Mandy\u00a0 Get a four-pack from Amazon for $9.95.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Saw on\u00a0TikTok\u00a0(don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart.

Promising review: \"Mosquitoes love me. I have yet to find a topical that actually helps and as much as I hated to spend $10 on this thing, it might be the best $10 I've ever spent. This thing actually works and has already saved me much itchy misery. It's easy to use and you don't need to use it immediately after the bite in order to get some relief (better if it's soon I'd say, but I've also used it hours later and it helps!).\" \u2014KrisinCO Get it from Amazon for $9.95\u00a0(available in three colors as well as multipacks). Promising review: \"New holy grail! These sponges are amazing! I've been buying the Beauty Blender for years, and as you all know, they are $20 for just one.

I never could get the rack and grates to look like new. There was always a layer of permanent food residue, carbon, and other debris that defied removal. I decided to give the Magic Stone Grill Cleaner a shot. Surprise! Surprise! This is truly a magic stone. It removed everything from the grill parts that I worked on and left them looking like new. The cleaning process did put grooves in the bottom of the stone and that helped to get the sides cleaned off as well.\" \u2014Duffer. Get it from Amazon for $6.88. Promising review: \"I bought it hoping my elderly cat would stop pestering me constantly to brush him. It was the best money ever spent.

I am 40 now. I was recently asked to go on a road trip which included day travel, busy city and mountains. (Sun, stop-and-go traffic, and winding roads are all triggers for sickness). I hesitated. It was then recommended by a family member to try these. With hesitation, I bought them and wore them the entire time. I did not feel nauseous ONE time. My boyfriend even pointed out on the way home that I was on my phone and not sick. (Reading anything while riding has ALWAYS been a no go!) I was able to look out the window and enjoy the scenery (typically I can only look at the road as looking outside the window makes me sick).

I don't shy away from wearing them even if I know I'll need to walk a bit, and they don't slip around too much on my feet like so many mules do (this was even true when I made the fashion-over-function decision to wear them on a rainy day)! The color has been surprisingly versatile and awesome for fresh looks with several jumpsuits and dresses I've had for years.

It fits perfectly, and the bodice has plenty of stretch so if you\u2019re in between sizes, you could go either way. I actually sized down because I wanted to wear it on the shoulders and didn\u2019t want the sleeves slipping off, but I didn\u2019t have an issue with that at all. I got the sage-green color and it\u2019s not see-through, it\u2019s beautiful. Get this dress!\" \u2014Laura Get it from Amazon for $38.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and in 35 colors).

We have been struggling with excessive ear wax build-up with my 4-year-old son and we tried everything else and he would cry and scream if we did anything to his ear. It took two tries but we got all the impacted earwax out. The first time I used water and apple cider vinegar and the second time just warm water. Both methods worked equally well.

Until a few months ago, I never even knew what these things were! Anyway, I've been struggling with cotton buds to fully remove the stones, but I couldn't get rid of them, and they would just come back within the week. I received this and OMFG...best investment ever. No struggle holding my phone as a flashlight while awkwardly poking myself in front of my badly lit bathroom mirror. I sat comfortably at my vanity, used one hand, and removed the whole stone in less than a minute. Why did I not know this was a thing? Why have I been struggling? Get it!

Promising review: \"I ordered this balm on a whim as a remedy for a skin rash and was very impressed with its effectiveness! After getting rid of my rash, I decided to try it elsewhere, and it worked wonders on dry skin areas like my elbows, knees, and feet. I was blown away by how I changed my feet entirely! As a dancer, my feet have always been a war zone: dry skin, callouses, ingrown toenails, and athlete's foot (all frequent problems over the course of many years). I was always embarrassed to wear sandals or any type of shoes that would show off parts of my feet because of all the dry skin, but sometimes, it couldn't be avoided. This balm has made my feet the loveliest they have been, and now I can choose any type of shoes I want to wear without embarrassment.\" \u2014anengstrom Get it from Amazon for $36.32.

I stick it on and honestly forget that it's even there. The adhesive is strong, so it stays on during my tossing and turning at night, but I often wear it during the day, too! I work from home, and it's not noticeable during my video calls, which I truly, truly appreciate. I begin seeing the gunk from my zits after two or three hours of having it covered, but I leave it on for at least the full six. When it's removed, it's like the healing time was sped up, and what would've taken a couple of days took just HOURS.\" For more deets, check out her full\u00a0Mighty Patch review!

I had no issues taking this through\u00a0TSA\u00a0and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again.\" \u2014Teresa Get it from Amazon\u00a0for $18.\u00a0 Promising reviews:\u00a0\"Holy grail product. This is an amazing product. I have sensitive skin, but this has not affected me negatively at all. This product is amazing. It took about three months for me to get wonderful results. There is a slight, somewhat medicinal smell, but I actually kind of like it. If you have scars of any kind, I would highly recommend giving this product a try. I have an old burn scar on my hand; no matter what I used it never seemed to fade in the slightest. I\u2019ve been using Bio-Oil on it for about three months now and it\u2019s made such a difference! It\u2019s basically completely gone! Such a better result than I was expecting! I was only hoping to fade it slightly.\" \u2014sarah_baerah Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$9.95+\u00a0(also available in a bundle). Promising review: \"This product is gentle on the skin, but strong enough to combat any buttock issues caused by stress, environmental issues, or whatever. Living in the Deep South, we sometimes have a condition called 'swamp butt.' Little red bumps like a rash or breakout can form in sensitive areas. Using this product once a day after showering...I've had ZERO bumps in over three months. It works. Doesn't smell the greatest, but it's tolerable, for sure. Great product.\" \u2014Billie B Get it from Amazon for $24.99.\u00a0 Promising review: \"This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo\/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you thank you thank you! Sincerely, all the grateful ta-tas you've helped to care for\" \u2014Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes M\u2013XXL and in three colors).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I have very hard water that leaves hard-water buildup and nasty stains. It\u2019s embarrassing to have guests over because the toilets are so gross! I have tried so many products and cleaning solutions \u2014 from natural essential oils to harsh chemicals so strong I was lightheaded for the rest of the day. Well, I tried out this pumice stone after reading about it in a BuzzFeed article, and honestly the hype is real! It does take some elbow grease, but it's light enough that I didn\u2019t break a sweat! The stone does get used up, but I think this one should last me a couple of years at least. So if you have embarrassing toilets, try this!\" \u2014Stephanie Ray Get it from Amazon for $10.99+\u00a0(also available in a pack of two). Promising review:\u00a0\"This foot peel is THE TRUTH and got my feet right and smooth as butter! I\u2019ve never done a foot peel in my life and so I had a lot of hard skin under my foot to get rid of. I followed the instructions on the box, and decided to put on the foot peel on right before bed. You can feel the peel tingling and working while you have it on your feet so I felt relief. It took about three days after I did the peel to see the results starting. Do not get discouraged if you see peeling only at the toes. That\u2019s just the start of it...cause the next day I felt the mid of my foot arch bubble after my bath and a whole piece of skin was peeling. This peel did its job and some more! It has my feet feeling baby smooth and gave me a feeling of being in a salon without the polish. It felt good to pamper myself. This is my go-to from now on, when I want a good smooth foot AFTER a pedicure (because a pumice stone can\u2019t do what this peel can)!\" \u2014Shopinista Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.49+\u00a0(available in 10 scents and an unscented option). Promising review: \"Achieved holy grail status. My entire life I have had very weak nails that split. Regular manicures aren't helpful, neither are supplements or a healthy diet. No underlying health issues to contribute to this. I bought this a month ago on a recommendation. I'm pretty amazed that within three days I saw a significant improvement with the cuticles and my nails have been getting stronger ever since. For the first time ever my nails look healthy and strong and I can wear polish and still see benefits.\u00a0Some of the reviews talk about a weird cherry smell but I think I have a reformulated one that smells light and pleasant, like shea butter. I have since bought two more...one for the office and one for my car. GAME CHANGER!\" \u2014R. Weber Get it from Amazon for $7.94.

Promising review: \"I had five awfully painful plantar warts on my foot for about four months. They were all about a 1\/4 inch apart on the ball of my foot and I had a massive one under my second toe. It was becoming hard to walk with how painful they were. This was a Hail Mary and it worked phenomenally. The gel coats well right where you apply it. It doesn\u2019t have an awful stench. I applied it every three to four days for a couple of weeks. I noticed the pain was less and less until I didn\u2019t notice any. Last night I was actually able to pull and peel the remains of the dead warts out!! Kinda gross, but kind of cool.

Promising review: \"When I bought this I was really skeptical. I am grossed out by my hairbrush and clean it all the time. I've soaked it in vinegar and tea tree oil, used a toothbrush, scrubbed it with shampoo, picked it clean by hand \u2014 everything you can think of. Still, it's so hard to get the little lint that forms at the base of the brush \u2014 they don't dissolve off and you have to pick them off the bristles one by one because a toothbrush won't even break them up. This thing works amazingly. I don't know why, it just does \u2014 the particular texture of the bristles on this really grabs everything. It scraped the little lint rings right off and now my brush is cleaner, 10 times as fast.\" \u2014HeartsofHavoc Get it from Amazon for $11.95.

I am now able to sneeze or cough without peeing myself. Yes, that's right. I am able to hold my pee longer, which means I can actually make it to the bathroom without dribbling on myself. The best part is that just a few short weeks into the program you will have results you can feel. I think anyone who has ever had kids should try this out.\u00a0 \"The overall quality of my life has improved. Ditch your panty liners, stop the embarrassing dribbles, no more mad dashes to the rest room because of a weak bladder. Even my sex life has improved; I have control of those pelvic muscles now. Just remember to wash the weights before and after each use with an antibacterial spray, and allow time to air dry before putting them away. I say air dry because if you wipe them dry with a cloth you run the risk of giving yourself a bladder infection or urinary tract infection, and those are no laughing matter.

I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool.

It makes removal so much easier and gives more consistent removal than my previous method of washcloths or just scratching the cradle cap off with my fingernails. It\u2019s amazing and gross and wonderful. My babe doesn\u2019t even flinch when I spend 10 minutes clearing his scalp of all the goo. It seems to be soothing to him. I just apply baby shampoo, then brush a little with the blue brush. Then I slowly start to comb in sections all in one direction. Then I go back and forth in different directions. It\u2019s shocking the amount of dead skin that comes off. I\u2019ve even used it successfully in his eyebrows (he gets some cradle cap there, too).

I used to get embarrassed taking off my flats in my office because they smelled so bad, but not anymore! My work flats make my feet sweaty and this spray helps keep the awful odors away at least four to five days (probably longer but I was so excited I just sprayed my shoes again because I liked the smell haha!) The lemon is strong and the eucalyptus I love, so I would purchase again! Although it will likely last a while!

I had the exact same issue with hearing people on my iPhone 11 and was SO frustrated. But this worked instantly. Stuffed a square of the putty into the very small receiver you hear out of and for the first time in months I can hear people clearly and loudly out of my iPhone without being on speakerphone. I am so happy I don't have to get a new phone. I used them to clean my AirPods as well; it was good to see all the gunk come out despite not having an issue with sound for them.

I feel so much safer and comfortable walking on my own. This thing is LOUD and would definitely draw tons of attention.

I have very fine and very oily hair. I used to wash it daily but after getting a shag haircut I moved to every other day with lots of dry shampoo in between. I will never go back to aerosol dry shampoo again. I have used Batiste for many years but the smell and residue is too much. Application is super easy (it doesn\u2019t get EVERYWHERE!), you only need a small amount, and there is no smell.

What's a klutz with a high center of gravity to do while trying not to 1) fall down in front of approximately 150 guests or 2) keel over while quietly stifling tears during her friends' vows? Buy some Heel Stoppers, that's what! I was able to easily slip them onto the glitter-encrusted heels (and later remove them with no damage to the heels). On the day of the ceremony, these sturdy pieces of plastic made the heels much easier to walk in and prevented me from aerating the lawn. My feet still hurt to high heavens because those gorgeous shoes don't have a lot of support for a seldom stiletto-wearer like me. Out of all the dough I spent on my bridesmaid ensemble, these were the biggest bang for my buck!\" Get a pair on Amazon for $11.99\u00a0(available in four sizes).

You slide them on and, after a few minutes, feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. After that my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in.\u00a0The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days!\u00a0 Get a set of three pairs from Amazon for $11.97.\u00a0 Promising review: \"Saves me from auto logouts!

I use this all the time for my coffee from Starbucks, and it is amazing! I'll get iced coffee at 9 a.m. and still have ice in it at 7 p.m. I have many Frost Buddy products now, and their entire line is phenomenal.

Maynard Get it from Amazon for $23.98+ (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XL, two inseams, and eight styles).\u00a0 I bought this for spring and I am obsessed with it. It looks adorable on its own but also easily stacks with my other rings, and it's so comfortable that I often forget I'm wearing it. I am a huge fan of Pavoi jewelry and wear it almost exclusively because of how elegant, affordable, and durable all their pieces are, and so far this piece has held up to the very high standard they've set!\u00a0\u00a0 Promising review: \"Love.

It looks nice, holds 10\u201312 ounces, seals well (no leaks), and is sized such that I can slip it into my back pants pocket (most of the time, if they are somewhat roomy) or in a large coat or vest pocket. I take regular 1\u20132 mile hikes, and I was sick of carrying around water bottles holding twice as much water as I drink.\u00a0This works perfectly, no excess weight and easy to pocket.

Now I just keep a few wrapped up in the glove box that fit older connections. Great that the cables retract out of the way. Only complaint could be that it is rather large, but it is to be expected with four connections. Little car voltage display is nice to have as well (everyone should have one of these, by the voltage amount it shows if your alternator is working).\" \u2014Jaxmoto Get it from Amazon for $25.99 (also available in a version that *ONLY* has two Apple retractable chargers!).\u00a0 Promising review: \"I did not buy this luggage via Amazon, rather through\u00a0TikTok.

The smell isn\u2019t bad either! I didn\u2019t mind it, and my sister has requested some also (she gets bitten even more than I do).

The 'Cloudfoam' insole really does make it feel like your feet are walking on clouds. I thought that feeling might go away after several months of wear but the sneakers remain fluffy and relaxing. The sneakers were so comfortable that I started wearing them to the gym, to work, and even matching them with cute dresses for going-out looks. You'll probably want to order two pairs of these babies so you don't wear out a single pair after you fall in love.

Examples of ultra-processed foods include ice cream, sports drinks, mass-produced packaged breads, and margarine.  Recent studies have linked higher ultra-processed food consumption to an increased risk for health conditions such as cognitive decline, depression, and cancer.  For instance, research published in February found that greater intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increased risk for 32 adverse health outcomes, including heart issues, sleeping problems, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, and mental health conditions.  Now, a study recently published in The Lancet Regional Health \u2014 Europe suggests that consuming plant-based ultra-processed foods can also be bad for your health, potentially leading to increased cardiovascular disease and mortality risks.  Despite these implications, this is an observational study, which means it does not establish causality. More research is needed on the long-term health impacts of plant-based ultra-processed foods. For this study, researchers focused on plant-based ultra-processed foods due to the lack of comprehensive research on how these products affect health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular disease.  Lead study author Fernanda Rauber, PhD, a researcher at the Centre for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health (NUPENS) and the Department of Preventive Medicine at the School of Medicine at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, told Medical News Today: \u201cPlant-based foods are recommended in many dietary guidelines, and this area has been explored by the food industry, which uses health claims \u2014 vegetarian, vegan, plant-based \u2014 to promote its products. With a growing population adopting plant-based diets, studying the role of food processing in plant-based dietary patterns and its relation to cardiovascular diseases can help refine guidelines to incorporate considerations about food processing in their recommendations.\u201d  Rauber explained the main difference between animal-based and plant-based ultra-processed foods is that plant-based ones contain mainly plant-derived ingredients, so they do not include ingredients like meat, dairy, eggs, or cheese.  \u201cWith the growing public interest in adopting plant-based diets and dietary recommendations promoting plant-based eating, the food industry often uses these recommendations for marketing,\u201d Rauber continued.  \u201cThis can lead to the misleading perception that their products are healthy or beneficial for the planet, which is not always the case.\u201d Rauber and her team analyzed data from almost 127,000 participants of the UK Biobank who provided dietary information between 2009 and 2012 and received a median follow-up of nine years.  Scientists discovered that for every 10% increase in calorie intake from plant-based ultra-processed foods, participants had a 5% increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 12% higher risk of death from cardiovascular diseases.  \u201cWe hypothesized that the industrial processing of foods would influence the relationship between plant-based food intake and cardiovascular disease, but we didn\u2019t know to what extent,\u201d Rauber said.  \u201cWe were surprised by how consistently the results showed that consuming plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods was associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease while consuming plant-sourced ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk. However, the consumption of all plant-based foods showed no association with cardiovascular disease risk,\u201d Rauber continued. Also, during the study, researchers found that every 10 percentage point increase in calories from plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods consumed was associated with a 7% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a 13% lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease.  \u201cThe higher the consumption of plant-sourced non-ultra-processed foods, the lower the risk of these diseases,\u201d Rauber explained.  \u201cThis underscores the importance of not just consuming plant-based foods, but specifically choosing those that are minimally processed to maximize health benefits. Our findings underscore the importance of not just focusing on plant-based diets, but also considering the level of processing of these foods,\u201d she continued.  \u201cDoctors can use this information to emphasize to their cardiovascular disease patients that while plant-based diets can be beneficial, it is crucial to limit the consumption of all ultra-processed foods, including those that are plant-based. They should explain how minimally processed plant-based foods are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, guiding patients to make healthier dietary choices.\u201d  \u2014 Fernanda Rauber, PhD, lead study author After reviewing this study, Jennifer Wong, MD, a board certified cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told MNT that the findings are in line with diets recommended by the American Heart Association, such as the DASH diet. \u201cStudies like these remind us that when encouraging patients to avoid animal products high in saturated fat and seek more plant-based options, [we should] also bring up the importance of seeking whole foods and avoid processed packaged foods even if plant-based,\u201d Wong continued.  \u201cI\u2019d be curious to see if there would be a difference in outcomes based on different types of processed foods like those eating processed foods with lower fat content of any type or lower salt and sugar have better outcomes,\u201d Wong said. MNT also spoke with Monique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, who said she was not surprised by the observations linking those who consumed more non-ultra-processed plant-based foods with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease and those who consumed plant-based ultra-processed foods with a higher risk.  \u201cMarketing messages can often be confusing for the general public,\u201d Richard explained. \u201cIf they understand something to be made of plants and understand that they are encouraged to eat more, they may perceive it is healthier than the animal counterpart.\u201d  \u201c\u2019Plant-based\u2019 does not automatically equate to nutritious. Often, meat analogs and ultra-processed foods have added sugar, salt, fat, cholesterol, [and] preservatives, or [they] are so processed that they no longer include the original beneficial components such as fiber or the phytochemicals and water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, folate, or riboflavin,\u201d Richard continued.  \u201cIf consumed in excess, there is a potential that these ingredients can also lead to increased risk of cardiometabolic markers such as elevated LDL, low HDL, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein or advanced glycation end products.\u201d \u2014 Monique Richard, registered dietitian nutritionist Richard said choosing whole food or whole food ingredients when possible will allow you to glean the most health benefits of plant-based foods. \u201cThink about applesauce \u2014 it literally is made from mashed apples, but the fiber is mechanically altered, sugar is often added, and it often does not include skin, which depreciates its nutritiousness further,\u201d she explained.  \u201cThe benefits of the apple in its entirety have now been reduced from the whole food to another product. With each step of processing and manipulating, the integrity of the entire package is compromised. Does that mean applesauce is not good for us? No. This simply is an illustration of the varying degrees [a] food\u2019s nutritional value can change,\u201d Richard noted. For those looking for healthier options to plant-based ultra-processed foods, Richard suggested these swaps:  Share this article Scientists managed to create a 7-day 'healthy' meal plan out of ultra-processed foods but in term of nutritional value, it fell short in two areas.

However, experts are determined to figure out how to best help people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and recent research in this area is hopeful. A recent study published in Alzheimer\u2019s Research & Therapy examined how intensive lifestyle interventions can help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  In a 20-week intervention, researchers found that combining lifestyle interventions like following a plant-based diet, exercising, managing stress, and attending group support meetings may help improve cognitive function. The results point to potential intervention paths to help people with early dementia or interventions to possibly prevent dementia.  Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a condition that results in brain changes and impacts over six million people in the United States alone. People with Alzheimer\u2019s disease often experience a progressive decline in their cognitive function and memory. They may struggle with memory loss, personality changes, and declines in judgment. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is also the most common dementia type, making it a particularly important area for research focus. Shannel Kassis Elhelou, Psy.D., geropsychology and neuropsychology fellow at Pacific Neuroscience Institute\u2019s Brain Wellness and Lifestyle Programs in Santa Monica, CA, who was not involved in the study, noted the following about Alzheimer\u2019s disease to Medical News Today: \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease significantly impacts quality of life and function through progressive declines in memory, cognitive functioning (attention, processing speed, problem-solving, word finding), tasks of daily living (managing finances, driving, medication management, household duties), as well as changes in mood (increased irritability, anxiety, depression, or apathy).\u201d \u201cOver time, Alzheimer\u2019s disease leads to declines in physical health, reducing mobility and increasing the risk of falls. Overall, these effects result in social isolation and substantial caregiver burden, further impacting the individual and caregivers\u2019 quality of life,\u201d Elhelou said. There are medications that help people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but experts are also interested in how lifestyle interventions can also help. These lifestyle interventions were the focus of the current study. For the current study, researchers wanted to examine if a combination of non-medication interventions could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial that included fifty-one participants. All participants had mild cognitive impairment or early dementia from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The average age for participants was 73.5 years. Researchers excluded participants who had moderate or severe dementia and those who could not participate in regular exercise. Researchers divided participants into two groups. The control group received standard care, and the intervention group received standard care and took part in four key lifestyle interventions: Overall, the intervention period lasted 20 weeks, and two participants from the intervention group withdrew. Researchers provided intervention participants with food, assistance with exercise, supervision of stress management techniques, and access to support group meetings. Researchers used several measurements to assess the success of the interventions, including four assessment tools: the AD assessment Scale\u2014cognitive Subscale, Clinical Global Impression of Change, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Clinical Dementia Rating Global. They also examined certain biomarkers and microbiome taxa.  The control group showed declines in all four assessments of cognition and function. In contrast, the intervention group showed improvement in three of the assessments. In the last assessment, the intervention group showed less progression than the control group.  In addition, the intervention group showed improvement in microbiome configuration and improvement in clinically relevant biomarkers compared to controls. Study author Dean Ornish, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, noted the following highlights of the research to Medical News Today: \u201cWhat makes our research unique is that it\u2019s the first time a randomized controlled clinical trial has demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention, without drugs, significantly improved cognition and function after 20 weeks in many patients with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response correlation between the degree of lifestyle changes in both groups and the degree of change in most measures of cognition and function testing. In short, the more these patients changed their lifestyle in the prescribed ways, the greater was the beneficial impact on their cognition and function.\u201d\u2014 Dean Ornish, study author While the results don\u2019t mean that everyone in the intervention group experienced an improvement in cognition, they do mark superior outcomes to standard care interventions. Ornish noted that \u201cNot all patients in the intervention group improved; in the CGIC test, 71% improved or were unchanged. In contrast, none of the patients in the control group improved, eight were unchanged, and 17 (68%) worsened.\u201d Should future research confirm these findings, the interventions could see greater emphasis as a way to help people with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It may also have implications for Alzheimer\u2019s disease prevention. This research does have several limitations.  First, it included a fairly small sample size, so it could help to replicate the findings with larger groups, and the results cannot be generalized. Researchers were also unable to include certain individuals in the intervention, such as those who didn\u2019t have a caregiver who could help with study adherence.  Since the research focused on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it\u2019s also unclear how the interventions would help individuals with other dementia types. Researchers note the increased likelihood of a type II error in certain measurements related to ethnic and racial diversity.  The study is also limited by its design, such as how it was not double-blinded. Researchers also did not conduct brain structure measurements, which could have given an even better picture of the results. The intervention period lasted only 20 weeks, so future research could have more extended intervention and follow-up times and include more diversity among study participants. The interventions were also complex, making it not entirely clear if any of them are superior in how they help people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  In addition, some data relied on participant reporting, which is not the most accurate data collection method. The researchers acknowledge that some participants may have been better able to adhere to the intervention, which may have been why these participants saw improved cognition. The researchers also acknowledge that \u201cThe findings on the degree of lifestyle change required to stop the worsening or improve cognition and function need to be interpreted with caution. Since data from both groups were combined, it was no longer a randomized trial for this specific analysis, so there could be unknown confounding influences.\u201d However, the results still offer hope for people and their loved ones who are impacted by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and point to more extensive research in the future. Elhelou noted the following: \u201cI hope to see more providers discussing this information with their patients and I am enthusiastic about future research in this area. These findings underscore the potential of non-pharmacological interventions in the treatment of MCI [mild cognitive impairment] and early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ongoing research can further support their ability to influence healthcare guidelines by promoting lifestyle modifications as a crucial strategy for slowing the progression of MCI and early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d Share this article In this episode of our podcast, MNT investigates how sounds, silence, and music affect our cognitive health, and whether it can be a powerful tool for\u2026 Dr. Borja del Pozo Cruz, who has studied the relationship between longevity and different forms of exercise, and Dr. Edwina Brocklesby, or 'Iron\u2026 Dr. Kamar Ameen-Ali, who specializes in neurodegenerative diseases, and Paula Field, who is a caregiver for a parent with Alzheimer's, talk about the\u2026 MNT shares the three podcast episodes that inspired them to change their habits surrounding nutrition, chronic pain, and helping others, whiel sharing\u2026 In this episode, Medical News Today discusses whether intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating practices are safe for the heart, especially in\u2026 OUR BRANDS"},{"author":"Paul Ian Cross, PhD","title":"Weight loss: How intense exercise may backfire, leading to weight gain","url":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/intense-exercise-may-cause-weight-gain","description":"New research shows intense exercise may unexpectedly contribute to weight gain by reducing subsequent physical activity and lowering body temperature. This effect may be linked to disruptions in the circadian rhythm of the stress hormone corticosterone.","date":"2024-06-13T17:29:59Z","content":"Exercise involves taking part in physical activities that elevate heart rate above resting levels. Physical activity plays an essential role in maintaining physical and mental well-being and is frequently recommended as an effective strategy for weight loss. Whether individuals opt for light activities like walking or more intense exercises such as uphill cycling or weight lifting, regular physical activity offers a wide array of benefits for the body and mind. Engaging in daily exercise of any intensity is vital for preventing various diseases and health problems. However, a recent mouse study, published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, suggests that intense exercise sessions may lead to reduced subsequent physical activity and lower body temperature, which may contribute to weight gain. The researchers also evaluated how circadian rhythm, the body\u2019s natural sleep and wake cycle, played a role in activity by examining the stress hormone corticosterone, which regulates the circadian rhythm.  While exercise has numerous health benefits, its impact on weight loss can sometimes be less than anticipated. This could be due to a decrease in physical activity following exercise, though the exact mechanism remains unclear. Corticosterone, which follows a circadian rhythm \u2014 is lowest at bedtime and peaks around the time we wake up \u2014regulates both physical and mental activity levels. In this study, researchers hypothesized that even a single session of high-intensity exercise could disrupt this rhythm, leading to decreased physical activity, lower heat production and diminished weight loss effects. To test this hypothesis, mice were divided into three groups: high-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise and rest. Their physical activity and core body temperature, indicators of heat production, were monitored before and after exercise. The researchers also noted a disruption in the synchrony between physical activity and body temperature. They confirmed a positive correlation where relatively low blood corticosterone levels during wake times were associated with reduced physical activity. These findings indicate that a single session of high-intensity exercise can disrupt corticosterone\u2019s circadian rhythm, leading to decreased physical activity, lower body temperature and weight gain. This study underscores the importance of considering not just the calories burned during exercise but also the subsequent activity levels and circadian rhythm when designing exercise regimens for effective weight loss. Lead researcher Takashi Matsui, PhD, from the Institute of Health and Sport Sciences at the University of Tsukuba in Japan, explained the key findings to Medical News Today: \u201cOur study found that while exercise is a powerful strategy for weight loss, a single session of high-intensity exercise that induces heavy sweating can significantly reduce subsequent physical activity and core body temperature, leading to weight gain. Interestingly, this weight gain occurs despite no changes in food intake.\u201d Matsui added that \u201cthese phenomena are likely due to disruptions in the circadian rhythm of the stress hormone corticosterone and disturbances in the synchronization between physical activity and body temperature.\u201d \u201cTherefore, it is important to consider not only the energy expenditure during exercise but also the subsequent activity levels and circadian rhythm when setting appropriate exercise intensity for effective weight loss,\u201d Matsui said. Ryan Glatt, CP, senior brain health coach and director of the FitBrain Program at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, pointed out that \u201cthis animal study questions the benefits of vigorous exercise for weight loss, suggesting it might actually cause weight gain by reducing activity levels afterward and disrupting body temperature.\u201d \u201cThe research, conducted on mice, shows that high-intensity workouts may have complex effects on metabolism that aren\u2019t fully understood,\u201d Glatt said. Mark A. Anton, MD, medical director at Slimz Weightloss, also not involved in this research, described the study as fascinating. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that while vigorous exercise has its benefits, it can also lead to reduced activity levels outside of exercise sessions and potentially impact body temperature regulation. This can sometimes counteract weight loss efforts if not managed properly,\u201d Anton explained. Matsui highlighted that the research \u201cadds new evidence to the emerging theory that animals, including humans, tend to compensate for the energy expenditure of exercise (especially a single bout of high-intensity exercise) by reducing energy use in other activities.\u201d \u201cTherefore, it is crucial to recognize the beneficial effects of maintaining an active lifestyle beyond just exercise,\u201d Matsui noted. Glatt agreed, saying that, \u201coverall, this study suggests rethinking the focus on intense exercise, considering the potential benefits of more moderate and consistent activity for weight loss.\u201d However, \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that these results are from animal studies and may not directly apply to humans,\u201d Glatt highlighted. \u201cFor weight loss and weight management, I recommend a balanced approach that includes a mix of moderate-intensity aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking or cycling, combined with resistance training. This combination helps to burn calories, build muscle, and maintain a higher metabolic rate.

Previous genome-wide association studies into IBD, and some other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, had identified variants on a region of the genome as being linked to these conditions. The role they played in these diseases was unclear as this part of the genome was a \u201cgene desert\u201d which contained non-coding regions of DNA. There, they found a section of DNA that enhances the number of proteins that nearby genes make; this enhancer was translated only in macrophages, an immune cell with significant function in IBD. It essentially raised the volume on a gene called ETS2, a gene quite a long way away from this section of DNA, which scientists found was essential for almost all inflammatory functions in macrophages, including several that directly contribute to tissue damage in IBD. An increased amount of ETS2 activity in macrophages made them resemble inflammatory cells in patients with IBD. The findings were published in the journal Nature. There are no drugs that directly block ETS2, but the researchers found that MEK inhibitors \u2014 drugs that can be used to treat cancer \u2014 targetted other parts of this pathway and reduced inflammation in macrophages and gut samples from patients with IBD.  This development could help to identify drugs and drug targets to treat IBD, which has historically proved challenging. Irritable bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease, causes inflammation in the digestive tract, leading to a range of symptoms including pain, diarrhea, and less commonly constipation, weight loss, and problems absorbing nutrients. An estimated 6 million people worldwide have IBD, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that there are about 3 million people in the U.S. who have it. The root cause has not been identified, but a recent study suggests a connection between genetics, diet, and gut microbiota that could lead to developing IBD. Only about 10% of the drugs to treat such inflammatory or autoimmune diseases that enter the clinical development stage become fully approved for treatment, which the researchers for this paper say reflects a poor understanding of how these diseases work. This prompted their research, which was intended to explore how genetic pathways could contribute to these diseases.  Ruslan Medzhitov, PhD, sterling professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, told Medical News Today that the researchers\u2019 findings represent very important advances in the identification and targeting of genetic variants that can cause IBD and other medical issues. \u201cStudies that look for genetic associations with a particular disease often find signals (genomic variants) that do not match any specific genes. This makes it very hard to figure out how these variants impact on the disease development. In this case, such a genetic variant was mapped to a region of a part of the human genome where a long stretch of DNA is devoid of genes (so-called \u2018Gene Desert\u2019),\u201d Medzhitov said.  \u201cIn this study, researchers were able to discover that this genetic variant, known to be associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affected a piece of DNA that controlled the expression of a gene (called ETS2) located far away from the variant. This is the first major finding \u2014 connecting an \u2018anonymous\u2019 mutation to a specific gene. Secondly, they demonstrated that elevated expression of ETS2 in macrophages promotes their inflammatory functions, which would explain how it contributes to IBD development.\u201d\u2014 Ruslan Medzhitov, PhD \u015eebnem \u00dcnl\u00fci\u015fler, genetic engineer at the London Regenerative Institute, told Medical News Today that while the research is a step forward to understanding how inflammatory or autoimmune diseases operate, a broader test of the findings needs to be performed. \u201cThe study highlights the significant role of the ETS2 gene in mediating inflammation in macrophages, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). By identifying a specific enhancer within a gene desert that regulates ETS2, the research provides a deeper understanding of how genetic variations can contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions,\u201d \u00dcnl\u00fci\u015fler said.  \u201cOne potential flaw is that the study\u2019s experiments were mostly done in controlled lab settings, which might not fully replicate the complex environment in a living organism. More diverse and larger sample sizes could help confirm the findings,\u201d she added. \u201cIBD is a complex disease, with many genes making contributions to different degrees. This particular pathway may be relevant for a subset of IBD patients,\u201d Medzhitov said. \u201cBut a broader implication is that the approaches used here can be applied to other cases where genetic variants have unknown mechanistic connection to a disease (and not just IBD).\u201d \u00dcnl\u00fci\u015fler said that with more expansive application of the researchers\u2019 findings, the ability to attack autoimmune diseases could be greatly increased. But she cautioned that the delicate nature of such diseases \u2014 and their pathways in the body \u2014 can complicate treatments. \u201cIf these results apply broadly, they could lead to new treatments targeting ETS2, potentially reducing inflammation more effectively and with fewer side effects than current treatments. However, targeting ETS2 precisely might be challenging and needs careful development to avoid unintended effects on other bodily functions,\u201d she said.

But how generalizable are its findings?","date":"2024-06-13T16:53:16Z","content":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory illness of the central nervous system (CNS) with rising prevalence. It is a progressive condition, which means that it will likely worsen over time. MS is the most common debilitating neurodegenerative disease among young adults. Symptoms often appear between the ages of 20 and 40, but they can present at any age. Some experts believe that genetic and environmental factors, such as smoking, obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light may increase the likelihood of MS onset. Scientists at the Universit\u00e0 del Piemonte Orientale in Novaro, Italy scoured the vast UK Biobank for clues linking diet and lifestyle factors with the condition. Their findings appear in the journal Nutrients. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease which causes the immune system to attack myelin, a substance that coats nerve fibers. The illness is marked by lesions in the central nervous system, or CNS, which can cause physical or cognitive impairment. Such issues can lead to sensory disturbances, visual impairments, lack of coordination, and paralysis. Disease subtypes include clinically isolated syndrome, primary progressive MS, relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Female MS patients outnumber male counterparts two to one. Researchers have been studying this condition for a long time, continuously looking for interventions that could help people lower their odds of developing MS. One lifestyle factors that researchers have been looking at in relation to MS risk has been diet. Prior research conducted by some of the present study\u2019s authors had suggested that gut health may influence the CNS. In their current paper, they state that \u201cthe existence of a gut\u2013brain axis supports the importance of considering diet as an important modulator of gut homeostasis and, consequently, of CNS health.\u201d The scientists further note that a pro-inflammatory gut environment may elevate neuroinflammation and MS risk. The study\u2019s authors used data from the UK Biobank, one of the largest biomedical databases currently available. They did so to address \u201ca paucity of large-scale prospective studies regarding [\u2026] dietary exposures that are focused on the general population,\u201d as they explain in the paper. At its start, this study cohort included 502,507 residents of the United Kingdom aged 40\u201369 years. The presence of MS was determined by hospital admissions with MS diagnoses or self-reported diagnoses of MS. At the study\u2019s baseline, in 2006, all participants answered a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), through which they reported their usual consumption of 29 different food groups and alcohol over the previous year. Participants answered questions about their daily intake of cooked vegetables, raw vegetables, fresh and dried fruits. They also reported their weekly intake of fatty fish, processed meats, beef, lamb, poultry, cheese, salt added to food, and other foods. A subsample of participants also completed online interviews that recalled the previous 24 hours of dietary choices. The results were based on investigating 200 different foods and beverages. \u201cSince it [the online interview tool] automatically calculated the energy and nutritional contents of the reported food items, we were able to evaluate the impact of single micro- or macronutrient intake on the disease risk,\u201d the study authors write. They also used the dietary data to calculate the participants\u2019 Mediterranean Diet scores. After exclusions due to participant retractions or missing information, the final cohort included 499,563 people. The present study also considered the role that additional lifestyle factors may play in MS onset. The authors combed through data on body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity. An average of 12 years of follow-up data identified 478 MS cases developing among the study cohort. This indicates a prevalence rate of 7.78 MS cases for every 100,000 person-years. People who face an increased MS risk included those who smoked, had a vitamin D deficiency, or who had a history of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Genetic determinants for obesity and for obesity during childhood were also linked to an elevated MS risk. The study\u2019s authors observed an inverse correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean diet type and MS onset, suggesting that a healthy, plant- and whole-food-rich diet that included moderate fatty fish consumption may help protect against this chronic condition. To the study authors\u2019 knowledge, their work is the first to observe a \u201cslightly protective\u201d effect of moderate fish intake. Eating fatty fish once weekly appeared to be more protective than more frequent consumption. Medical News Today discussed the study findings with Kelsey Costa, MS, RDN, and Sarah Hormachea, MS, RD, BC-ADM, CDCES, both of them registered dietitians not involved in this research. Costa commented that \u201c[a] key strength of this study is its use of the UK Biobank database, a comprehensive resource that offers a vast amount of data from a large cohort.\u201d However, both dietitians expressed concerns about the study\u2019s limitations. Hormachea noted that \u201c[t]he UK Biobank cohort consists of volunteers [including mostly white and high-income individuals], which may not be representative of the general population.\u201c She cautioned that: \u201cParticipants who choose to join such studies often have different health behaviors and socio-economic statuses compared to those who do not participate.\u201d Costa also said that ethnic minority groups are underrepresented in the Biobank database, which may limit the generalizability of the study\u2019s findings to those populations. The potential for recall bias also stood out to Hormachea, as study participants might not have accurately remembered or reported their food intake. In turn, Costa felt that the small number of MS cases \u201cmay reduce the statistical power of the analysis.\u201c \u201cIn other words,\u201c she said \u201cit can be hard to accurately observe small effects unless you have very large sample sizes.\u201d Potential confounding factors, such as the nutrient density of the participants\u2019 diets, might have influenced the findings, Costa remarked. She pointed out that \u201cthe study did not assess cooking methods, food processing, and the nutrient composition of specific food items or types of alcoholic beverages.\u201d Lastly, she cautioned that due to the study\u2019s observational nature, causality cannot be established. Hormachea furthermore suggested that reverse causality could be an issue, as people diagnosed with MS might have changed their eating habits subsequently. MNT asked Costa if she has seen positive results from dietary adjustments among people with MS. She noted that different types of diets are likely to have different effects ion people living with this condition: \u201cBroadly speaking, hypercaloric diets can be problematic for multiple sclerosis, and conversely, low-calorie diets and diets high in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods may improve signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\u201d Nevertheless, she hypothesized that a Mediterranean diet may be able to help lower the risk of MS, especially compared to a typical Western diet. The study\u2019s authors believe that their \u201cvalidated approach\u201d of using 24-hour recall data has provided novel insights \u201cinsights into the role of complex dietary patterns, instead of single foods, in disease onset.\u201d Their data forms a basis for more specific studies which may help formulate evidence-based protocol for MS prevention and management.

After participants took the drug for three weeks, the scientists measured positive changes in the behavior of blood vessels in the brain. The study, called the OxHARP trial, lays the foundation for future clinical trials. Viagra, first designed to treat angina, rose to fame in the late 1990s as an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction. Because it is a relatively safe drug and affects a number of organs, such as the heart, liver, kidney, and brain, it is a good candidate for drug repurposing. For instance, scientists have already investigated whether sildenafil might help treat conditions including chronic pain, cancer, depression, kidney disease, and more. The latest study asks whether Viagra might help reduce the risk of developing vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a form of dementia caused by impaired blood flow or damaged blood vessels in the brain. It often occurs after a stroke. As the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia accounts for 15\u201320% of dementia cases in North America and Europe. Medical News Today spoke with Jos\u00e9 Morales, MD, a vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, CA.  Morales, who was not involved in the new study, told Medical News Today that \u201cthere are treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.\u201d However, \u201cThere is no cure,\u201d so identifying risk factors and ways to reduce those risks is important.  Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is one such risk factor. CSVD is an umbrella term for a number of conditions that affect small blood vessels in the brain.  MNT reached out to one of the study\u2019s authors, Alastair Webb, MSc, a consultant neurologist at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom. He provided an outline of CSVD: \u201cSmall vessel disease is chronic damage to the small blood vessels deep inside the brain, resulting in them becoming narrow, blocked, and leaky. This damage occurs to some extent in most people as they get older, but it is much more severe in some, often due to having high blood pressure for a long time.\u201d  \u201cThe resulting damage may further reduce blood flow to the deep part of the brain resulting in strokes and dementia,\u201d he explained.  In the recent study, the scientists recruited 75 people with neurological signs of CSVD. Every participant received 3-week regimens of sildenafil, placebo, and cilostazol \u2014 a treatment for vascular disease. Each course of drugs was separated by a \u201cwashout\u201d period of at least 1 week. Testing all three drugs on all participants is called a crossover trial. These studies are powerful because each participant acts as their own control. They also require fewer participants to achieve statistically meaningful results. The researchers focused on the following measures. MNT asked Webb why they decided to investigate sildenafil: \u201cIt causes blood vessels to open up, to increase blood flow and the responsiveness of blood vessels,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, it had the right type of action to improve the blood flow problems seen in our patients, but it was unclear whether it worked in the brain in the same way.\u201d The researchers found that sildenafil did not improve cerebral pulsatility compared with placebo. Although Webb \u201chad reason to believe that it would reduce pulsations,\u201d the team was not overly surprised that it did not work in this way. Importantly, though, sildenafil did improve cerebrovascular reactivity and resistance, and cerebral blood flow compared with placebo. Compared with cilostazol, Viagra performed similarly but produced fewer side effects, such as diarrhea. The authors conclude: \u201cOverall, the improved cerebrovascular dynamics with sildenafil provide a new potential treatment to prevent progression of [cerebral small vessel disease] that needs testing in clinical trials.\u201d Although it is still early days, this is a step toward understanding how to reduce the risk of vascular dementia.  MNT spoke with Rakesh C. Kukreja, PhD, professor of internal medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond, who was not involved in the study. On why Viagra might help reduce vascular dementia risk, Kukreja said: \u201cSildenafil is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which breaks down the powerful vasodilator molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).\u201d \u201cBy preventing the breakdown of cGMP, sildenafil promotes the relaxation of blood vessels and improves blood flow. Therefore, the enhanced cerebral blood flow and reduced vascular resistance from sildenafil treatment might influence the risk of dementia,\u201d he said. It is worth mentioning that this study\u2019s results line up with earlier research. For instance, a study using a rodent model of vascular dementia found that Viagra improved cognitive ability and memory. Other rodent studies produced similar findings. Also, studies in a human population concluded that Viagra usage was linked with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. Similarly, Kukreja outlined another study involving \u201cinsurance claim data for 7.23 million individuals.\u201d  In this study, he explained, \u201csildenafil was associated with a 69% reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d While further research is needed into Viagra and vascular dementia, there are lifestyle factors that can make a difference to an individual\u2019s risk. MNT spoke with Dr. Tim Beanland, head of knowledge at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society who was not involved in the study. He outlined some lifestyle risk factors for vascular dementia: \u201cWe know that what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, so a healthy diet and lifestyle, including not smoking or drinking too much alcohol, can help to lower your risk of dementia and other conditions like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers.\u201d  For individuals who already have dementia, he told MNT that \u201cthere is growing evidence to suggest that regular exercise, looking after your health, and keeping mentally and socially active can help to reduce the progression of dementia symptoms.\u201d  The results of this study suggest that sildenafil may help reduce the risk of vascular dementia in people with CSVD. However, it only measured changes to aspects of cerebral blood flow over a relatively short period of time. To get a clearer picture of whether Viagra and similar drugs truly can reduce risk, scientists will need to follow people for years to assess whether their risk is reduced. Webb plans to continue this line of investigation: \u201cIt is very important to follow up on this work. We need to do some further studies to work out the best dose of the drug, and the best drug from this group of drugs to take on further,\u201d he told MNT. \u201cWe are aiming to test it in a much larger trial to understand if it not only improves blood flow to the brain but also to test whether this reduces the risk of stroke and dementia,\u201d he added.

Researchers say they think genetic mutations may be the cause. Their findings were published today in the journal Nature Communications. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, but not all people who get lung cancer are smokers. In fact, 10% to 20% of people who get lung cancer have never smoked, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The causes of lung cancer among people who have never smoked remain unclear, but experts suspect a combination of environmental, genetic, and lifestyle-related factors play a role.  Lung cancer among non-smokers is the fifth leading cause of death in the world, according to Dr. Eric Singhi, an assistant professor of thoracic head and neck medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cAll you need to be at risk for lung cancer is to have lungs,\u201d Singhi, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. Targeted treatment is available for non-small cell lung cancer. However, researchers from University College London, the Francis Crick Institute, and drugmaker AstraZeneca found that the combination of two genetic mutations may explain why standard treatment is often ineffective among non-smokers. Targeted treatment fails in 10% to 15% patients, depending upon what kind of NCSLC is being treated, Dr. Manmeet Singh Ahluwalia of the Baptist Health Miami Cancer Institute who was not involved in the study told Medical News Today In their new study, researchers reported that a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) \u2014 present in up to half of non-smokers with NCSLC \u2014 combined with a mutation in the p53 gene resulted in the development of drug-resistant tumors. Researchers said that the only about a third of people with stage IV NSCLC and an EGFR mutation survive for up to three years. EGFR enables cancer cells to grow more quickly, whereas the p53 gene plays a role in tumor suppression.  Typically, NSCLC is treated with drugs called EGFR inhibitors, but the study found while tumors in people with just the EGFR mutations got smaller in response to treatment, some tumors actually grew after treatment among those with both the EGFR and p53 mutations. Lab and animal studies found that these growing, drug-resistant tumors had more cancer cells that had doubled their genome, giving them extra copies of all their chromosomes. In addition, cells with both the double mutation and double genomes were more likely to multiply into new drug-resistant cells. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown why having a p53 mutation is associated with worse survival in patients with non-smoking related lung cancer, which is the combination of EGFR and p53 mutations enabling genome doubling,\u201d said Charles Swanton, PhD, a study co-author and a professor at the UCL Cancer Institute and deputy clinical director at the Francis Crick Institute, said in a statement. \u201cThis increases the risk of drug-resistant cells developing through chromosomal instability.\u201d \u201cWhile whole genome doubling itself may not always cause cancer, it can contribute to cancer growth and disease progression in various ways,\u201d added Singh. Researchers noted that while non-small cell lung cancer patients are tested for EGFR and p53 mutations, there is no test currently available that can detect this dangerous genome doubling. Work on such a test is under way, however. \u201cOnce we can identify patients with both EGFR and p53 mutations whose tumors display whole genome doubling, we can then treat these patients in a more selective way,\u201d said Crispin Hiley, PhD, a study co-author and an associate professor at the UCL Cancer Institute. \u201cThis might mean more intensive follow-up, early radiotherapy or ablation to target resistant tumors, or early use of combinations of EGFR inhibitors, such as (AstraZeneca\u2019s) osimertinib, with other drugs including chemotherapy.\u201d \u201cTreatment strategies such as combination therapies (targeted therapy plus another treatment) have begun to emerge, aimed at preventing the emergence of resistance to a treatment,\u201d said Singhi. He noted that these include using osimertinib in combination with conventional chemotherapy or amivantamab, an bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, a gene that manufactures a protein involved in cellular signaling, growth, and survival. \u201cThese trials are looking to prove whether two types of treatments together and upfront, offer better clinical outcomes for our patients than one targeted therapy alone,\u201d he said. \u201cA very valid concern, however, is that combination therapies tend to be more toxic for our patients, and it can be difficult to discern which patient would benefit more one therapy versus another.\u201d Dr. Shuresh Ramalingam, an executive director of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Georgia and a non-small cell lung cancer expert who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today that new therapies can be tailored to address NSCLC cases where EGFR inhibitors are ineffective. \u201cWhen targeted treatments stop working, it is not uncommon for physicians to conduct molecular testing to determine if there are new mutations in the tumor,\u201d said Ramalingam, who is currently working on a new intervention for treating Stage III NSCLC tumors that cannot be removed surgically. \u201cThis knowledge informs appropriate interventions that could overcome the resistance mechanism. For example, for patients with EGFR mutation, a known resistance mechanism with targeted therapy is a new mutation known as the C797S mutation. There are new experimental drugs that are capable of overcoming this specific resistance mechanism in clinical trials.\u201d The proportion of lung cancers occurring in individuals who have never smoked has increased in the past several decades, particularly among women and in younger age groups, said Ahluwalia.  \u201cApproximately two-thirds of [these] cases occur in women, making women who have not smoked more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer than men who have not smoked,\u201d he said.

They typically use official recommendations from governing bodies and relevant medical organizations to help guide their clinical practice recommendations. Groups update these guidelines based on components like newly available data. Researchers want to understand how these guideline changes affect clinical practice and medication recommendations. A study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicinelooked at two equation sets to measure 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk and how they affected primary prevention statin therapy recommendations. Researchers used a weighted sample of 3,785 adults. The results indicated that using the one equation set, PREVENT, greatly reduced the average estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The researchers calculated that using PREVENT equations could also decrease the number of adults who meet eligibility criteria for primary prevention statin use from 45.4 million to 28.3 million. The results suggest major changes could occur in the number of people prescribed statins if the PREVENT equations are used. As noted by the American Heart Association, \u201catherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is caused by the buildup of plaque within the arteries, limiting the flow of blood to important organs.\u201d Several atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related conditions can lead to serious bodily harm, such as heart attacks and strokes. Sometimes, doctors may prescribe statins to people who are at particular risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins are also sometimes prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels. Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, not involved in the current research explained to Medical News Today that \u201c[s]tatins are commonly used in clinical practice in two scenarios: In people who have already suffered a cardiovascular event such as heart attack or stroke, or in people with risk factors for developing heart disease.\u201d \u201cFor people who have already had a heart attack or stroke, we recommend a \u2018high-intensity\u2019 statin, such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin,\u201d he told us. \u201cFor everyone else, the decision to start a statin depends on our evaluation of their risk for developing cardiovascular disease in the future. This includes an assessment of their risk factors for heart disease, such as a high blood pressure and\/or diabetes. To help us decide whether to start someone on a statin, we will frequently use a risk calculator to estimate someone\u2019s 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\u201d \u2013 Cheng-Han Chen, MD The researchers who conducted the current study explain that the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology initially developed pooled cohort equations (PCEs) in 2013. These equations helped calculate a person\u2019s estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, these equations may not be entirely accurate, particularly for groups that were underrepresented in the initial cohorts that derived the PCEs. In 2023, the American Heart Association Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Scientific Advisory Group developed a new set of equations to predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This set of equations, the PREVENT equations, does not include race but instead adds in other measurements like kidney function, the social deprivation index, and statin use. The current cross-sectional study looked at how the PCEs and PREVENT equations differ in risk prediction and recommendations for primary prevention statin therapy. Researchers used data from the United States\u2019 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). They included adults aged between 40 and 75 who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The sample size, 3,785 adults, was representative of the U.S. population. Researchers analyzed the data using both equation groups \u2014 PCEs and PREVENT equations \u2014 to examine 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. However, they did not include data on the social deprivation index because this was unavailable through the survey data. They used the 2019 ACC\/AHA guidelines to determine primary prevention statin therapy eligibility criteria. These guidelines recommend statin therapy for adults between forty and seventy-five who have diabetes, high cholesterol levels, or an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of 7.5% or more. They were then able to calculate the number and proportion of U.S. adults who would experience changes in statin recommendations based on the PCEs to PREVENT equation differences. The study found that the estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease went from 8% using PCEs to 4.3% using PREVENT equations. They observed the most drastic difference for Black adults, whose risk went from 10.9% to 5.1%, and adults between 70 and 75, whose risk went from 22.8% to 10.2%. Thus, the use of PREVENT equations could lead to a general shift into lower-risk categories for a number of individuals. Researchers further estimated that the statin recommendations for U.S. adults would drop from 45.4 million to 28.3 million with a change from PCEs to PREVENT equations. They also noted that many adults eligible to take statins based on PREVENT equations were not taking statins, equating to 15.8 million adults. This research does have some limitations. First, data from NHANES relies on self-reporting, and not everyone responds to the survey, which can lead to errors. Data collection also did not note the dosage of statin medications, medication adherence, or changes in HDL cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the researchers did not stratify atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk by other risk enhancers, or examine the use of other lipid-lowering therapies. The researchers did include individuals with certain outlier values for both calculators, even though clinical practice usually excludes these individuals. Another issue was that the authors were not able to look at LDL cholesterol levels separately in their primary analysis although they did take it into account in sensitivity analyses. Thus, they could have underestimated statin eligibility at the population level. The researchers note that they could not determine which risk score is most accurate in today\u2019s practice, so more studies are needed to determine the most helpful risk-assessment equations in clinical practice. They further note that doctors could consider moving away from precise treatment thresholds and towards better risk communication with people. Chen commented that it could also lead to changing risk thresholds. He explained to MNT that: \u201cDepending on how future guidelines are written, this could result in fewer patients being recommended statin therapy. As statins are known to be very helpful in preventing cardiovascular disease, any future guidelines may need to adjust the risk thresholds we use for starting statin therapy.\u201d Regular use of PREVENT equations could also mean doctors utilize additional tests to make recommendations.  Michael Broukhim, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, also not involved in the current research, emphasized that \u201c[t]he potential clinical implications are there may be an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events if less patients are treated for hyperlipidemia.\u201d \u201cUtilizing additional testing, such as coronary artery calcium scoring or lipoprotein a testing, may be more important to decide whether patients would benefit from statin therapy,\u201d he advised.

This widely prescribed medication helps regulate blood glucose and has other beneficial health effects. These may include: A recent study published in Cancers examined metformin\u2019s anti-cancer properties. Using colorectal cancer cells, researchers found molecular pathways that may explain metformin\u2019s anti-cancer effects. The researchers treated HCT116 colorectal cancer cells \u2014 a highly aggressive type of cancer cell line \u2014 with a sub-lethal dose (2.5mM) of metformin. Using several different techniques to analyze the drug\u2019s effects on the cells\u2019 RNA, they found that metformin altered the activity of some microRNAs (miRNAs, which are short, single-stranded lengths of RNA that regulate genes). Some were upregulated, meaning their activity increased; others were downregulated. \u201cIn this particular study, there is some suggestion that metformin may play a role in the downregulation of genes specific to colon cancer,\u201d Nilesh Vora, MD, board certified hematologist and medical oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA, told Medical News Today.  It\u2019s a novel mechanism that may have implications in other cancers. Since metformin is a relatively harmless and low-cost drug, this may have a tremendous impact on other cancers,\u201d Vora noted. Metformin is a widely available therapy for type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of which is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045. The medication helps the body respond to insulin \u2014 the hormone that controls blood glucose. It also decreases the amount of sugar that the liver produces and that the intestines or stomach absorb. However, studies have not yet uncovered the precise mechanisms underlying these effects. , surgical oncologist, and the chief of medicine and director of the Gastrointestinal and Hepatobiliary Program at Providence Saint John\u2019s Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, CA, explained to MNT: \u201cMetformin is typically used to treat type 2 diabetes and although it has been shown to have an anti-cancer effect the mechanism has not been well understood. This study provides a possible mechanism through micro RNAs inhibiting cell growth and proliferation. This is particularly important since it opens the potential to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting these micro RNAs.\u201d Two upregulated miRNAs \u2014 miR-2110 and miR-132-3p \u2014 directly targeted a gene signaling pathway often disrupted in human cancers. This slowed down the rate at which the cancer cells grew and multiplied.  Another two miRNAs \u2014 miR-222-3p and miR-589-3p \u2014 targeted another pathway, which resulted in suppressed cell growth and delaying of the cell cycle. If similar effects are seen in tumors in people and not just cells, these findings with metformin could potentially lead to alternative treatments for some cancers. \u201cMetformin has been available for a long time and is relatively inexpensive,\u201d Bilchik said. \u201cThere is potential for its use to be extended to other cancers, but more important, this study provides insights into the development of novel therapeutic agents.\u201d  The researchers caution that their findings were in isolated cells that were cultured in a high-glucose medium, which does not exactly mimic the conditions found in the human body.  However, they recommend that their experiments be repeated using cells cultured in media that more closely resemble the physiological nutrient levels found in tumors. RNA therapeutics are a new approach to cancer treatment. Research shows that noncoding RNAs (which include the microRNAs in this study) are dysregulated in many types of cancer, including:  Some miRNAs increase the likelihood of cancers, others decrease it, and the same miRNA can have different effects on different cancers. MiRNAs have two advantages over other cancer treatments \u2014 they are naturally occurring molecules in cells and they target several genes in one pathway. This means that they can cause a broad, but specific response. Currently, several studies are investigating the use of miRNAs as cancer therapeutics, particularly how they can be delivered into cells. This study provides new insights into metformin\u2019s effect on the molecular mechanisms inside cells and why it reduces proliferation of cancer cells, emphasising the role of miRNAs in colorectal cancer.  The authors suggest their findings highlight the potential for developing RNA therapeutics for cancer prevention and treatment and possibly for targeted interventions. Although there are several challenges in the field of miRNA therapeutics, this study could signal another step in their development as potential cancer treatments.

Experts note the pathology of depression and memory loss overlap within the brain.","date":"2024-06-14T15:39:06Z","content":"A new study demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between depression and memory loss.  Scientists have long known that mood and memory are connected, but this is the first study, its authors say, that specifically investigates the relationship between the two. The study found that people with greater depressive symptoms experienced accelerated memory loss. The researchers note the reverse was also true: Significant memory loss resulted in a higher level of depressive symptoms. In other words, each condition exacerbated the other. The researchers analyzed 16 years of data from 8,268 participants, each of whom was examined in alternating years from 2002\u20132003 through 2018\u20132019. These were community-dwelling English adults aged 50 or older, with a mean age of 64 at the start of the study. Of this cohort, 55% were female. \u201cThe novel element of our work is that we established that the relationship between memory decline and depression is bidirectional,\u201d senior investigator Dorina Cadar, PhD, a lecturer in neuro-epidemiology and dementia at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom, told Medical News Today. The study is published in JAMA Network Psychiatry. Viewing the two conditions as two sides of the same coin suggests new hope for those living with depression, memory loss, or both. David Merrill, MD, PhD, director of the Brain Health Center at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute, CA, not involved in the study, told MNT that prior to this study, researchers had looked at depression and memory loss independently, \u201ctrying to parse them apart as though they\u2019re separate.\u201d But Merrill noted it has long been understood that memory and mood are strongly linked. \u201cIf you\u2019re studying memory, you need to control for mood,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cThe substrate of the creation of both phenomena is coming out of the same thing,\u201d he added, noting the similarities between depression and dementia. Merrill said the activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are similar in both conditions. When there\u2019s a decrease in frontal lobe activity \u2014 as is seen with depression \u2014 there is a reduced ability to hold things in working memory, Merrill explained. \u201cThe circuitry and the cells and the synapses involved in memory formation have a profound overlap with the circuitry involved in moods, mood regulation, and mood formation,\u201d Merrill said.  Cadar explained that depression and memory have chemistry in common, including the \u201cdysregulation of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which play crucial roles in mood regulation and cognitive abilities.\u201d \u201cIn depression, the imbalance of these neurotransmitters can impair synaptic plasticity, which is essential for learning and memory formation,\u201d Cadar said. \u201cSerotonin is involved in the modulation of mood and cognition, and its deficit can lead to reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory consolidation.\u201d The growth and survival of neurons in the hippocampus, Cadar continued, can also be threatened by high cortisol levels that often accompany depression. \u201cProlonged exposure to high cortisol levels can lead to hippocampal atrophy, which is already commonly observed in older individuals with major depressive disorder,\u201d Cadar said, adding that harmful inflammatory responses may result from depression.  \u201cDepression is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines\u2026 that can alter neurotransmitter metabolism, reduce synaptic plasticity, and damage brain structures involved in memory such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Inflammation-induced neurotoxicity can, therefore, contribute to cognitive deficits observed in depressed individuals.\u201d \u2014 Dorina Cadar, PhD, senior study investigator Finally, depression \u2014 especially in older people \u2014 can cause insomnia, depriving the brain of the critical memory consolidation that occurs in deep sleep, Cadar noted. Dementia may cause mood and behavioral changes, while depression may lead to forgetfulness, which may cause some confusion around these two very distinct \u2014 albeit related \u2014 conditions. \u201cDepression, has historically been called \u2018pseudo dementia\u2019 in older adults, as it\u2019s been appreciated as sort of a reversible cause of dementia,\u201d Merrill said. Unlike neurodegenerative dementia, which involves the irreversible death of brain cells, \u201cpseudo dementia\u201d stems from depression that causes brain cells to be less active. In depression, less active brain cells could still be reactivated.  \u201cThe decrease in brain activity [that occurs with depression] really leads to decreased capacity to form memories,\u201d Merrill said. In addition to all the physiological factors, when a experiences loss in memory capacity, Cadar noted \u201cthis cognitive impairment can lead to increased frustration, stress, and feelings of isolation.\u201d \u201cThese can trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms and associated loneliness that is equally detrimental for mental abilities,\u201d Cadar said. The findings of this study, have \u201csignificant implications for future treatment approaches for both conditions and highlighting the need for integrated treatment approaches rather than treating them in isolation,\u201d Cadar said. Treatment might address both conditions simultaneously, and healthcare providers might develop new early screening programs that monitor older people for both mood and memory. Merrill noted this would require a new interdisciplinary approach, bringing together psychologists and neurologists.  For now, Merrill said it\u2019s imperative for the individual to aim to change one aspect of their mindset, given the nature of depression, if they hope to feel happier and restore memory function. \u201cThe problem is depression really robs you of motivation,\u201d he added. According to Merrill, physical activity may be the best course of treatment for both conditions. \u201cExercise is probably the best single intervention for the aging body and the aging brain,\u201d he said. Merrill proposed a future therapy that could involve consulting with your doctor and getting a prescription for physical therapy (PT). This could provide a helpful structure from which to begin digging your way out of depression while also improving memory. \u201cYou have a scheduled appointment with the therapist and you have a trainer who\u2019s happy to see you. All those things are just really activating,\u201d he envisioned. The value of this plan, Merrill said, goes beyond the body and brain health benefits. \u201cYou develop friendships, and you develop relationships and bonds. A huge part of depression is this social isolation of losing connectedness,\u201d he noted. Share this article Research shows a strong link between Alzheimer's disease and depression.

That\u2019s according to research presented at the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery\u2019s 2024 annual scientific meeting. The study, which hasn\u2019t been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, included 113 participants with more than 70 of them attempting to lose weight before bariatric surgery through various ways.  Those methods included: The researchers reported that those on multiple medications for between 6 months and 12 months had the most significant weight loss, losing an average of 13% of body weight. Participants taking a single GLP-1 had the second most weight loss (8%), and those using diet and exercise had the least (6%). \u201cI do agree and prefer patients lower their BMI [body mass index] to be in the 50s before surgery,\u201d said Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. \u201cWe can\u2019t always use GLPs as they aren\u2019t always covered by insurance and they can be too expensive without the insurance. \u201cIn those cases, we have the patient work with a diet counselor,\u201d Ali, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, told Medical News Today. \u201cSometimes, we recommend a liquid diet. Losing weight before surgery can be quite helpful. It can provide a jump start to weight loss that continues after the surgery.\u201d \u201cOverall, metabolic surgery is safe \u2013 safer than gall bladder surgery, which is considered safe and routine,\u201d Ali added. Researchers said that weight loss before bariatric surgery can lower the risk of complications. The scientists indicated that people with a BMI higher than 70 had the greatest risk of complications. Lifestyle or first-generation medications hadn\u2019t significantly lowered potential complications. \u201cCombining anti-obesity medications may achieve much greater pre-surgery weight loss than other methods for those with extreme obesity,\u201d said Dr. Phil Schauer, the director of the Metamor Metabolic Institute at Pennington Biomedical in Louisiana, said in a press release. \u201cMany patients who would otherwise be considered \u2018too sick for surgery\u2019 may now qualify.\u201d Body mass index (BMI) is a ratio of a person\u2019s height to weight that can help estimate body fat. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 and above is considered having obesity. BMI does not account for age, gender, or ethnicity. It also does consider muscle mass. According to Yale Medicine, someone with a high level of muscle and very little fat can have the same BMI as a person with obesity. An athlete or someone who is active can show up in the overweight or obese range when measuring only BMI. Medical professionals using BMI as an overweight\/obesity indicator should take into consideration factors such as different ethnicities before using it. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance for using BMI for Asian populations. For example, people in this population with a high risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease show the risk at a substantially lower BMI than white European populations. BMI should be used in conjunction with other risk measurements, such as visceral fat, body adiposity, body composition, genetic factors, and metabolic factors, according to Yale Medicine. In 2022, there were nearly 280,000 metabolic and bariatric surgeries in the United States. This was only about 1% of those who met eligibility for the surgery based on their BMI. Obesity affects about 42% of adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Excess weight can potentially weaken or impair the immune system and increase chronic inflammation. People with obesity are more at risk of developing cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. \u201cMore studies are needed to determine the optimal role of GLP-1s before and after metabolic and bariatric surgery among different patient groups,\u201d Dr. Marina Kurian, ASMBS president and a clinical professor in the Department of Surgery, Division of Bariatric Surgery at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York who was not involved in the study, said in a press release. \u201cObesity must be viewed like other chronic diseases where sometimes more than one therapy is necessary over time and for different reasons.\u201d Share this article Researchers say a new study indicates that bariatric weight loss surgery is more effective in managing type 2 diabetes than medications and lifestyle\u2026 Researchers say that bariatric weight loss surgery can improve heart health as well as lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in addition to\u2026 Researchers say bariatric surgery is more effective and has longer lasting impacts for weight loss than GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and lifestyle\u2026 New research shows intense exercise may unexpectedly contribute to weight gain by reducing subsequent physical activity and lowering body temperature\u2026 New research argues that the oral alternative to injected semaglutide could also help improve the symptoms of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
